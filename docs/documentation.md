# Introduction

**tomes_tool** is part of the [TOMES](https://www.ncdcr.gov/resources/records-management/tomes) project.

It is written in Python.

Its purpose is to:

1. Create a deliverable version of an [EAXS](http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/SHRAB/ar/emailpreservation/mail-account/mail-account_docs.html) file(s) - an XML schema for storing email account information.
2. Package the original EAXS file(s) and the deliverable EAXS file(s) into an Archival Information Package.

The deliverable version of the EAXS file is meant to contain email messages that have tagged by Name Entity Recognition (NER) tools to facilitate archival processing and eventually discovery.

The information package contents will contain not only the EAXS file(s), but also a [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/mets-home.html) file, message attachments, statistical information, and other relevant data.

...

TOMES tool is under active development by the [State Archives of North Carolina](http://archives.ncdcr.gov/) in conjunction with the [TOMES project team](https://www.ncdcr.gov/resources/records-management/tomes/team).
