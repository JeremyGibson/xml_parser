The North Carolina Wage and Hour Act covers benefits but because of the Federal ERISA law, much of the coverage for severance has been lost.  If the company has a written severance policy, you will need to contact the US Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration in Atlanta (1-866-444-3272) or <http://www.dol.gov/ebsa>http://www.dol.gov/ebsa .  If the company does not have a written plan but the Employee was verbally told of a plan (ie:  help us finish moving the equipment out and we will give you an additional week’s pay), then this type of severance promise is covered by our law.  If you have questions on this, please call me at 1-919-807-2808.

The Wage and Hour Act does not regulate what hours or the number of hours an Employer can assign to individual Employees.  Therefore, the Employer can set the work week for any amount of time.  If as in your case, the Employer chooses not to employ Employees on weekends, there is no requirement that the Employer allow you to work on weekends.  If you are working and the Employer has knowledge of the work, then those hours are considered work time and the Employee must be compensated for those hours.  The Employer must do what is financially possible for the company to survive.  If funding is not available to pay for Saturday and Sunday hours, then the Employer can choose not to operate on those days.  If you are working for the State of North Carolina or if you are working with Medicare/Medicaid funding, you would need to contact you senator or representative to get more funding appropriated.  If you have questions, please call me.  919-807-2808.

(For the Honoray Governor Bev Perdue)
I work for the health care system, assisting disabled adults with everyday living. I do appreciate my job, but I have concerns. I get paid for most weekdays, and get holidays and weekends off. But, my client still needs care on these days. On my non-paid days, I use my own resources to make sure my client is cared for. With all due respect, I am requesting for myself and others like me to be paid for all the days that we do work for our clients.

Thanks for your time.

Mr. Garrett,



                Your e-mail to the Governor was forwarded to my office at the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division.   The issues you are pursuing deal with your termination and unemployment.  The Wage and Hour Act does not deal with the hiring or firing of Employees but rather the collection of earned wages.  North Carolina is a right to work state and that means that an Employee can be terminated at any time for any reason.   In fact, the Employer does not have to give you a reason.  If you file for unemployment, the Employer would have to state a reason or allow you to draw unemployment against his account if you are eligible.  So, as far as your termination is concerned, we cannot help.  Your unemployment would be a matter to be handled by your local Employment Security Commission.  If you are not getting a reasonable response from the person you are dealing with there, you may need to contact their boss or that location’s manager.  I hope that this will clarify the issue.

Subject: Help my family please

Comment: I lost my job about 6 weeks ago and I have no money. I have two kids car payment and house payment. I was fired from my job and I never got a reason why from my employer. I did get wrote up in the first month of employment for a mechanical error on my part. I took full responsibility for my error. I worked about two months at this company before they let me go. About 6 weeks ago I applied for unemployment insurance. I have had no response from them. I do not understand. I have applied for over 50 jobs within a 50 mile radius. I have had no luck. I need some money. My insurance benefits say I have around 11,000+- available. I have a stellar work history and I have never been wrote up or fired from any job in my whole life and I have papers to prove it. Like I said I only worked there for 2 months+-. I think that I was shafted. I feel like I got myself into a job with poor management. While I was working there I found out that my supervisors were dating and one of them was married. I have a feeling that my knowledge of this info cost my my job. Please help me and my family get the benefits that we deserve. I am having a hard time getting food-stamps also. I do not understand why a person that works hard his entire life cannot get the help that he needs but a people that do not choose to work or illegal immigrants can get these benefits there whole life?

This is probably a federal funding issue through Medicaid/Medicare.  I would check with you US Senator and Representative to start.  If they would not help, you could try your NC Senator or Representative.

Dear Mr. Morrow,

I have worked for two companies so far, and this is what I am hearing:

"We are only allowed to give you 45 hours per month per customer."  This sounds as if it is out of the company's hands.  That's why I contacted Governor Perdue's office.  Who is the person I contact as far as funding?

Thanks.

Your concerns was forwarded to my office by the Governor’s office. 



The issue of severance pay is not handled by the Wage and Hour Act except on a very limited basis.  The complaint you have for severance will need to be addressed by the US Department of Labor out of Atlanta.  They enforce the IRESA Law which deals with large corporation severance policies, pensions, retirement and other benefits.  They may be contacted at:



US Department of Labor

The asbestos issue will most likely need to be handled by a private attorney.



I hope this will help with your situation.

Dear Gov. Perdue

            My name is Pamela Foxx, I am a 55 year old single woman that is one of your constituent I am proud to say that I have written to you on more than one occasions and have always gotten positive and timely responses from you.

However, when I wrote to you in the past, I was usually voicing my concerns about a particular bill that I felt strongly about or some injustice I felt needed to be addressed, but this time I'm afraid that the injustice is directly affecting me and my former co-workers.



            I am not sure that this is the office to which I should be passing on my concerns about this matter, but because of the auspicious responses I have gotten from your office in the past, I felt that your office would be a good place to start. I am positive that I will at least be steered in the right direction by starting with you, because of my past experiences.



            My situation is as follows: I was employed at Continental General Tire in Charlotte, North Carolina for 22 years before the job was outsourced to Brazil, and I was laid off May of 2006. After being laid off I, along with other fellow employees was given the opportunity to go back to school for retraining to enhance our chances of obtaining comparable employment under the WIA program, which, I felt was a remarkable opportunity. However, as I stated earlier, I was vested in that company for 22 years and was told that in order not to lose my severance pay, I had to stay on the “Call back” list for an additional 2 years, which essentially tied me to the company for 24 years before my obligations to the company was terminated without reprisals. Although I was laid off with the understanding that severance pay would follow the lay off to help with the transition after my years of service to the company, I am now rapidly approaching my 3rd year of lay-off with no sign of ever receiving any severance pay.



            This is more than just a passing concern to me because now the funds that I was receiving through the WIA program and unemployment has depleted. I am now in an immediate danger of losing my home. I followed the rules that were set for me upon being laid off, and made what I felt to be a worthwhile career choice that was available to me for the 2 years training offered by the program.  I worked hard although I had not been inside a classroom for more than 35 years, and have only one more semester left before finishing with a GPA of 3.3. But the prospect for finding a job with no previous experience in my Major, with so many experienced people looking for work in that same field, leaves me with low expectations.



            In addition to the situation already mentioned is the fact many of us have also been diagnosed with asbestos poisoning which is a direct result to exposure to asbestos inside the plant. Without a job I cannot afford insurance. And I am finding out that there is a lot more of my co-workers that are in the very same situation, which leads me to believe that , this is part of Continentals grim plan, which is to wait to see how many of us will die before they have to pay us any severance pay at all. Which works for them but sucks for me: The program that I went to school under did not allow for working while you were in the program. And I was receiving a better income under that program than I would have had I decided

to discontinue it and seek employment elsewhere as an unskilled employee. So this made staying in college and finishing the course a must. The problem developed when, the funds were cut off abruptly before the classes were completed, which left no time for finding a job between finishing the class and seeking employment. And this made my situation ominous.



            Continental Tire needs to come through with their contractual obligation of paying the severance pay that is owed to us, after so many years of loyal service. Maybe with the dire times ahead of us, this will at least keep us afloat until we can obtain employment elsewhere.



            Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and a speedy response from you will be highly appreciated, as my situation is extremely time sensitive.



Sincerely,



Pamela Foxx

Visitor: Mr. Bill Vosburg

Address: 3232 Neuse Banks Court, Wake Forest, NC 27687

Email: wevosburg@yahoo.com

Subject: Rights and Support

Comment: I would like to see what rights myself as well as many other employees that were to be provided severance packages from are previous company Nortel Networks. For myself I received a severance package from Nortel on December 11th 2008. I was to be an employee of Nortel Networks thru Febuary 9th 2009 and as of Febuary 9th 2009 I as well as many other terminated employees were to receive a Severance package. I should have received Medical Benefits thru the End of Septmeber 2009. My questions are what rights do we have and support from the North Carolina Gov. This is money that I was going to use to support my family! And lost tax dollars to the State and Federal Goverment. I truly hate the Word Chapter 11 Bankrupty Protection. All the groups I have attempted to talk with at the State and Federal levels of Gov. toss yourself like a Hot Potatoe. This has also Impacted Employees Pension Plans. For myself I was going to pull my Pension to support my family. The Day that Nortel Networks went into Bankruptcy Protection they changed there Rule. On 12/15/2008 I had the company send myself my Pension statement. I had the option of receiving a Lump Sum, rolling money to an IRA or taking monthly pension. With the Bankruptcy Protection we have given Companies a Golden Umbrella as well as CEO from these companies. Myself and many others are looking for help and answers. What rights do we have?

How Employers treat their Employees is up to the company except for discrimination.  The discrimination that is illegal is based on age, race, sex, religion, national origin, handicap or color.   The fact that the Employer does not like you (and therefore treats you worse that other Employees) is not illegal.  If the Employer wants to treat the office staff one way and the production staff differently, that is not illegal.  However, if the office staff is all female and the production staff is all male, then there might be a sex discrimination issue.  Or, if the Employees of department A are all minorities and the Employees of department B are all white there could be a race issue.  But if the Employer just likes one group of Employees better than another group and therefore treats them better, this is not illegal.  It may be unfair, but it is not illegal.  It is the Employer’s business and he/she can run it the way they want to.  How the Employer treats the Employees is up to the company as long as the Employer does not violate the rights of Employees based on the protected areas.  It is not illegal to be a poor manager and it is not illegal to find another job if you have a poor manager.  Employee treatment is an issue that is also dealt with by labor unions.

Under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, there are no laws requiring breaks for any Employees age 16 and older.  Therefore, anyone 16 years old and older could be worked 24 hours per day, 7 days per week provided the Employer pays the proper wage (Minimum Wage or more) and Overtime.   Most Employers have found that they get more work and better work from Employees that get breaks, but the breaks are not required by law.  Also, there are no maximum hour laws for Employees over 16.  Years ago, Employees could only work 56 hours per week, but due to complaints by Employees who wanted to work more than 56 hours per week, that law was repealed back in the 70’s or early 80’s.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Dear Mrs. McCallum:



Your inquiry to the Governor’s office was forwarded to my office for assistance.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act once a bankruptcy has been filed.  The bankruptcy laws supersede the Wage and Hour Act.  The bankruptcy court takes control of all assets and disburses money according to a predetermined schedule for creditors.  You will have to contact the bankruptcy for any possible relief. 



You might also want to contact the US Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration.  They deal with pensions, retirements, medical benefits etc. and their ERISA law may offer some help.  They can be contacted at 1-866-444-3272, or 601 Forsyth St., SW, Room 7B54, Atlanta, GA  30303, or www.dol.gov/ebsa.

Subject: Nortel Bankruptcy

Comment: Nortel has seized all severance and medical benefits for employees who were given severance pacakges and DID NOT NOTIFY the employees impacted by this change. We had to hear it on the news. My husband worked for 27 years at Nortel and was given notice November 18th, 2008 at which time he signed an agreement with Nortel for severance and medical benefits until August 2009. He called Nortel HR services after hearing about the bankruptcy on the local news only to be informed his last paycheck would be this Friday. How can they treat employees in such an unethical manner. We had no warning and now we will loose everything we have worked so hard for over the years. It is incomprehensible that a corporation as large as Nortel would treat employees in such a unethical manner. We pray Governor Perdue will challenge this unfair practice and inquire as to how and why Nortel would stoop to such a low level. Please help us! Thank you!

Mr. Vidal:



Your inquiry was transferred to the Wage and Hour Bureau which enforces the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act.  Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done for you under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act.  The North Carolina Wage and Hour Act does not control hiring or firing.  The Employer is free to hire and fire in any way he/she feels is appropriate for the business.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission handles complaints on hiring and firing as they relate to discrimination due to age, race, sex, religion, national origin, handicap and color.  As far as the no compete clause, that is something you would need to take up with a private attorney.  Some no compete clauses are legal and some are not.  It will all depend on the circumstances of each case.

Subject: labor laws

Comment: State and Federal laws are inhibiting my chances of gaining a second job due to Non-Solicitation and company imposed ethics policies. I work for a large communications company in the Data Networking arena. Combining the economy with company layoffs makes it easy to realize that I should take action before the state of things impose financial strain on my house hold. Basically, get another job to offset the "trouble". As it stands right now, if my primary employer finds out that I am working for someone else int the same field, I would most likely be fired. I dont want to sit back and watch as my financial life crumbles around me. I make a good salary but my job is at risk now more then ever. I am paying on 2 new cars, 1 camper, 1 motorcycle and my mortgage. All on time and my credit is impeccable. I am one who is paying for those who do / did not have foresight. I have no problem working harder to keep what I have, legally. AN EMPLOYER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIRE ME OR INHIBIT MY ABILITY TO MAKE MORE MONEY. ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES.THIS HAS TO CHANGE !!!!! Christopher Vidal vidalch_1@yahoo.com

If your total pay for all hours (including waiting time and meetings) is the Minimum Wage  ($6.55) or more, then the Employer is OK for Minimum Wage.  If your rate of pay for all hours (including waiting and meetings) is not at least 1 ½ times the Minimum Wage for all hours worked, there could be an Overtime problem.   If you still have questions, please contact our office at 1-800-NCLABOR.

Email: selenasdp@yahoo.com

Subject: 100% commission based pay and uncompensated employer time demands

Comment: I work for a pest control company as a service tech. I have a route of customers. I am paid 100% on commission. We are told to report to the office at 7am every morning no matter what time our appointments start and again before 4:00 each day to turn in work completed for the day. Several Tuesday mornings each month there is a mandatory meeting that last approx. 1 hour. This time is not compensated to us in misc. hourly rate, nor is any time during other meetings or functions during our production work day. Also my supervisor will from time to time instruct me to wait at the office until he returns before I can continue my daily work or if finished, go home for the day. There have been times of hours that I had to just sit and wait. That time was never compensated in any way. Is this a violation of any labor law for the uncompensated time, and can an employer dictate hourly time constraints on you if you are paid strictly on commission? I enjoy my job very much but the working environment at the office just feels like a double standard of control vs. pay. I would very much like to know if this is legal activity or not and what can be done if it is in fact, not following NC state guidelines. If it is legal practice, I apologize for my ignorance of the law but thank you in advance for your response. Thank you, Selena Ursery
