	Message: 	I wanted to write to you to express my concern about the funding problems affecting NC schools. I have 2 sons who attend Cove Creek Elementary School in Vilas, NC. The school population is around 300. At a recent Parent Advisory meeting, I found out that due to economic/budget problems, NC schools are required to send back to Raleigh a portion of each individual school's budget-I believe Cove Creek is required to send back over $2,000. My complaint about this is why is there a school bud get problem in our state when the NC "EDUCATION" Lottery is making money hand over fist? If the money made from the "Education" lottery is not going to the schools, then at least the name of the lottery should be changed to reflect where exactly the money is going. I support the use of a lottery in NC as long as the money made from it is going to Education-thus the name of the lottery-NC Education Lottery. I certainly hope Gov. Perdue prioritizes spending in a fashion that reflects the importance of our children as the greatest resource and asset this state has. I do understand that during these rough economic times some tough decisions need to be made, but asking schools to send money back to Raleigh, when millions are being made through an entity with a misleading title like the NC "Education" Lottery, is bordering on fraudulent. Governor Perdue, we elected you to make changes in our state government that will benefit all the people of NC which in cludes our children. Please do the right thing and make sure any budget cuts the state has to make are done in areas that do not affect our schools and children-the funding for them is in short supply as it is, let alone asking them to give up more. Thank you for your consideration and I wish you the very best in your upcoming term as our state Governor.

	Message: 	Dear Governor Perdue:



While I realize that it must be an extremely busy time for you between the upcoming Inauguration of President Obama and dealing with the economic crisis, I need your help.



The Navy’s Notice of Intent (NOI) published in the Federal Register on April, 9, 2008, stated the Navy was only terminating the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Introduction of F/A-18E/F (Super Hornet) Aircraft to the East Coast of the United States (http://www.olfeis.com/documents/FR%20Notice%209%20APR%2008.pdf).



I would like for you to ask the Navy a question for me: Is the 2003 Final Environmental Impact Study (FEIS) considered by the Navy to be a historical document? According to the Navy’s OLF website (www.olfeis.com/historic.aspx), the 2003 FEIS has been relegated to historic document status. According to the NOI published in the Federal Register, only the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was terminated by the Navy..



If the 2003 FEIS was not terminated then it should not be listed on the Navy’s website as “historic” in nature. This constitutes a violation of our rights under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in that valid data is being misrepresented as “historic” and thus invalid. We contend that data published by the Navy in the 2003 FEIS proves that an additional OLF is not required. In fact, the Navy reached the same conclusion in the 2003 FEIS that an additional OLF was not required when it selected preferred Alternative 6 in its Record of Decision dated September 2003. None of the Super Hornet homebasing alternatives (including the preferred Alternative 6) requires an additional OLF according to page 12-1 of the 2003 FEIS (http://www.olfeis.com/documents/FEIS/FEIS.pdf).



If the 2003 FEIS was terminated along with the DEIS then there is no basis for the Navy’s search for an additional OLF. The only remaining basis for the search would be the Navy’s need-based statement in the NOI that training requirements for NAS Oceana and NS Norfolk-based aircraft “can exceed NALF Fentress capacity up to 63% of the time during summertime when hours of darkness are limited.” Incidentally, the Navy has not provided any operational data or calculations to support the 63% over capacity statement found in the NOI.



Therefore, we ask that you implore the Secretary of the Navy to provide prompt answers to the following questions:



1. Is the 2003 Final Environmental Impact Study (FEIS) for the Introduction of F/A-18-E/F (Super Hornet) Aircraft to the East Coast of the United States considered by the Navy to be a “historic document” as specified on their OLF web page?

2. Has the 2003 FEIS been terminated or rendered invalid in any way by the Navy?

3. If the 2003 FEIS has been terminated or rendered invalid or historic, what forms the basis for the current OLF study?

4. What is the basis for the Navy’s statement in the Notice of Intent that “Fentress is over capacity up to 63% of the time during summertime when hours of darkness are limited”?

5. Please provide all aircraft training operational requirements that support the Navy’s statement in the NOI that Fentress is over capacity “up to 63% of the time during summertime when hours of darkness are limited.” This should include training requirements for all squadrons associated with carrier air wings based at Oceana and at NAS Norfolk and should include nighttime AND darkness training requirements for said squadrons as well as an analysis of other available Department of Defense runway assets on the East Coast including Oceana.

6. If Fentress is over capacity “up to 63% of the time during summertime when hours of darkness are limited,” has the Navy performed any studies of all other East Coast Department of Defense runway assets (including Oceana) outlining their capability/availability to absorb any training requirement overflows during such over capacity periods? Did the Navy consider performing any such study prior to coming to the conclusion that the acquisition of additional real estate (the proposed 2nd OLF site) was desirable?



We need to know the answers to these questions as soon as possible because of the Navy’s continued study of the Hales Lake OLF Project. Thank your for your prompt attention to this matter.



Sincerely,

Richard N Staples

	Message: 	Gov. Perdue first of all congratulations. I am a landlord in Raleigh I have five houses and I'm currently selling one off and will have to seal more off. Below is a letter I wrote to the Commissioner of banks. Wells Fargo and countrywide two of the mortgage companies that hold some of my mortgages. The mortgage companies are using a coined phrase"real estate investors"to place all of us that owned investment property in the same category. They refuse to give us lower competitive rates no t because of the risk factor. But because they think we have more money and can pay it. Rents in Raleigh are in most cases identical or higher the mortgage payments. We are hardly making any money and are also looking forward to know appreciation and even maybe depreciation are property. This is a con game. Please read the letter below

First of all I would like to thank Rebecca 800-405-0078 extension 3110. Also I would like to thank Janell 800-399-1762 extension 5277. For their help

My name is John Harrison and I am a landlord in Raleigh. I have been a landlord for 15 years Ten of which was in California. At the present time I have five properties in North Carolina. Over a 15 year time span I have had probably eight properties and I have never paid a mortgage late. Ever. My mortgage companies now are Wells Fargo and countrywide. In California they were downy Savings and Loan and Calbay mortgage.

Mortgage companies are suppose to charge an interest rate that reflects the risk factor of the owner. I believe it is unfair to me to be paying close to 7% on some of my properties. Then a new unproven buyer comes to the market and gets a 5% rate. Even though this may be a single-family home buyer. The mortgage companies classify us all in one category as owners of investment property and therefore more risky.

Of course they know this is not true but they can get away with it. Would you rather sell a house to a person that has been in business 15 years and never paid late even though paying on up to five properties at one time or would you rather have a person hold your mortgage that is a first time buyer. If the mortgage companies really looked on us as being more risky they would be doing everything they can to get us lower rates in these unusual times.

Mortgage companies have been extended a lifeline by our tax money because of the circumstances of families having problems paying their mortgage. I ask you what is the difference nowadays between a mortgage payment and a rent payment. At least in North Carolina there is no difference. So we as landlords are having to struggle to. It is more difficult to collect rent because families are low on money and also one of the reasons we have purchased investment property is for appreciation which is not happening now and even in some cases there is depreciation.

The mortgage companies are treating investors like this not because it's right or it reflects any risk factor. But because they can. Just as a person with a weapon can walk up to you and Rob you.
I have written to the Commissioner of banks and to the governor and I will resubmit a complaint to the Commissioner of banks and to the new governor of North Carolina.

I have tried to communicate this problem with two apartment associations in the triangle area in order to get numbers behind this complaint. They were unresponsive. I believe that they have been so unresponsive because they are not only landlords but real estate professionals. And as real estate professionals they do not want the public to know what landlords are going through. This would mean they would be cutting himself off from selling to investors. However there is a new meet up group that is only landlords and not real estate investors which I will meet with in two weeks.

Also I am in the process of selling one of my houses and talk to a real estate agent today about putting another one on the market. This will give you the mortgage company the chance to test your theory about
me being risky. Because chances are that you will end up carrying the mortgage because Wells Fargo and countrywide are the only ones in Raleigh about that are carrying mortgages. The new family that buys a house will have less equity in the house then I have. Also IThis means you would trade me in for probably a first time unproven buyer which you will give them 5% on an amount that is more then what I owed because they probably won't be able to put down the deposit that I put down. When you could have just given the lower rate to me.
I am also going to a share my experience with the new meet up group.
