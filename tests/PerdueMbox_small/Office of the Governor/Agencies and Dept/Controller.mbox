Subject: Health Care Employee Comp. System

Comment: Dear Gov.Pudue: Congratulations to you on your win in the general elections and being sworne in as Governor of our state of North Carolina! My name is Bobby Rauf. I am former 1st Vice Chair of Cleveland County Democratic party and a proud supporter of your bid for the office of Governor for North Carolina. We will continue to root for you and support you in Cleveland County and we wish you best of luck. I would like to bring an important issue to your attention as you assume your duties as our Governor. This issue has to do with implementation of the Beacon Compensation Program being enforced by the current Controller reporting to Governor Easley. Under the program being enforced by the current Controller, Physicians working in our State Hospitals, such as Cherry Hospital, are NOT being compensated fairly for the overtime worked by the physicians. These physicians and the hospital management have already petition and brought the matter to controller’s attention, but in vain. As you take on the governance of our state, your investigation and attention into this matter would be greatly appreciated by state health care providers and the patients who need the care so critically. Thanks, in advance, for your time and attention in this matter. Bobby Rauf (336) 596-3826 129 Camille Drive Shelby, NC 28150

David – This issue was handled by telephone, and Mr. Rauf is pleased with the outcome which I have outlined below.  Since Mr. Raub’s email did not include specifics on who he was talking about, telephonic communication was more beneficial than an email response to him.



Action Taken:



·         Herb Henderson contacted Mr. Rauf and obtained the following information:

o   Mr. Rauf’s brother is a doctor at Cherry Hospital who believes that he has been “shorted” approximately $30,000 of overtime.  Herb and I think this is probably related to leave offsetting, but can determine more after we get more information.

o   Herb told Mr. Rauf that the most efficient way for us to investigate the situation would be for us to contact his brother ourselves.  Mr. Rauf thought this was a good idea and provided his name and contact information.



Next steps:



·         Herb will have his staff prepare a spreadsheet that shows the history of his pay.

·         Herb will contact DHHS HR and tell them about the issue, then they will determine whether DHHS HR or our shop will contact the doctor.



Mr. Rauf was very pleased with the conversation with Herb.  We will continue to work on the brother’s issue, but  we believe this is sufficient information to close the outstanding “ticket” with the Governor’s office.  Please let me know if you would like additional information.

Dear Ms. Gooding:



Governor Perdue has received your recent email question regarding the BEACON system.  She has asked me to respond on her behalf. 



You asked “Was there a need for the BEACON system?  What was wrong with the former system?”



Since the system the state was using prior to BEACON was more than 20 years old and had limited capabilities, there was a significant need for an updated system.  The previous systems were at risk of failure due to old age and withdrawal of vendor support. 



We are working very hard to eliminate payroll and leave issues that have arisen with the BEACON system.   Several system fixes were put into production over the last week that will correct some issues that have occurred recently. 



In addition, I have been tasked as the State Employee and Agency Relations Coordinator to assist with specific concerns from state employees and agencies.  If you have specific concerns about your pay or leave balances, you can contact BEST Shared Services at

866-622-3784.  You are also welcome to contact me, and I will be happy to assist in any way I can.



Sincerely,

Claire Ennis

Dear Mr. Dolinger



Governor Perdue has received your recent email.  She has asked me to respond on her behalf. 



It is correct that during this past pay period some state employees were notified that money was being taken out of their checks for instances where they were overpaid.  State Controller, David McCoy, has asked each agency to work with individuals in this situation to advance funds and set up a repayment plan that will not cause undue hardship.  Any employee in this situation should contact their HR rep for advanced funds and to set up a repayment plan.



We appreciate your sharing your concerns with us.  If you have further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My information is below.

Comment: Governor Perdue I am a state employee who works for Department of administration. This passed pay period there were people in DOA that were told that they were having money takin out of there checks or in some cases not getting one because BRACON had made mistakes over the last 12 months and over paid them. My question to you is why do the people have to pay it back all at once it was not taken out all at once. These people depend on there pay to pay thier debts, and buy food for them and their families. Please check in to this matter thank you Adam Dolinger

Subject: Beacon Payroll System

Comment: Dear Honorable Purdue, I wanted to share that when the Beacon Payroll system was put in place, I, a worker for the state for over 25 years and a dual state employee since July 1, 1999, has been made to stop working my part-time employment losing approximately $12000 of income per year and the state losing the taxes that would be paid on this. This system has affected many dual employees. Beacon went live for our departments April 1, 2008 and the Office of State Personnel has still not decided if they need to pay us for 2 years of retro overtime pay of which they say they do for any hours combined over 40 between the two jobs. I believe the state should allow employees to work dual if they are willing to sign a waiver exempting them of overtime pay; however, the OSP can't seem to figure out how to account for this in the Beacon system. If there is anything the Governor's office can do to encourage the OSP and Beacon to resolve these issues and pay those who have worked hard and anticipating dual overtime pay, please do so. The employees who have worked for the state as dual would greatly appreciate any assistance as this has gone on now for over nine months with very little encouragement that they are close to resolving. Sincerely, Lt. Terry Bryant NC State Fairgrounds and Special Events Coordinator NC Aquarium at Fort Fisher

Hi Kelley – We investigated and found out that the personnel tech at his facility changed his work schedule on Feb 3  from  Night Shift to Day Shift effective back to 9/1/08. The night shift and evening shift premiums that were paid to him from September through January 09 have been taken back as a result of this change. We are contacting Mr. Novack to explain and confirm that his shift did change. 



Since we’re contacting him by telephone, this email can close this one out.  Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: Beacon system, Help

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, Thank you for taking the time to hear the plea of the working class. I am writing you today because of the state beacon system that made an error on my pay and over payed me and now it's going to take back over $4,0000 at one time. That's right no pay check. I'm a state employee, RN at JFK ADATC and I have asked for answers but the only reply is that beacon does it own thing. This does not harbor a sense of security for me or my family. I am not the only one with this problem, others are being underpaid. I and my family will survive this considering that we have put some funds away encase something like this happened but many do not have this back up. This system (Beacon) is ruining family's and with this economy it will not take much. We hear that they are improving the system but we still see our pay and benefits being short changed. I feel that this matter needs careful review of the harm that continuing this program can and is causing. Thank you again for you attention on this matter. Christopher A. Novack, RN
