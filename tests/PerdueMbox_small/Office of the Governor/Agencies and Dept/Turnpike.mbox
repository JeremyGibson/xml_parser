Mr. Eason:

I am in receipt of your January 24, 2009 email to the governor’s office regarding air quality concerns relating to the Monroe Connector/Bypass and Gaston East-West Connector projects, both of which are being studied by the North Carolina Turnpike Authority (NCTA) as potential toll roads.

In your email you raised numerous issues with respect to several air quality pollutants, especially particulate matter and mobile source air toxics. Your questions are similar to those mentioned in previous correspondence to NCTA, specifically in your email dated August 7, 2007 (attached) and two letters dated October 2, 2007 (attached) and November 13, 2007 (attached). NCTA responded to your email and letters in correspondence dated September 20, 2007 (attached) and November 21, 2007 (attached).

NCTA’s November 21st letter to you stated that an air quality assessment was underway and that the results would be disclosed in a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) that would be available for public review and comment. Until the Draft EIS is completed and released to the public, it would be premature to discuss specific elements of the air quality assessment at this time. NCTA’s letter further stated that the Draft EIS for the Monroe Connector/Bypass was scheduled to be completed in July 2008. Please note that the current schedule has the Draft EIS being completed in March 2009. The Draft EIS for the Gaston East-West Connector is also scheduled for completion in March 2009. The Draft EIS for both projects will be widely distributed to the public through NCTA’s website as well as local libraries and local government offices. A mailing announcing the availability of the Draft EIS’s will also be mailed to everyone on the mailing list, including yourself. NCTA will ensure that considerable opportunity is provided to the public for review and comment on the Draft EIS’s and NCTA looks forward to receiving your comments at that time. NCTA will provide a response to all comments received during the public comment period.

Please note that all studies will be conducted in conformance with federal and state air quality laws, regulations and guidance, including those of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Highway Administration and the NC Department of Transportation.

Your comments have been added to the project record and your name is on the mailing list for both projects. Please contact me at (919) 571-3000 or <blocked::mailto:jennifer.harris@ncturnpike.org>jennifer.harris@ncturnpike.org if I may be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Harris

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mr. Ed Eason

Address: 601 Butternut Ln, Matthews, NC 28104

Email: EdE@carolina.rr.com

Subject: Transportation/Air Quality Concerns

Comment: Governor Purdue, The following letter was sent as a copy to Gov. Mike Easley concerning the Monroe Bypass and Gaston East/West Connector. To date, Stallings Elementary School is constructed and within a few hundred feet of a proposed intersection (One of two options)of the Monroe Bypass. I really did not receive an adequate response from the NCTA concerning this matter. I have other scientific research articles I can share with you, if you are interested. I am concerned for the health of the children attending this school if they construct the Highway within close proximity to the school. Thank You Ed Eason Ms. Jennifer Harris, P.E. November 12, 2007 North Carolina Turnpike Authority Re: Monroe Connector/Bypass & the Gaston East-West Connector I have some questions and comments concerning the air quality impacts with the proposed Monroe Bypass/Connector and the Gaston East-West Connector. Please answer these questions and add these comments to the public record. 1. I understand that Union and Mecklenburg Counties are currently in attainment for PM2.5, but to my knowledge, Union has no monitor for PM2.5 while Mecklenburg’s annual standard is currently 14.9µg/m3. I believe you mentioned the annual standard for non-attainment is 15.0µg/m3 and above. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) projects that the trucking industry will be responsible for a 75 % increase in freight tonnage by 2020, and the proposed intermodal facility at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and expansions at the ports will substantially increase truck traffic on the proposed freeways. As a result, the diesel particulate matter and exhaust organic gases will be closer to existing and already planned homes and schools, etc. (sensitive receptors). Why are the FHWA and NCTA not conducting a computer model assessment for PM2.5 and diesel organic gases? Citizens have a right to know if the additional traffic will increase these pollutants at the project level and for probable non-attainment for PM2.5 in the future. The Gauderman et al study in the journal Lancet found that elevated PM2.5 levels were found up to 1500 feet from major roadways. 2. The Federal Highway Administration’s interim guidance on Mobile Source Air Toxics is highly suppositious, based primarily on surmise rather than adequate scientific evidence. If known human health hazard prevention were a priority, the same unknowns the FHWA points out quite nicely in their prepared Environmental Impact Statements as to why they cannot do a comprehensive MSATs (Mobile Source Air Toxins) analysis at the project level in order to quantify the cancer and non-cancer risks should be enough reason to avoid schools and residential areas altogether. The EPA found that a substantial number of modeling assessment and air quality monitoring studies show elevated concentrations of multiple (MSATs) in close proximity to major roads. The 6 priority MSATs out of a total of 177 are: Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Benzene,1,3-Butadiene, Diesel Particulate Matter & Diesel Exhaust Organic Gases, and Formaldehyde. I understand that there will be a proposed 30% reduction in MSATs from 40 CFR parts 59, 80, 85, and 86 due to cleaner fuels and vehicles by 2030. While this action by the EPA is applauded, the results will not be immediately realized in 2015 due to the expected delay for a complete fuel program phase-in and the immediate purchase of all new clean vehicles is unlikely, which means most of the projected reductions will probably occur closer to 2030. Let’s assume the reductions of gasoline (on-road mobile sources) will be met (a total of 371 million pounds in 2020 and 606 million pounds of MSATs in 2030 reduced); there will still be 558,666 tons in 2015, and 507,782 tons in 2020 and 505,074 tons of MSATs in 2030 emitted to the atmosphere in the US on a yearly basis according to the EPA. This equates to over one billion pounds of on-road MSATs per year still emitted to the atmosphere. The EPA should set a minimum standard for at least the 6 priority MSATs, and they should be included in the transportation conformity process under Title 40 CFR part 51 and 93. Other than pointing out the accomplishments and deficiencies of the EPA, what actions if any are the FHWA and the NCTA going to take to reduce the exposure to citizens who live within close proximity to the proposed freeways? Will the NCTA purchase a 2300 foot total right of way? Will the FHWA, and by extension the NCTA, just continue to use 40 CFR 1502.22 a&b to opt out of doing a proper comprehensive risk assessment that will inform citizens of the risk and allow for sound decisions whether to move forward with a proposed highway in a specific area or not? 3. Comparing the impact of MSATs against different options (Existing Highway 74) within the study area is analogous to not seeing the forest for the trees, and this approach does not give an accurate representation to the impact on sensitive receptors at the project level. After you construct the new freeway, then you will have two major roadways with cumulative pollutants, and the new highway will be close to where large numbers of people reside. The comparison needs to be with the background ambient concentrations from actual monitors along the entire length of the proposed freeway(s). If monitors are not in place, they could easily be installed in the planning stage of the proposed freeway. When will the FHWA & NCTA contract to install monitors for PM2.5 and MSATs to accurately measure the background ambient concentrations for Options 18A, 21, 22A, 30, 34 etc.? Isn’t there 2 years until construction starts and 4 years thereafter until completion? Just in the area that includes Options 18A, 21, and 22A, there are approximately 23 residential subdivisions, and Lake Park has 781 housing units while Fairhaven will have approximately 400. NCTA indicated that Segment 5 was eliminated due to substantial potential impacts to the human environment and has a total of only 697 housing units. Segments 18A, 21, 22A, 30, and 34, etc. also are densely populated, but they do not have substantial impacts to business. Was minimizing the negative impact to businesses a priority for the NCTA in the screening process? The Alternatives Development and Analysis report failed to mention the number of housing units for the other subdivisions for segments 18A, 21, 22A, 30, & 34 etc. A thorough comprehensive analysis of the air quality impacts involving MSATs, PM2.5 and ozone formation to these residential areas must be conducted in order to determine the environmental constraints to comply with Federal and State statues including the NC Intrastate system. The State statute that prevents an existing roadway (Highway 74) to be tolled especially in an urban area should be reconsidered. Please address the probable congestion at the proposed interchanges at Sections 18A, 21, 22A & 30 that will occur due to existing inadequate roads, especially near Stallings Elementary School where parents will be dropping and picking up their children. According to the Gauderman et al study in the journal Lancet: “We have shown that residential distance from a freeway is associated with significant deficits in 8-year respiratory growth, which result in important deficits in lung function at age 18 years. This study adds to evidence that the present regulatory emphasis on regional air quality might need to be modified to include consideration of local variation in air pollution. In many urban areas, population growth is forcing the construction of housing tracts and schools near busy roadways (and vice versa), with the result that many children live and attend school in close proximity to major sources of air pollution. In view of the magnitude of the reported effects and the importance of lung function as a determinant of adult morbidity and mortality, reduction of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants could lead to substantial public-health benefits.” Please also explain in the DEIS how the MSATs, PM2.5 and other pollutants will not affect children at school. Obviously, the subdivisions between the existing 485 and option 18A are going to be impacted by both major freeways, and any DEIS will need to conduct an air quality modeling assessment to determine MSATs exposure levels as well. The FHWA can receive guidance from the EPA on monitoring, computer modeling, and pollutant exposure levels while the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry can provide Public Health consultations and assessments. 4. The latest assessment by the EPA estimates the excess risk of developing leukemia from inhalation exposure to benzene is as low as 2.2 to 7.8 x 10-6µg/m3. According to the National Cancer Institute, US National Institutes of Health, the estimated cases for 2007 are 44,240 new cases of leukemia resulting in 21,790 deaths. 78% of children get Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, approximately 218,659 people in the US currently are living with leukemia, and it causes more deaths than any other cancer among children under age 20. About 515 children under the age of 14 are expected to die from leukemia in 2007. Can anyone tell me how many of these unfortunate deaths are attributable to being exposed to benzene within close proximity to a major roadway? The EPA states: “Several studies have measured elevated concentrations of pollutants emitted directly by motor vehicles near roadways as compared to overall urban background levels. Pollutants measured with elevated concentrations include benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, black carbon, and coarse, fine, and ultra fine particulate matter. As described above, benzene and 1,3-butadiene are both known human leukemogens in adults. Evidence of adverse responses to traffic-related pollution is strongest for non-allergic respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular effects, premature adult mortality, and adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight and size. Some evidence for new onset asthma is available, but not all studies have significant correlations. As previously mentioned, there is evidence of increased risk of leukemia among children whose parents have been occupationally exposed to benzene. Though the near-roadway studies are equivocal, taken together with the laboratory studies and other exposure environments, the data suggest a potentially serious children’s health concern could exist. Additional research is needed to determine the significance.” Most research for the effects of benzene has only been conducted on adults, and little is known of the effects on children.

Ms. Harris,



Thank you for giving me a time frame when the draft environmental impact statements for the Monroe bypass/connector and Gaston east-west connector projects will be released.  Your response is similar to previous correspondence to me without really addressing my concerns.  Will the NCTA & Federal Highway Administration conduct a full quantitative MSAT analysis and disclosure to determine the impacts to schools, daycares, and hospitals etc. (sensitive receptors)?

Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific research articles studying near roadway exposures to vehicle pollutants indicate that it is a significant public health problem.  How can a road option be determined without a quantitative (MSAT) analysis?  Are these students destined for a shorter lifespan from cardiovascular damage and decreased lung function from fine (PM2.5) particulates, ozone, and at a higher risk for cancer from MSAT’s?  Under the National Environmental Policy Act, isn’t it a  requirement to disclose this information to the public?   The Federal Highway Administration’s interim guidance on Mobile Source Air Toxics is highly suppositious, based primarily on surmise rather than adequate scientific evidence.  Is NCTA going to conduct a detailed quantitative MSAT analysis following Section 202 of The Clean Air Act?  As you are aware, the EPA upgraded the Charlotte region’s non-attainment status for the 1997 ozone standard from moderate to serious or faced SIP disapproval and NCDAQ withdrew its State Implementation Plan for the Charlotte Metro area to the EPA.   Currently MUMPO and NCDOT are conducting a regional emission analysis, which probably will include eliminating road projects in order to conform to the SIP, and I suppose the transportation conformity process under Title 40 CFR part 51 and 93 as well.  Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to EPA for reconsideration of the annual level of the standard (which EPA left at 15 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3)) and reconsideration of the secondary PM2.5 NAAQS.  With respect to the annual PM2.5 NAAQS, the court held that the agency “failed to explain adequately why an annual level of 15 µg/m3 is ‘requisite to protect the public health,’ including the health of vulnerable subpopulations, while providing ‘an adequate margin of safety.’ 42 U.S.C.§ 7409(b)(1).”   The Charlotte Metro area may become a non-attainment area for fine particulate matter also, in the near future.
