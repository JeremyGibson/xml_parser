Kay,



Hope all is well. Just to update you, I have spoken with Mark Lemmon briefly

regarding his letter. He was recently admitted to the hospital and will re-contact me

when he is better. I did explain to him that I was calling him in response to the letter which

he sent Gov. Easley.



Best,

Deb:



Ms. Paden had filed a complaint with our office prior to contacting the Governor’s office and that is why this was not processed as a Governor referral.



Attached is our letter closing this file and a copy of the response letter sent directly to Ms. Paden from Wells Fargo (WF).



According to the response from WF a letter was forwarded to Ms. Paden on 04/06/2008 advising of the delinquency of the mortgage.  Also, proper notice was given on 4 occasions via certified mail to her HOA address and the property address.  Loan is due for 03/01/2008 - 08/01/2008 payments. 



Ms. Paden was informed that in order to review her loan for any workout options she needed to submit financial information for review.  Ms. Paden sent financial information but failed to provide proof of income.  She finally sent proof of income, but the foreclosure had already been completed and her request to rescind the foreclosure was denied. 



Per request of OCOB, the eviction process was delayed over the holiday season.  Ms. Paden plans to try to get proof that you supplied your income verification in a timely manner to WFHM and if she does we will revisit the complaint at that time.  Otherwise, her only option is to accept the Cash for Keys to vacate the property and avoid an eviction.

FYI……..



Good morning, Kay,



I have completed my research regarding Mrs. Zhou’s question. I looked in several places for requirements concerning bio-hazard bags including the US FDA, OSHA, NC Department of Health & Human Services-Division of Public Health, and the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources. With the help of Bill Patrakis at DENR, I was able to locate the NC Administrative Code that deals with these bags.



I called Mrs. Zhou this morning and walked her, screen by screen, through the DENR website to the information she needed. We also talked briefly about other services our office provides. She indicated Mandarin is her native tongue and I informed her we have a consultant who speaks Mandarin who can assist her if she would prefer.



Mrs. Zhou was very satisfied with the information we provided. I gave her our direct telephone number to contact us in the future with any additional questions.



Thank you,

Joe King

Dear Sir/Madam,



Our company has been a distributor of bio-hazard bags (a.k.a. red bags or medical waste bags) in Florida and plans to continue the business after relocating to North Carolina.



In Florida, our company has gone through rigorous approval process by submitting 3rd party test reports proving that our products meet the requirements of Florida Administrative Codes. For the past weeks,  we have searched through the state government's website, studied North Carolina Administrative Codes, and contacted Division of Waste Management, but have not been able to obtain any useful information.



As the last resort, I'm writing to you and hoping to find out which state government agency, if any, I should be working with in order to obtain approval for red bag distribution. I'd also appreciate a firm confirmation if such approval is not required in the state of North Carolina.



Look forward to hearing from you soon.



Sincerely,


Cherrie Zhou

I heard you say last night that the state has enough money to help 25,000 of the 50,000 that are losing there homes. How are we helping them? The Clinton Administration made the banks give the people loans that couldn't afford them! Why should we help people that took on more debt than they could afford? If the government was paying attention, they would have seen this coming. The regular middle class, tax payers are the ones that need the help. These people just need to cut there loss' and wake up to the real world. Pay their own ways, get up and go to work like the rest of us. If you have a family that is in a crisis (sickness, death, etc) by all means help them, but these are usually the ones that lose there homes and are put on the streets. Please explain to us how you plan to help?

Dear Mr. Lemmons:



The Office of Governor Beverly E. Perdue contacted the Office of the Commissioner of Banks and asked us to respond to your email inquiry regarding a refund of overcharges to Countrywide borrowers in North Carolina.



We have reviewed the refund list and do not find your name on the list to receive a refund.  Not all North Carolina borrowers are to receive a refund, only those who were overcharged on some sub-prime loans on primary residential loans occurring from October 2004 – October 2007.  Our investigation of Countrywide loans is complete and if we do not find your name on the list, there is no refund due to you.

I need information as I am positive that I have been overcharged by them. However, a phone conversation with them led to a plea of a lack of knownledge concerning this matter. I am trying to reduce my mortgage payment to them and this money could me tremendously. Please help me with this matter. Thank you' Mack Lemmons

Subject: Council on Tourism



Last year I was fortunate enough to attend the workshop in Winston-Salem and not only enjoyed the entire workshop, but was able to network and become acquainted with many of the representatives from various vendors in the state.  In some cases, they actually came to my classes and made presentations.  I also participated in the golf outing which raised money for the council's various activities.  This year, several of us would like to attend again but, due to budgetary cutbacks, we are not allowed to attend.  We use all of  the information we receive in our classes in order to create an awareness of the many splendors NC has to offer and possibly help develop a career path for some of our students. In many cases, our students, are looking to go to college in state and are undecided.  We are fortunate enough, through this exposure, to entice them to major in a Tourism or Hospitality field.  The other benefit is that through our course, more families stay together for vacations therefore, keeping the family time alive in NC.  Of course, by the traveling within the state allows them to sing the praises of the various sites to their relatives, friends and others.  

I was wondering if their were any grants available or money available that would pay for our hotel and registration at this year's workshop.  The five (5) of us would be more than happy to pay for our own food and transportation.

Deb,



We have already closed this complaint file.  Attached is the response from the company and our response.  Jennifer did process the complaint as she was directed to do.



According to the response, the account is past due for 159 days for $4,213.28 and foreclosure date is set for 01/09/2008.  This is the 3rd time Green Tree (GT) has had to initiate legal proceedings due to the delinquency of this account.  GT is willing to grant a deferral on this account if borrower can come up with $3,000 and her budget information by 12/26/2008.  Ms. Cole was provided a direct contact with GT to discuss payment arrangements.

Comment: I have been dealing with this situation for a while now. I have contacted my mortage holder and the governor's office and I cannot seem to get anybody that is really trying to help me. I had been out of work for two years and I finally got a job in mid November 2008. I contacted my mortage holder and asked them to work with me and lower my mortgage so I can afford my payments and they told me that they didn't do that. I have gone to Legal Aid, Credit Counseling, I have contacted I was contacted by Jennifer Winborne and I can't seem to get any direct assistance from her. All I want is for someone to help me to hold on to my home so I won;t be homeless. I'm only making nine dollars an hour until I can do better. I am in school full time. I have an Associates Degree in Accounting and I will have a Bachelors' in Business Administration in September. That does not help me right now. Please Help Me!!! I have a foreclosure hearing coming up in February. Thanks, Wanda Cole 870 Saulston Road Goldsboro, NC 27534 919 731-4448

Address: 4721 Old NC 11, Winterville, NC 28513

Email: jonj@greenvillenc.com

Subject: Bailout (Aid)

Comment: To Whom it may concern, My brothers and I own a small Machine Shop in Ayden, NC. Our business has been Inc. since 1970. Right now we employ eight people. At one time our shop employed over thirty. We are to the point now that we shut the doors or get some kind of aid/loan. It's just heartbreaking to me to see something my father started and something that has been part of my life, for most of my life end up failing. The state will have five families loose there jobs, Dreams and retirements when our shop closes it's doors. We understand better than most that the economy is bad. What we need is not a lot, but just something to get by with. So, what I'm asking for is an opportunity to come to Raleigh and talk with someone who will be able to help us. You can contact me @ 1-252-531-0060. Please respond to my request ASAP. Sincerely, Palle Justesen

Mr. Stewart,



On behalf of Governor Bev Perdue, I am respectfully responding to your e-mail inquiry of August 28, 2008 regarding your mother’s home.  In your message, you identified the location of your mother’s home as 2440 Melfield Drive, Haw River, N.C.   This home was submitted in the approved Alamance County’s 2007 Community Development Block Grant Scattered Sites Grant Application.



Presently, the houses submitted for rehabilitation under this grant are either underway or completed.  I am scheduled to review the sites including your mother’s home on Tuesday, January 27, 2009.  I can share more with you on Friday of next week about the status.  Unquestionably, the process is long, but I assure you that the county is working as quickly as possible to ensure that your mother has a safe, decent, and sanitary home. 



Again, I will contact you by e-mail next Friday.  I encourage you to write again should you have additional questions.



Sincerely,



Valerie

I sent an e-mail to you and never got to finish what I had to tell you. So now I have time to tell you what has been going on. As I said my husband Michael A. Clack was hurt at work and fired.
Now I need to tell you what is happening. George Culver of Applied Abatement Demolition dosen't carry worker's comp. He hires workers through he company, and to keep from getting into trouble he go his wife to get her own company, KAT Enviormential so he can loan his workers to her company; and she does have worker's comp. but if anyone gets hurt they will not file comp. Most of the workers are illegal aliens and they are made to work in asbestes ridden buildings. Also his employees work over 12 hours hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week. They are only paid for 40 hours and are forced to take straight pay for the rest in cash if they want to keep their job.
We are lossing everything. And we have to wait until Feb. 20,2009 for mediation at the lawyer's office.
LM Insurance Corporation has told us they don't work that way (not a dime since May). And we are tired of it all. Our house is in forclosier, tell us where are we going to live.
If you don't do something I will go to every newspaper. That's not a threat its a promise.

Dear Ms. Williams,



Governor Purdue has received your email and has asked the Department of Commerce to assist you. I am pleased to do so.  The state, unfortunately, does not have funds to help entrepreneurs with starting a new business.  Funding goes to community colleges and to the Small Business Technology Development Centers (SBTDC) to provide training and counseling. I suggest that you contact your local Small Business Center at the community college and the SBTDC via email (<http://www.sbtdc.org>www.sbtdc.org). By snail mail, I am sending you several brochures that we developed with the NC Rural Center to advise entrepreneurs. I hope these publications are helpful.



Sincerely,



Gail McDonald

Good morning Kay,



I spoke with Mr. Rice Tuesday the 27th via phone about the NC Green Business Fund and other funding opportunities.  In fact, I receive the following email from him the very same day:



RV,

I appreciate your time and advice on where to go to seek funding to start my business.  I will follow up with Chuck Sathrum at your suggestion.  To recap, the innovative product I have developed will provide the following benefits:

- Save homeowners money while improving their environment

- Reduce energy consumption

- Generate tax dollars for NC

- Employ NC workers – manufacturing, distribution, administration will all be based in NC



Regards,



Chris Rice

Office:704-544-8475

I told Mr. Rice that if any opportunities present themselves, I would personally contact him and let him know.  I also recommended that Mr. Rice visit The NC Green Business Fund web site (<http://www.ncscitech.com/gbf/>http://www.ncscitech.com/gbf/) and take a look at the NC Green Economic Resource Guide developed by Sara Day Evens with 21st Century Communities (CDA).

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue Office of the Governor 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue, Congratulations on your election. I am a supporter and look forward to better days under your leadership. I know that you are in support of building Green Business in NC and we all know how much we need to grow jobs. I am starting a company and am looking for federal and/or state assistance to launch a business that will: • Save homeowners & businesses money while improving the environment • Reduce energy consumption • Generate tax revenue for NC • Employ workers in NC for production and distribution of this product. The product I have developed is a simple, low tech solution to an existing problem that wastes energy everyday. This can truly make a difference, and I am seeking help to make this happen. I would like to know what is coming from the stimulus package that will help my business launch. What current programs are available immediately that could help? I would welcome the opportunity to become more involved in this area not only to help get my business up and running, but also to help other entrepreneurs starting green businesses in NC. If there is someone in your administration that is responsible for this development, please forward my information and have them contact me at their earliest convenience. I am motivated to action as I was recently severed from my position with my former employer. The timing is right on this business on all fronts.

Dear Mr. Cape,



Your question was forwarded to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks by the Governor’s Office for review and response. 



The Mortgage Lending Act applies to only owner-occupied primary residential property.  An option would be for you to contact your lending institutions to see if they would be willing to work with you to modify your loans.  The Home Protection Program (HPP) which is administered by the NC Housing Finance Agency offers bridge loans to qualified individuals; but, the HPP only applies to primary residential property.  Thank you for allowing our office the opportunity to respond to your issues. 



Sincerely,



The Office of the Commissioner of Banks

Email: epacje@gmail.com

Subject: financial / small business

Comment: I am happy you won as governor and am a supporter. I have a problem needing advice/referral: I have 6 rental properties in the Raleigh and Durham areas and live in Durham. I have rented these properties for 12 years. In this economy, I have seen a dramatic change in my ability to rent my houses. Also, my property taxes doubled or tripled in the last year. I cannot cover my mortgages, taxes and insurance with rents that consumers can afford, apparently. I am forced to sell in a terrible market. I have exhausted all savings. Is there any assistance for a bridge loan until one of my houses sells? Alternately, if my mortgage company would modify my rate (can no longer qualify) this would offset the rise in taxes. Is there any program that would aide me in modifying my existing mortgages? Foreclosures will result without assistance.

Dear Mr. Onorato,



Governor Purdue’s Office has received your email and has asked the Department of Commerce to assist you. Unfortunately, the state does not have the kind of bridge funding that you need. I often send clients to the Neuse River Development Authority because they do have funds to lend and some flexibility in using grants. Our state offerings only include training programs through the community college system at the Small Business Centers and the classes and counseling at the Small Business Technology Development Centers (SBTDCs). In Vanceboro, you should contact Robert Ericksen, Director of the SBC at Craven County Community College, <mailto:ericksenr@cravencc.edu>ericksenr@cravencc.edu; telephone: 252-633-5524 or the SBTDC in Greenville. Both these local agencies should be able to advise you of local sources of assistance. I have also sent clients to the Self Help Credit Union branch in Greenville. I hope this information is useful. I feel sad about all the sacrifices your family has made to start this business and hope you can find support to save it.



Sincerely,



Gail McDonald

Subject: help

Comment: January 29, 2009 To Whom It May Concern: I have three sons and my wife who is very determined not to lose our family business and residence. We began this venture in October of 2003. Starting out leasing a shop. We became highly recommended in our community. Recently we re-opened ( July 2008 ) a new facility. After being closed for two years, due to the building we were leasing being sold. Now I have my entire family devoting all their time without pay to our business. Its the small family businesses that can make a difference in the communities that we serve. We obtained a loan from Neuse River Development Authority for $162,000. which is a non-profit organization. It has had programs to help small businesses. This company has given us notice of their intent to close us down. Being a non- profit organization they need there payments to be able to remain in business as well. We have tried to explain that no one is getting work done steadily due to the economy. We also understand our obligations as well. With the current economy just about everyone has had hardships. We have heard that Neuse River Development Authority is losing SBA programs. With the very limited funding available to us we worked together to clear the land, erect a steel building, build walls, do the plumbing, windows, doors and the electrical (with supervision). These items being done by us gave us the opportunity to open for our community and family. After two years of being closed and many hardships this family faces losing everything we've worked so hard for including our home. All due to this economy. When we started this process it wasn't bad. Now we have work lined up with customers waiting on income tax returns to pay for their automotive repair needs. Once the economy picks back up. There will be steady work available, however we need help now since Neuse River Development Authority can not prolong our loan. To work so long and so hard to accomplish this goal and then lose it would be devastating. Is there help anywhere for todays small family businesses? Thank your for your consideration.

Dear Mr. McMullen:



Your question was forwarded to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks by the Governor’s Office for review and response. 



The Office of the Commissioner of Banks does not offer assistance in seeking financing for commercial or residential properties.  An option for a loan of this size would be to consult with larger financial institutions or commercial financing. 



Please feel free to visit: <http://www.nccob.org/NCCOB/FinancialInstitutions/Banking/StateCharteredBanks.htm>http://www.nccob.org/NCCOB/FinancialInstitutions/Banking/StateCharteredBanks.htm

Elected Officials - North Carolina

Subject:  Alcatel-Lucent Technologies - Charlotte

Dear Sirs:

I would like to share with you some important information.  Alcatel-Lucent,
a Paris based company; telecommunications plant based in Charlotte, N.C. has
give notice that there is a strong possibility of closing its location.
Alcatel-Lucent has chosen to close this facility to reduce cost and achieve
the synergies needed to remain competitive in the global manufacturing
market.  This location's work will be divided with some of its work going to
Arizona and the other portion going to Mexico.   Unfortunately, this closure
will cause approximately 225 positions to be eliminated; about 200 union
jobs and 25 management jobs.  The Charlotte location has been very
profitable.  Employees have performed above expectations on all areas for a
TL 9000 company.  The employees understand that the decision to close is
financial and not performance based.  It is sad that this is happening to
many union based companies in America.

I am asking you, the elected officials, to take notice of the trend of the
Labor Movement and speak candidly about American jobs disappearing from our
country.  We take our jobs seriously.  We want to keep jobs in America in
order that our children might have a future.  What ever has happened to
"Made in America"?

Alcatel-Lucent is located in Huntersville, N.C.  There are employees at this
location that have followed Lucent all over the country in an attempt to
keep their jobs.  This is the last of the unionized locations.  Some of the
employees travel two hours everyday to work at this location.  We do what we
need to do for our families to survive.  However, enough is enough.  We are
now putting our hope and faith in elected officials.  We are asking that you
save our jobs in order that our children and grandchildren will have a
future.  Please seriously consider our dilemma and do whatever you can to
right this situation.

Sincerely,
Beatrice Bates Gordon
Concern Union Worker
Empoloyee of Alcatel-Lucent

Subject: HELP HELP!!!!

Comment: Searching high and low I don’t know if you can help no one else seems to be able too. I hear about all these programs to help people who were laid off and are having problem paying there mortgage. That they should make contact early before things get to past due. Well I have tried countless time to find help and all I get are DEAD ENDS. If I was so irresponsible to charge on my credit cards and buried myself in debt there seems to be help around every corner. But that not my case I live in North Carolina I was laid-off from my job of 6 years September 8th 2006. My husband and I also had a business that he ran ;he worked up until September 26 of 2005 the day of his surgery. We were told in July of 2005 that my husband needed surgery and he would be back at work about 2 weeks later. He came through the surgery and was sent home. I called the doctor’s everyday that week to tell them he was not doing well, they told me I was over reacting. At the end of that week I decided to take him to The ER . Four days later they figured out he had gotten a Staph infection from the surgery. He was in and out of the ICU from that day on and died October of 2006. I’ve been looking for work and living off our saving which are now gone. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now? I can’t refinance because I don’t have a job and the mortgage is under my husbands name. So I can’t call them ,I did try, and the guy I spoke to was VERY RUDE and even though I’m on the paper work they won’t give me any information without talking to him. The interest is at 8.5% we bought the houses in 93.I don’t want to lose my house but I’ve called everywhere and I get nowhere. All I’m told there’s NO MONEY there’s NO HELP!!!! THERE’S NO JOBS!!!! THERE’S NOTHING!!! I’ve left several messages with all the agency I’ve been given the phone number for but no ones ever called me back that was in November 2008. What am I suppose to do? I was hoping to go back to school and get retrained in another field. But I can afford it. Because I was laid-off in 2006 I only got 23 weeks of unemployment 13 weeks the first extension and 7 weeks which ended the week before last. I’m aware that I’m not the only person in this situation so what should I do? I had to borrow money from my 87-year-old mother to pay my taxes. K. Lippman 571-374-0789

Dear Ms. Lopez:



The Office of Governor Beverly E. Perdue forwarded your inquiry to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks for a response to your mortgage related issues.



In order for this office to address your problem, you will need to file a formal complaint with this agency, asking your mortgage company to work with you during this period of financial difficulty. 



Please file your complaint on-line at our website: <http://www.nccob.org/>www.nccob.org



Go to our website, then click on the Consumer Assistance block.  Once on the Consumer Assistance page, you will find a link to our complaint form.  Fill out the form and submit it.  Print a copy of the completed form, sign it, and either fax or mail us the signed copy.  Once we have received the signature copy and any documentation pertinent to your complaint, we can contact the company on your behalf.



Please be aware that filing this complaint does not guarantee that your mortgage company can modify your loan or provide you with a workout plan.  What we can provide is making sure that your complaint gets to the right department within your mortgage company and is responded to with details of what options may be available to you at this time.  Please also understand that with your foreclosure date set for 02/10/2009, there may not be enough time to halt that action, but we will do our best to assist you.



If you have further questions regarding filing a complaint, please contact our office.



Regards,

I am looking some help saving my house. We started building our home in August '07 and we finished in Febuary '08. We where pre-aproved for a $250,000 loan, but when we finished our bank would not close on our construction loan. We paid our closing cost and put $6000 down when we closed. We even tried to sell the house just to get out of the construction loan, but where not able to sell. We are still in a construction loan paying intrest only and need help closing. We are not behind on our loan. My husband had his own business building houses for 6 years and like every one else has been out of work. Our credit is bad now a need help. We can not file for bankrupt with out closing on our house first. Plese help us. We have two young kids and would hate to lose our life savings we invested in home. Think you, Donna Critzer

Good morning, Ms. Metcalf,



The Governor’s Office received your email inquiry regarding available government programs to help you start a new business. They forwarded your email to the Department of Commerce Business ServiCenter for a response.



There are several resources specifically designed to assist new business startups and woman owned businesses in particular. All of the resources I’ll identify for you are legitimate organizations and most are a function of some level of government as you requested.



One of the best resources is the Small Business Center located at the community college. The telephone number for the Small Business Center at Central Carolina Community College in Sanford is (919) 774-6442. They provide assistance with developing your business plan as well as conducting classes and seminars beneficial to entrepreneurs starting new business. This is an excellent place to begin when starting a new business.



To have your business designated as a ‘woman owned business’, there are 2 government agencies you can work through. At the State level is the Office of Historically Underutilized  Businesses located in Raleigh. Their telephone number is (919) 807-2330 and their website is <http://www.doa.state.nc.us/hub>www.doa.state.nc.us/hub. At the Federal level, the Small Business Administration is the agency that provides this designation. They maintain an office in Cary, NC. Their telephone number is (919) 363-3215 and the website is <http://www.sba.gov>www.sba.gov.



The North Carolina Center for Women Business Owners provides programs and services that help entrepreneurs through consulting, business plan development, and training workshops. They are located in Fayetteville. The telephone number is (910) 323-3377 and their website is <http://www.wcof.org>www.wcof.org.



There is a new website that has been developed by the NC Department of Commerce in cooperation with other statewide, state funded agencies. The purpose of the website is to identify resources that are necessary, beneficial, and/or supportive to people starting or expanding a business in North Carolina. The website is <http://www.blnc.gov>www.blnc.gov which stands for Business Link North Carolina.



We would also encourage and invite you to call the NC Department of Commerce Business ServiCenter. Our toll free telephone number is 800-228-8443. Our consultants will talk with you to understand your business and then identify the steps, forms, and licenses you will need to open and operate your business. We are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 A.M. till 5:00 P.M.



We hope this information will be beneficial to you in starting your new business. We wish you every success and will be glad to help whenever possible.



Sincerely

Joe King

Dear Mr. Merrill,



Governor Purdue’s Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to assist you.  I am pleased to do so.  Via snail mail I have sent you some brochures which may help you find resources to help your business. The state does not have special funds for small businesses but we do encourage entrepreneurs like you to attend programs at your local community college; each institution has a Small Business Center which sponsors special classes and counseling. I recommend that you contact Director Bonnie Sweetin at 828-322-5455 or <mailto:bsweetin@cvcc.edu>bsweetin@cvcc.edu.



Sincerely,

Gail McDonald

Dear Mrs. Beach,

The Governor’s Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to respond. In these difficult economic times, I am receiving many letters like yours. Via snail mail I am sending you several brochures that we developed in partnership with the Rural Center. I hope these are helpful to you in identifying funding sources.

Subject: Small Business Help

Comment: Can someone explain to me how to get help for my small business? I have tried my bank and due to my business not being established for 2 years( July 2008), they won't give me the time of day.(BB&T)I have been watching the news and hearing all of this talk about helping small businesses and personally, I think its a farce. We started this business ( Trucking & Logistics)with nothing and built it pretty quickly and did really well last year, however, since December, it has suffered very badly. We run this from our home so our over head is low but even with that, we can hardly make ends meet. We do not over spend and live practically in poverty level as it is. So what can your office recommend we do? The way I see it, is that the big multi million dollar companies get new jets, and million dollar desks and us little guys struggling to eat get nothing. Why is that? Who can help us? Please advise which direction we should go..Thank You Sincerly Nick Cartos

Dear Mr. Hooks,

The Governor’s Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to respond. I am pleased to do so. I agree that the state cannot afford to lose its valuable small and medium sized businesses during this difficult recession. We have partnered with the NC Rural Center to develop informational resources to assist entrepreneurs . I will send you these publications via snail mail.  Other than courses and counseling at the community colleges –Small Business Centers--and through the Small Business Technology Development Centers (SBTDCs), the state does not have emergency resources to help struggling companies. I hope you will look at our publications and let me know if you think they are helpful to the owners of small businesses.

Comment: Is North Carolina offering any assistance to the growing number of small businesses that are suffering through this economic recession? We are losing too many small and medium sized businesses in the East and cannot afford to keep losing this valuable resource. This will undoubtedly impact the tourism in the coming season and for many years to come.

Subject: Homeowners facing foreclosure

Comment: How is the Governor giong to help Home Owners facing foreclosure considering all the bailout monies (taxpayers)are giving. What the homeownere who has found employment but are still having diffucult witha the lenders all the programs that are setup seem to be streamline for the lenders, not the consumer. I had lost my job and was unemployment for mts. and after I have found regular employment I'm still facing foreclosure because the lender refuses to work with me, even the HOPE line has to be assitance, the bottom line is that the lender has the upper hand, but I can continute to give my tax monies to them. Is there really help for consumers facing foreclosure?

Thanks for sharing this.  I’m not sure either but we will have our HR office check this out.  Sounds like the employee is still employed but the commerce email address is a hoax.  All of our email addresses are first letter of first name followed by last name @ nccommerce.com

And that certainly is not in accordance with this email.



Again, please let us investigate on this end and I’ll get back to you.

Subject: Save NC money and embarrassment

Comment: hundreds of thousands of dollars are being wasted in Department of Commerce. with the possibility of over $1 million by the end of this year. Some of these cost includes criminal actions taken against employees making complaints. Some of the criminal actions involve members of the Attorney General's office. Some employees may release evidence of bribes paid over the past 8 years for large incentives. The documents are hidden in state government servers. Here is a sample, businesses are required to make a "contribution" that is split in percentages. The Assisant Secretary of Administration works the financial magic through contracts and with the help of the CFO while the CIO and Deputy CIO covers the tracks (along with contractors and "trusted" employees) of electronic communications. Anyone putting the pieces together is then setup and fired. Then AG staff takes care of making sure the employee is no longer credible. Check all the former employees over the past 8 years who had "inappropriate" materials (porn etc.) on their computer etc. Then have Michael King give up other peoples' backup emails documents he has been keeping to protect himself (against Denise Sessoms orders). Last known to be in his bottom desk drawer on CD-Roms and DVD. I will make myself public if I lose my job or they are arrested.

Subject: Small Business

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, First, Congratulations on your victory becoming Governor of our great state. Second, I am currently one of eight stock holders of two companies in both New Bern and Trenton, North Carolina. I am a Christian man, who believes in God and family and looking out for my fellow man. I have served this country with honor in the US Army. I am coming to you for your help because I believe you have proved to be a woman of integrity and honor. Our New Bern office has been in business for over 19 years. You can check out what we do at: southtechplastic.com. Our company has been hit by this economy and we are at the door of having to file Chapter 11 or sell our company to an outside investor which has been a family run operation since May 1989. We manufacture plastic (Petro base) and laminate films so our problem started with the high fuel cost, then the down turn of the economy (we cater to automotive, boats, RV market), then our bank, who last year could not do enough for us, has now said they want us to pay off our line of credit in six months, beginning in January 2009 and refinance our machine loans somewhere else or they will basically shut us down. We had close to 100 employees at the beginning of 2008 and are now down to 19 employees, most working part time. We have run out of money and if we are to survive, we need between $2.5 to $3 million loan and our bank is not helping. We expect to pay it back; we do not want a hand out but a hand up. We are on a count down clock with the seconds ticking away. Mrs. Purdue, is there anything you and your administration could do to save our company? We believe we have a chance to overcome this economy if we can survive through February / March but with lack of funds it is getting more difficult as days go by. Please, can you help us; we are on the steps of uncertainty. Thank you for your time and may God’s Grace be with you always.

I currently own 15 properties in NC. I purchased these homes over the past 8 yrs. Since the BAILOUT I have been getting buried by lower rental income and decreased value. I can not sale the properties nor can I refinance them because I have over 4. I hear investors daily letting properties go in bulk because of this.
I may be right behind them because I have have no way to turn.

Can you tell me if anything in the BAILOUT is for the small investor and if so who I can call for help. I consider myself lower middle class as far as income goes and I was just trying to do better when I bought these properties. Just need help! Can you point me in right direction?

Thank you and God Bless

Telephone(910)2512273

Dear Mr. Solana:

I am writing this letter in the hope of obtaining some help, guidance and assistance in preventing the City of Wilmington from foreclosing on my mother’s home, Mary M. Wilson, 417 South 6th Street, on Tuesday January 6, 2009

I am the son of Mary M.Wilson, who died two years ago and would like to take the responsibility and enter into an agreement with you in order to prevent the home from being foreclosed. Medical illness, sickness, hospitalization and placing my sister in a nursing home would prevent them from enduring the past due amount of $22,000.

I really do not have all the answers, but it has torn my hear as I think about the death of my parents and now the recent placement of my sister in a nursing home because of Alzheimer, hospitalization of another my sister for a scheduled surgery and the current hospitalization of my brother in a nursing home because of other medical and physical reasons.

My name is Johnny L. Wilson. I am the third son of Mary and William E. Wilson and have been employed in the Department of Political Science at Clark Atlanta University for the past 21 years as a Tenured Faculty member. All I am asking is for hope, an opportunity a little time, a chance to raise the money or to give you access to my banking account whereby you can receive payments on the 30th of each month.

I guess, I ask these things in faith in the hope of appealing to you for help. I look forward to hearing from you. If you need to contact me, I can be reached at (404) 880-8245(W); 404 7635072(H) or by cell at (404) 2000699

Sincerely,

Johnny L. Wilson, Ph.D

Hey Kay,



Deanna Hatch is one of our NC Green Business Fund awardees in 2007-2008.  I have spoken with her about this project and I believe she needs to speak with someone from the Governor’s Office regarding her email and information.

Dear Governor Perdue,

OrganoFuels was a recipient of the 2007-2008 North Carolina Green Business Fund Grant, for which we are extremely grateful.  I met you in Raleigh on the occasion of the announcement of these awards.  We know that you are supportive of the developing "green" industry and that you understand the value of this toward important economic benefits. 

I am emailing to ask you for a support letter for a federal FY 2010 appropriations request.  The funds for this request will be directed toward a key aspect of the project.  Please see attached for further details.  

I have attached 3 documents.  One document is a cover letter that discusses this in more detail and outlines our need.  The second is a draft support letter to save time in the process.  The third is a power point presentation of our overall strategy for Economic Development and Sustainable Jobs for North Carolina.  OrganoFuels is part of a larger partnership alliance that is designed to reach these goals. 

Thank you very much for  your help and support in this matter. 

Sincerely,

DeAnna Hatch, PhD

Subject: save my home from foreclosure

Comment: Since Sept. 2007 I have been struggling to pay my mortgage. My loan was scheduled to adjust in Oct. 2007. In March 2008 the mortgage company agreed to modify my loan. Shortly thereafter, I defaulted on the loan again. It has taken me from Sept. 2007 to Feb. 1st 2009 to find full-time employment; I contacted my mortgage to notify them of the improvement in my income and pleaded for restructure of my loan. After retrieving all my financials, the lender led me to believe they would work with me on saving my home, since now I could afford the payments. I received a phone call on Feb. 11th stating that they would not honor a second modification. Even the non-profit organization NACA fought on my behalf to fight foreclosure and submitted several proposals that were denied. My home is scheduled to be auctioned on 2/24/2009. I believe the mortgage is being unfair. And if 2nd chances are not their policy then why not tell me that before requesting all my private information.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am operating a small business in East Bend, NC and have been banking with Wachovia, about the time Wells Fargo and Citigroup were fighting over Wachovia my bankers came out and called our operting loan we have with them. With the market like it is no other bank wants to carry us without tieing up all the stock holders assets as well as the companies assets. Is there anyway that Wachovia can be asked to work with us until the economy gets better so that we may pay them off then or is there a program thru our state goverment that will help us? Please help us keep our company. Thank you Janet L. Bates

Dear Mr. Ramsey: 



We just discovered that under North Carolina law, MGC is exempt from the license and registration requirements of the Mortgage Lending Act as MGC is a wholly-owned, second tier subsidiary of Beal Bank, a federal savings bank.  MGC has filed the required form with the Commissioner of Banks to claim this exempt status.



Also, Beal Bank is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, so you would need to file your complaint with that agency.  For your convenience, we have listed their contact information below:

Dear Ms. Taylor,



The Governor’s Office has received your letter and has asked the Department of Commerce to respond. I am pleased to do so. The state of North Carolina does not have grants for start-ups but we have developed brochures to advise entrepreneurs on where to go for both counseling and resources. I will send these to you via snail mail. You are wise not to use the internet sites; they provide materials like ours and charge handsomely for what you are entitled to have for free. Good luck in you endeavors.

Comment: I want to apply for a grant to open a business in Sparta. There are very few job here for the citizens. I want to open a business that can employee atleast 75 people. All of the grant sites on the internet want money to send you information. How can I possibly apply for a grant to open a business to help the people of my community?

Subject: Wachovia Bank

Comment: thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail. My brother Nicholas Brown lives in Southern Pines NC and is a registered voter. For the past few years he has been a real estate developer and a home builder. For most of those years he had a relationship and line of credit with Wachovia Bank. He never missed a payment for nearly two years, and was not only able to pay the interest on time he was also working on paying down the principal. He was building homes in the community for people that needed then. Furthermore, the relationship with the bank seemed just fine. Then unfortunately our father passed away last October from cancer and during that time my brother Nick was late on two payments of interest to the bank! Also, the credit crisis began unfolding scaring banks, lenders, and borrowers..There was no warning from Wachovia bank, no phone call, and no chance to try and catch up on the loan or interest. they immediately put him into foreclosure. My brother called them several times and even called their attorney to try and try to get them to budge or maybe work out some terms so foreclosure could be avoided. they would not. Once a client of the bank my brother was harassed by the special asset department of wachovia bank and meant to feel lower than he has ever felt. Given that they would not extend or budge my brother is now forced into bankruptcy protection because of wachovia bank and their lending prectices. Why is it that banks always do the wrong things at the wrong time? Furthermore, the houses that he built and the properties he owned with also go into foreclosure. I am sure this is not the only e-mail or letter like this, but i felt it necassary to speak up and make sure you know what is going on out there peoples lives are being ruined by the banks...I think and know that government is the only thing that will protect the people like my brother from further harm from the banking industry... Sincerely, Louis Meyer Brown jr. 4 wellington drive Pinehurst NC, 28374

Dear Mr. McMillan,



The Governor’s Office has received your email and has asked the Department of Commerce to assist you. I am pleased to do so.  The state does not have funding for new business start-ups, but we are working with the Rural

Center to develop guides to service providers for entrepreneurs. You are correct that the online “come-ons” about grants to start businesses are scams, and usually costly ones. We have not received information on programs for small business in the Stimulus package, but I will contact you again if I find useful sources for you. Via Snail mail I am sending our brochures. I hope they are helpful.





Sincerely,



Gail McDonald

Small Business Ombudsman

Subject: Grants for Small business expansion

Comment: Would like to know if there are any legitimate state/federal grants that one can apply for to expand existing small business. If so, who to contact for an application. Does any of the 2009 Recovery & Stimulus package offer any grant money to small businesses? Again, where to apply as it appears everything on line is a scam. Thanks for your time & assistance.
