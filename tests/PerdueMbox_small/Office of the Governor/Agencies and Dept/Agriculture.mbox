Commissioner Troxler,

Please find attached a reply to your letter (Re: IR 2007-091) with a copy to those you sent Re: IR 2007-091 to and others.  I will follow up with a paper copy to you and to each of your Cc listed in Re: IR 2007-091. 

In addition to my reply to your letter I have also added below an extract from the Town of Chapel Hill, NC,  "Agenda for meeting date: 9/22/2008 Agenda #5a."  The Town of Chapel Hill, NC has taken the use of hazardous herbicides very seriously and done for its citizens what the North Carolina Department of Agriculture has failed to do.  I hope your department can learn from them as you have from me.  It is interesting to know you are using my photos and YouTube videos in your vegetation management presentations. A picture is worth a thousand words, I am glad you have found some value in my efforts. It is my hope our state laws and regulations will be modernized so there are equal laws and regulations for everyone and not just for governing bodies/town that can only enforce a "will of change" with Duke Energy or any other utility company.

Town of Chapel Hill, NC,  Agenda for meeting date: 9/22/2008 Agenda #5a

Title of Agenda Item: Duke Energy’s Easement Maintenance Notification Process


<http://townhall.townofchapelhill.org/agendas/2008/01/14/5c/>http://townhall.townofchapelhill.org/agendas/2008/01/14/5c/
In discussions with Town staff Duke Energy has agreed to discontinue the use of herbicides as part of their vegetation maintenance program for their distribution line easements within the Town’s planning jurisdiction. When utilizing herbicides as part of their vegetation management program on their transmission line rights-of-way and easements, Duke Energy has agreed to provide the Town staff with notification at least four weeks prior to initiating this work. 


Respectfully,
Tommy Walls

Comment: We are needing for the position of Director of the Animal Ark (so named by the children of our community) and Animal Control to not only be learned in Management, but also, to have a heart for the animals and an awareness of the growing trend to place animals out of county and possibly out of state to avoid euthanzation of these innocent and loving creatures. How can we get the word out? I did write to NCSTate and have not heard back. Also, There is one woman in the county who is causing very negative actions and reactions and it has come to my attention that she has also contacted you with her complaints....I just want for you to hear of our needs, concerns, and efforts, as volunteers to help to make this shelter a real 'shelter' with hope and community involvment....this is sent in confidence, due to sensitivity of the nature of the problems that have occured and the people involved. I don't know who to trust, please...

Mr. Matt Baldwin;



            Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns with regards to the National Animal ID System or NAIS.  Let me assure you that domestic pets such as dogs and cats will not be part of any national identification system.  As you correctly point out, the focus of the system is on food producing animals.  The ability to trace our food source to the farm of origin has become especially important in light of the challenges faced with the seemingly endless news reports of tainted food, recalls and health risks from intentional and accidental contaminates.  The growing trend to eat locally produced food, including the "Got To Be NC" program, can take advantage of a proven system of traceability in promoting our North Carolina products and the many farms that produce those products.



            Another focus of the national identification system that closely relates to traceability is the ability to quickly identify, locate, and eradicate disease in our livestock populations.  The more rapid the response the more quickly we can return to our everyday practices that involve animal agriculture.  Although horses are used for a variety of non-food purposes in this country, they none-the-less can pose disease risks, especially when involved in activities where there are large numbers and come from wide regions of this country and abroad.  The horse industry has recently demanded traceability in such diseases as EHV-1 and Contagious Equine Metritis, where the mobile nature of the equine industry transports the potential for serious and foreign animal diseases throughout the country in a short period of time with devastating economic and health effects.



            We realize that "we're from the government and we're here to help" does not create a sense of security in most people.  Yet the purpose behind a uniform, national animal identification program of providing a rapid response to any disaster or disease outbreak that is necessary maintain the strength and viability of animal agriculture is more crucial today than ever before.  I would encourage you to take the time to go beyond the emotional driven rhetoric of the anti-NAIS crowd and investigate the system that is gaining widespread approval and acceptance around the world and in our state and nation.  At NCDA&CS we believe that NAIS truly promotes animal health, food safety and human health, and so do almost 13,000 fellow North Carolinians who have registered the farms and premises.

Subject: Docket No. APHIS-2007-0096, AKA N.A.I.S.

Comment: I am writing in regards to Docket No. APHIS-2007-0096, known to the public as NAIS. This proposal is simply an attempt to give large Commercial Ag operations even more of an unfair advantage in the market over small local producers. The claims made by the USDA that this is a disease-tracking program make no sense, as the local and State governments already have these programs in place, and they work quite well. NAIS will also impose high costs and government surveillance on every farmer and animal owner for no benefit, and will probably force many small local farms out of business. It will also make it next to impossible for homesteaders to raise small numbers animals for personal consumption. NAIS does nothing to improve food safety for consumers or prevent animal diseases. This program is a one-size-fits-all program developed by and for Commercial Agribusiness. NAIS will increase consolidation of our food supply in the hands of a few large companies and put the brakes on the growing movement toward local food systems with its high costs. I urge you to do everything within your power to defeat this proposal, as it will do nothing but negatively impact small farms. Thank you

Subject: NAIS

Comment: This needs to be stopped this will put small farmers out of business. It is said for the help of control disease. "Yet the program is silent on how that information would be used to prevent or control disease outbreaks. " But there is already something in place for this when I sell my animals at the local sale barn they tag each one with a number tag. They have all my info in the office and the numbers of each animal is placed in my record. So each one I sell can be trasted back to me. The NAIS farm animals but dogs, cats, pet rabbits, pet horses. Under this if you want to take your horse out for a ride off your land you will have to report it within 48 hours. http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/2007-06-01/National-Animal-ID-System.aspx Go to the above site and learn more. Please make sure this is not passed in North Carolina look out for the small farmers in your state. Thank you Connie

Mr. Ray - 
     Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my concerns regarding the proposed NAIS legislation.  I really appreciate your response, but I still strongly disagree with this legislation, or at least with the way it is currently written.  Not due to emotionally driven rhetoric, but just plain facts.  Conversely, the public food supply contamination news stories you refer to seem to fuel more emotionally driven rhetoric than factual discussion about NAIS.  Below are some facts that I feel deserve futher review, before the NAIS legislation should be seriously considered.

1)  You say "The ability to trace our food source to the farm of origin has become especially important in light of the challenges faced with the seemingly endless news reports of tainted food, recalls and health risks from intentional and accidental contaminates.".  I honestly do not see how the NAIS legislation helps prevent this tainted food, as most of the tainted food recalls were due to food becoming tainted AFTER THEY LEFT THE FARM, and tracing the contamination back to the farm seems a waste of time.  Isn't there a mechanism already in place (USDA inspections of slaugherhouses) that is supposed to stop contaminated foods from entering the US food supply?  By instituting redundant government programs, isn't this a waste of the taxpayer's money?
2)  I do not see the purpose of the NAIS legislation (as it is currently written) and how it applies to small local farmers that sell directly to the public.  When a farmer sells an animal to a customer, there is no need for "farm of origin" tracing.  The consumer knows where the animal came from, and if there is a problem with the animal, the consumer knows where to go.  The NAIS legislation really seems to be aimed at large corporate farms, and is too much of a "one size fits all" attempt of a solution.
3)  As a food producer myself, we raise a large amount of our family's food; such as eggs and meat, not to sell, but to consume in our home.  The way the NAIS legislation is currently written would require our family to register our home with the government as a farm, obtain a Premise ID, and pay all the associated fees and use taxes.  It would also require the filling out of government forms any time there is a birth, death, attack by coyote, etc., and pay a  fee each time a form is submitted.  As the food my family raises is for home consumption, and never enters the public food supply, I do not see how thusly applying the NAIS legislation protects the public.  Our family has made the choice to raise our own food, and we feel confident that the food that we raise is just as safe and healthy, if not more so, than food purchased at the store.  We do not feel it necessary to have the government monitor, inspect, or otherwise interfere with the way that produce our food, especially if in means that we foot the bill for the government's "help".

I feel that the NAIS legislation is not being written with the small farmer, or home food producer in mind.  It appears to me that large corporate farms would be the benefactor, and the legislation would hinder, or possibly even prevent small-scale agriculture.  By including home food producers, and small, direct-to-the-public farms in the NAIS legislation, it appears that the federal government is attempting to invade the privacy of its citizens, and subject them to unnecessary regulation.  I urge you to push for exemptions for the 2 groups above, and further examine the NAIS legislation.

Thank you,


Matt Baldwin
