FYI

Regarding Ms. Heffner’s inquiry concerning her daughter, Ms. Gammaro, there is not really anything we can do.  If Ms. Gammaro had contacted us directly, we would have directed her back to her attorney.  But because Ms. Heffner is not a party to Ms. Gammaro’s claim, I don’t think it would have been appropriate for us to respond directly to her with non-public information about the claim.

Please help. I live in NY state, but my daughter, Andrea Gammaro has lived and worked as a nurse in Morganton, NC for the past 9 years. In March she had her third child and returned to her job as a home health nurse six weeks later. Shortly after returning to work (June) she injured her back, taking care of her patient. The injury was reported and she continued to work, while the injury continued to get worse. At first workman's comp had her try physical therapy, which proved to be of no benefit. She wa s put on light duty and allowed to work 14 hours a week, because this was the number of hours she was working when the accident happened. Her back has contined to get worse, to the point where she can do little or nothing without being in excruciating pain. Finally in October the doctor (selected by workman's comp)decided surgery was necessary to fix her back. Workmans Comp agreed and the date for the surgery was set for Nov 25. On the 21st of Nov she reported to the hospital in Hickory for her pre op appointment and was told she didn't have an appointment that Workman's Comp had changed their mind and there would be no surgery. Now they want her to start over again by seeing a doctor in Mooresville. It makes no sense that she would have to travel that distance when there are excellent doctors in Hickory. My daughter is at the point now where she is unable to take care of her children without help and is about to lose her home due to the loss of income for the last 6 months. My hus band and I have been using our savings to keep them in their home, but we can't continue. All she wants is for her back to get fixed and be able to return to work. She needs someone to step in and make this happen. Her phone number is 828-438-1994. I am hoping that you care enough about the people in your state to help. My sincerest thanks.
Diane Heffner
