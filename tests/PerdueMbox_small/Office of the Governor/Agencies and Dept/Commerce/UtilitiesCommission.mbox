Dear Governor Easley and Governor Elect Perdue,



I enclose below the response to my enquiry by the NCUC.† †I appreciate that NCUC responded at all in regards to my letter to Governor Easley's office.† I was already aware of Ms. Brownlee's testimony.



This is not a satisfactory response on the part of the Utility Commission.† In the Commission's own Mission Statement, contained on their web page, there are three†relevant mission objectives.† (When a Mission Statement is made, it is assumed that the agency is committed and thus responsible for, achievement of the mission objectives)† These objectives are :



> ∑† Encourage and promote harmony between utility companies and their customers.

> ∑† Foster planned growth of public utility services.

> ∑† Coordinate energy supply facilities with the state's development.


Disavowal of the Commission's responsibility toward the people of North Carolina and the United States in regards to responsible development is an example of government that is out of control.† The Commission's endorsement of the destruction of a crucial state and national treasure of the people of North Carolina †will most certainly 1) seriously impair harmonious customer relations 2) show specific failure to appropriately plan growth by permitting needless destruction (there is plenty of non-historic land available for Duke to work with out here; this specific destruction is carelessness and laziness, not need)† 3)† failed to coordinate appropriate development for the state in regards to historic districts.† Thus, the†Commission openly violates its own directives.† Perhaps the Commission should just post a codicil on†its own webpage that†states that†it makes Mission Statements, but has no responsibility to attempt to fulfill them.



As always, when a bureaucracy is out of control, separate agencies spend their time pointing fingers at†other agencies and no one takes responsibility.††Since these agencies serve the people of North Carolina, why must the people (such as Ms. Brownlee) coordinate activities between the departments?† I was a Federal Civil Servant for 30 years, and the coordination between departments on the approval of similar projects was the responsibility of the government, not the client. It was a major part of my job, and my own gladly accepted responsibility, to "stop the buck" at my desk.† †



The bottom line is that an offense against the history of our state and country is imminent and it is the duty of all the government, particularly the managers, to prevent that offense.† Proper coordination with Duke Energy could easily solve this problem by assisting this utility in locating nearby, non-historic land for this project.†



Please look into this matter and develop a solution that will serve the people of NC now and for years to come--rather the careless self interest of Duke Energy.† I am sure they mean well, but do not obviously understand their duty to the public interest as many who work solely for profit do not.†The people appoint a government to regulate trade, and thus to encourage such people to understand their civic duty .†



Sincerely

Nancy Holmes Simpson, PhD

4154 S NC Hwy 150

Lexington NC 27295



PS.† In the freezing winter dead of night†on 3 February 1781, my 4th great grandfather crossed the Yadkin with General Greene.† Had they not made that crossing and the river not risen, there would be no battle of Guildford Courthouse and probably no surrender at Yorktown.† You and I would probably still be paying taxes to the Crown, sitting in Debtor's Prison or holding our worship services in secret.† I owe it to him and his comrades to do whatever I can to protest this disrespect.†



You owe it, too.†

Thank you for the update. I am sorry you could not get a signed copy from Duke Energy also. I will include your emails as part of my exhibits. As you may note Mr. Phil Ray of Duke Energy was on for a copy of the previous emails. I see no need to copy Duke Energy any longer in this matter. Again thank you.

Vickie Debnam, Complaint Analyst
Public Staff, Consumer Services Division,
This is a follow up to your letter and to our telephone conversation today. To which I am putting Mr. Phil Ray of Duke Energy on for a copy.
I would like to continue forward with a formal complaint as you have recommended by your supervision. I am not sure what the processes are so I will need your office's guidance. †I believe I have enough photo evidence to prove my case. My neighbor Mr. Munns has agreed to be a witness. †He was present during the situation.
I would like for your office as a mediator to request from Duke Energy a copy of the herbicidal refusal spray form that was US mail delivered to Mr. Phil Ray of Duke Energy. I would like to have a signed by Duke Energy for my records. I have asked for a copy from Duke Energy but I have not recieved one as of yet. They have had the form from several months now.
History for the situation:
The Jamestown News printed the below article on January 2, 2008, a Wednesday about Duke Energy.
Less than 3 working business days:
On the next Monday morning at 8:30 AM, January 7, 2008 Duke Energy had a full crew out behind my property cutting down a non-threatening tree in the trees next to the edge of the right of way. The tree is directly behind my house and adjacent to my land.
I believe with evidence I can prove that this was a form of bullying/intimidation by the local Duke Energy right of way management. I believe because I questioned their use of hazardous herbicides at the Piedmont Environmental Center and because the Jamestown News printed an article about it, the local Duke management was out to show me their power to do whatever they want. This is suppose to only happen in the movies. Out of all the thousands of trees in the state of North Carolina and Guildford County Duke Energy chose to come behind my property to cut down one single dead pine tree that was not a threat to the right of way. I fear for myself, my family, and my property. It was a dead pine tree this time, what will they do next? †A bully or an intimidator does not have to physically touch you or your property, there are many ways to get bullyed by someone. I am not going to stand idle for this type of treatment.
If the dead tree was spotted by a helicopter why did Duke Energy leave all the other dead trees next to it standing? I do not believe the tree was spotted by a helicopter. My wife saw a Duke Energy person taking a photo of the area just prior to cutting crew arriving. †
There are no laws that protect us the citizens from this type of conduct by a utility company. What can you do to help citizens like me in this type of situation? I love where I live and I should have a right to know when being subjected to hazardous pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals. It should be a basic human right.
Also Respectfully,
Tommy Walls

Dear Mr. Walls:

We have received a report from Duke Energy Carolinas in response to your correspondence dated March 18, 2008. †According to this document, Duke Energy has a 100 kV transmission line installed on a purchased right of way that runs behind the properties on Yorkleigh Lane, Jamestown, NC, including your home.

†The right of way gives Duke Energy the right to keep clear a 68‚Äô strip, and to cut down trees outside the specified strip that could endanger or interfere with the operation of the line. †Duke Energy‚Äôs transmission right of way policies provide that outside the specified strip, Duke Energy will cut down trees that would endanger the line up to 50 feet on either side of the line.

Beyond 50 feet, trees are removed if they are dead, dying, or leaning. †Duke Energy periodically inspects its transmission right of way using helicopters to identify ‚Äúdanger trees‚Äù. †Based on this inspection, a pine tree was selected for removal, and the photo you provided is what took place.

Our investigation further revealed that the tree identified by your photo is not located on your property; however it was cut down in accordance with Duke Energy‚Äôs policies. †The utility believes that the herbicides are a safe and appropriate way of managing vegetation on their right of way, and they can provide property owners the opportunity to designate the right of way on their property as a ‚Äúno-spray‚Äù zone by following an established procedure for notification and signage.

Please review this information carefully and advise us accordingly, should you have any additional questions or comments. †The Public Staff has the responsibility of representing the using and consuming public and is available should you experience future problems concerning regulated utility services in North Carolina.

Sincerely,



Vickie Debnam, Complaint Analyst

Commissioner Shaw,

Below is an email and pictures to validate Duke Energy's actions at the right of way behind my home that I am forwarding to you. †How would you like for a company to treat you like this? †I feel it was a form of imitimidation that I can not prove because Duke Energy is a power unto its self. It has me worried for my safety and the safety of my family. Out of the thousands of trees in Guildford County, Duke Energy chose a single tree dead pine tree behind my home that was 20 feet shorter than the AC power lines to cut down. †When I questioned the crew they said they had a ticket to cut it down. They said it may have been spotted by a helicopter. If that was true then they left a lot of dead trees standing that they should have cut down. The Duke contractor should have actually cut down the poplar tree he was climbing, it is taller than the AC power lines and poses more of a threat. The tops of poplar trees are known to get blown out with storms. Ask any tree expert. Feel free to share this with others if you would like.

Respectfully,
Tommy Walls

Your Honorable Pricey Harrison,
1-7-2008, Duke Energy is working directly in the right of way adjacent to and behind my †property. They are cutting down a single dead pine tree that was supposedly spotted from a Duke Energy Helicopter. The dead pine tree was there the last time Duke Energy came through and cut down threat trees. The dead pine tree is well below the ac power lines. It was of no real threat to anything. The crew was asked to remove the tree after is was cut down but they refused to remove it. Instead they piled the cuttings up in an area my neighbor and I had worked on and cleared the last time Duke Energy cut threat trees. Recently I was told by the Duke Energy representative in Raleigh I would be given at least a 3 day notice of any activity in the right of way back here, I got no notice. I called Mr. Phil Ray at Duke Energy he is going to investigate the situation. I hope Duke Energy will do what is right and remove the cut down tree and debris. †I find it strange that Duke Energy would single out one short dead pine tree behind my property to send a full crew out to cut down on a Monday morning the week after the Jamestown News printed the article on the herbicides. †I will give them the benefit of doubt and assume it is maintance activities as normal.

Your Honorable Governor Purdue,



North Carolina has no real laws in regulating the use of hazardous herbicides on private or public property by utility companies. NCDA has an expired worthless agreement that was never honored by Duke Energy. Duke Energy has sprayed hazardous herbicides†private and public land without any warnings or†notifications. It is land they do not†own but have a right of way to.††The use of hazardous herbicides is a new process in their right of way management. The town of Chapel has been successful in getting Duke Energy to quit using the hazardous herbicides because Duke Energy does not want to notify the citizens of Chapel Hill. Notifications was part of the original agreement that Duke Energy has never done. I can validate this because I am a private property land owner that Duke Energy has right of way across here in Jamestown, NC. How would you like for a group of non-speaking English workers to†show up on your property and proceed to spray your backyard with hazardous herbicides without any notifications, warnings, or the right to refuse? This is the process!



I have contacted Steve Troxler at the NCDA but he does not read his emails, the emails notifications are sent back as deleted and not read.



I at your urging while you were the Lt. Governor pursued the NC Utility services commission, they would not grant a hearing.



I just want Duke Energy to stop spraying without notifications and warnings. The notifications give land owners time to respond to a refusal which Duke Energy has completely ignored and does not practice as advertised.



I have a web link complete with pictures of what sprayed area looks like at: <http://citizens1.wordpress.com/>http://citizens1.wordpress.com/, I hope you will visit the website so you can educate yourself and staff to the situation.





Gratefully,

Tommy Walls

Subject: illegal practices

Comment: below is a letter that i sent to the eletric commission please help I LIVE IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA ND WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THE ELECTRIC COMPANIES PRACTICES AS BEING COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND PURELY UN-NECESSARY. MY BILL AND RATE HAVE BEEN JACKED UP TO AN UNFAIR RATE AND WITH PEOPLE HAVING NO INCOME, NO BUSINESS, LOSING HOMES, COMMITTING SUICIDE AND A HORRIFIC WINTER, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.. WE CANNOT PAY THE BILLS TO KEEP ELECTRIC ON THIS WINTER, PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FREEZING TO DEATH BECAUSE ETHE ELECTRIC COMPANY HAS CUT OFF THE ELECTRIC! I PERSONALLY HAD CALLED THE ELECTRIC COMPANY YESTERDAY TO TRY AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY THE BILLS IN INSTALLMENTS AND GET AN EXTENSION AND THE WOMAN WAS SO HEARTLESS AND RUDE SHE SAID THAT I BETTER PAY IT OR IT WOULD BE CUT OFF AND THERE IS NOTHING SHE CAN DO FOR ME. SHE ALSO STATED THAT A MAN HAD COME TO MAY HOUSE FO R THE PAST THREE MONTHS TO COLLECT PAYMENT AND HAS CHARGES ME 30.00 IN FEES FOR THIS BUT "THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY MEN TO MY HOUSE"! ABSOLUTELY NOT ONE! THIS IS A LIE AND THEY ARE CHARGING ME FEES FOR SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED. THEN I ANALYZE THE BILL EVEN FURTHER AND SEE THERE ARE UNCLAIMED CHARGES ADDED TO MY BILL, I ASK WHY IS MY BILL HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL STATEMENT AND SHE SAYS THEY ARE PENALTY FEES - I ASK FOR WHAT!? AND SHE SAYS SHE DOESNíT KNOW BUT IT WAS A FEE AND I HAD BETTER PAY IT. THEY ARE TACKING ON FEES AND CHARGING RATES WITH NO EXPLANATION AND NO BACKUP DOCUMENTATION, PROVIDING NO REASON OTHER THAN YOU HAVE TO PAY IT BECAUSE WE SAID YOU ARE BEING CHARGED FOR IT. ANOTHER NOTE - THIS SAME COMPANY HAS CUT PEOPLES ELECTRIC OFF AND REFUSE TO TURN BACK ON UNTIL THE CONSUMER PAID FOR REPAIR ON THE ELECTRIC BOX AND POLE PARTS. THE PARTS WERE DAMAGED AND THEY SAID WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR AND ELECTRIC WOULD NOT BE TURNED BACK ON UNTIL WE PAID FOR IT OUT OF OUR POCKET. AND THEY DID NOT TURN IT BACK ON. ONE WOMAN WENT A WEEK WITHOUT ELECTRIC, HEAT AND HOT WATER AND THE BILL WAS OVER 1000.00 AND SHE IS 70 YEARS OLD! I MYSELF WAS REQUIRED TO FIX A LUG NUT IN MY BOX AND HAD NO ELECTRIC AT MY BUSINESS FOR 4 DAYS AND OUT OF MY POCKET I HAD TO PAY. THIS IS UNJUST AND ILLEGAL AND THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS COMPANY AND ALL COMPANIES WHO ARE DOING THIS TO THE PUBLIC. WE CANNOT SURVIVIE WITH COMPANIES RAPING US LIKE THIS - PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO HELP US. I WILL BE FORWARDING THIS INFORMATION EVERYWHERE I CAN, TO GET THE PUBLIC NOTICE ON HOW THESE COMPANIES ARE SCAMMING US AS CONSUMERS AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS, ANY EFFORTS TO HELP STOP THIS. THANK YOU SINCERELY, JENNA BRYANT

Comment: In this economic hardship something needs to be done with the Power companies. In Sylva Nc we deal with Duke Energy, in the past it was Duke Power. My husband and I are on disability and have a 6 year old daughter. Our power bills have been outrageous, and Duke Energy will not make payment arragnments with people whereas Duke Power was glad to help and very understanding. We paid over 500.00 last month and only get a little over 1,000.00 per month. Today we got a disconnect notice saying we need to pay 78.00. This is hard they know people can not go without power and they will cut you off and not care if you have children in the home.

Subject: Duke Electric Co.

Comment: I read in the paper yesterday that Duke Energy is looking to get a rate increase. I am furious.First of all they received a rate increase of 4% in 2008 for the cost of fuel. Did they reduce that when the fuel prices decreased? No I don't think so. So when I read that a company nets a 1.36 BILLION dollar profit and had a 4th quarter profit of 36 million dollars and have enought nerve to ask for a rate increase. They also stated that we pay below average than other states, but never mentioned that other states (especially in the north) have a higher pay scale and a lower unemployment rate. Please explain why a company (who made a huge profit) during these rough economic times are asking for more money that their customers just don't have at this time. I understand there are some things they need to do, but let them use the money they made. If the need to put a steam scrubber in a substation that will cost maybe 10million then let them subtract it from the 1.36 BILLION. This needs to be checked into. Thank you.

Comment: Dear Governor, I voted for a change in North Carolina, here in Elizabeth City A change have directly happen and it is not for the good! I am a single parent and have a disable parent living with me. I work and my hours are being cut everyday, But my problem is I live in Elizabeth City,NC and the electric bill steadily rise 3 times in the last six months, My electric bill exceeds 500/monthly I would like for you and your staff to look into this situation, this is the only town that the light bill raise. Our city council decides to make life a living hell for the ones that are trying to keep there heads above water. It is so not, fair to us not only the elderly that have to decide whether to stay warm or pay for medicine. Governor, We need your help here in Elizabeth City, the only thing that the mayor says is that he can't talk to anyone. and we are not to pay only half of the bill, I would like desperately for your staff to look into Elizabeth City problem on why our electric bills are exceeding more than house mortgages. Some members of council didn't want the increase, My question is why is that council feel that going up four percent every other month is the answer to there problems that they have created. Please Governor I beg of you to please look into this situation as I struggle to take care of my family and try to keep my head from sinking. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you in these troubled times. God Bless you and all that YOU will do for the people of North Carolina

Dear Ms. Bartos:



Progress Energyís rate increase was given careful consideration before it was approved by the Utilities Commission.† Most of the increase covered the escalating cost of fuel and a very minor portion covered the cost of meeting new renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements.† The new rate was approved on December 1, 2008, and resulted in a typical residential bill increasing by 11 percent.†



The Public Staff does not know your specific billing arrangements with Progress Energy.† However, if your bill for $500 represents just one monthís usage, your usage was over 5,000 kilowatt-hours for that period.† This amount of usage is extremely high for one home (attachment included).



The Public Staff suggests that you contact Progress Energy at 1-888-999-8856 and request a Home Energy Check to determine additional ways you can save energy.† You can also perform an Online Home Energy Check at the following web address:



<http://www.progress-energy.com/custservice/carres/saving/energycheck/index.asp>http://www.progress-energy.com/custservice/carres/saving/energycheck/index.asp



Please contact us at 866-380-9816 or 919-733-9277 should you have additional questions.

Subject: Electric rate hikes

Comment: This is a copy of an email I sent to Com. Finley. Please help. ============================ I am appalled that our State government has allowed that rate hikes to continue for Progress Energy in light of all that we North Carolinians are economically suffering right now. For example, in our case of hardship, we are trying to support a disabled child, my husband is recently unemployed, our health insurance is about $1800 a month, and now our electric bills from Progress have been $500, $414. and $450 over the last three months. We have done all we can as we keep lowering our thermostat but in the interest of our health, we can do no more. We are just above the poverty line so we have no recourse but to beg you to look into this matter of reversing the rate hikes temporarily. Considering the amount of corporate greed we all have to swallow, it would be with great kindness and a sense of community that these rate hikes are turned back for a few months. Thank you for hearing me out. Kate Bartos

Comment: I sent a quick note the other day hoping this new administration might help us here in Pittsboro get our water problem solved. The water qulity for years has been severerly over the TThm levels set by the EPA but nothing has been done until recently. These high levels of TTHM can lead to cancer,kidney disease and nervous system problems. I have been getting notices from AQua Norht Carolina for 1 1/2 since we moved here telling us that the levels are way over the EPA standard. The town is in the process of correcting the problem but it was supposed to be done by year end 2008 and of course it is not. Shouldn't the town and AQua be responsible to supply clean water??? WE need your offices help!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

††††††††† My name is loretta brice. I am in school at Roanoke Chowan Community College. I am having some problems with my REC bill. It is $421.00 And I got an extention to the third of April. Right now I don't know how I am going to pay this.†I am usually o.k. but I had some unexpected problems that got me behind. One is†I couldn't afford oil so I had to use an eletric heater and my kitchen oven so that's why my bill is so high for one month. It is warming up now so I should be alright. If it is anything you can do please let me know. This is the first year this has happened. I received help from Cada earier and social servies. They are out of funds. I know people should be able to pay thier own bills but some times things happen. I don't intend for this to be an on going problem, but if i can just get bak on track this time I should†be†find.†

Dear Ms. Miles,



††††††††††††††† Our office is in receipt of your e-mail dated February 12, 2009, concerning rates on utility companies, and we appreciate your concerns regarding this matter.† I can only assume that you are referring to the fuel rates for the electric utilities that were recently approved.† If you are referring to Progress Energy, the State Law requires a hearing preceding each year for the request of fuel increases.



†The fuel increase, the renewable energy increase, and the energy efficiency increase made up the 10% cost of the fuel increase.† If you have any further concerns regarding the yearly hearing preceding which are required by State Law, you may contact your State Legislature for additional assistance.† Please review this information carefully and advise us accordingly, should you have any additional questions or comments.

Subject: utility costs

Comment: I have been a resident of Elizabeth City for 6 years. Our electric bills here are astronomical. My elderly neighbors were just forced to put their home up for sale after living here for more than 40 years. The electric bill for their 1200 square foot home cost them $400.00 for the month of February. Mine was over $500.00. In neighboring Camden County my friend with a 3100 square foot house had an electric bill of $267.00 for February. They do not have the City of Elizabeth City as their supplier. How is this discrepancy possible? We all heat our homes with a heat pump. Something is very wrong here. They have raised our electric bills 18% in one year and nothing is being done to stop this. In a town where the medium income is less than $30,000, utility bills such as these are beyond our reach. Please help us. People are suffering and no one seems to care. Thank you, Lorraine Ambrosio

Subject: City Utility Bills

Comment: I want to know who can I talk to regarding a city council for Elizabeth City, NC that shows no sense of caring for the people of the town they govern. The utility bills in Elizabeth City are through the roof. My bill last month was $599 and this months bill is $603. I am a manager of a low income housing development where most of my residents are on fixed incomes suffering with enormous bills also. Some can't pay the bills and are cut off even when they have children on healthcare machines. This is a citywide problem. The council voted to raise the rates which was totally outrageous. Our city has surplus money in the bank yet they still continue to raise our taxes and utility bills. WE NEED HELP! This can't continue, what can I do as a single citizen, I am so concerned for my residents and the elderly in this town. One of the council members stated that the elderly should turn off their electricity and wrap up in blankets. I felt that was so cold and uncaring. Ms. Perdue I voted for you and feel you can do a good job for our state, place direct me on steps to take to help in this dismal situation we are in. WE really need someone to help us.

Subject: Light Bills soaring!

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, Let me first of all say that it has been wonderful to see that we have a politician that actually does some work here in the state of NC. We have a situation here in Wilson that needs your attention I believe. Wilson Energy has been going on a billing spree with the people of Wilson. Light bills have been high as they have ever been and there has been no issue to resolve these matters. The only thing they have done was take on more debt to raise the light bills. I have friends and family whose light bills range from $750-$1000. These are houses probably no bigger than 1200 square ft. I just think it is totally ridicolous and that something should be done. The city council does not seem to respond to what we have to say. I just think some people have been in office too long and it is time for change. Can you please come and help us. There should be some kind of audit or inspection done to let us know where all this money we pay is going. I just hate to see people suffer because leaders make bad decisions. You know by looking at what the Bush administration has done to this country. I think the same mentality his here in the offices of Wilson. I also think the Mayor, who is Democratic, is scared or just doesn't care for what we go through. I come to you for advice and help. Thank you so much Mrs. Perdue for making NC a better place.
