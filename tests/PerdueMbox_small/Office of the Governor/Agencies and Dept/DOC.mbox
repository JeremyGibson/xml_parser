Dear Ms. McEachin,

The Governor's Office forwarded your E-mail to the North Carolina Department of Correction for response.

Your grandson's projected release date is April 28, 2009. He is currently in disciplinary segregation and therefore not earning any time credits toward his minimum date.

If you have further questions about your grandson and his incarceration, please feel free to call me at 1-800-368-1985, Monday through Friday (8:00AM - 5:00PM)

Sincerely,

Please let me know the status of Auturio R. McEachin-0588831. A few months ago I was contacted by an employee and asked if we could arrange to pick him up because he maybe getting an early release and I have not heard anything since. I was under the impression he would come home at least by January. I am his grandmother and I am so looking forward to his coming home real soon, if there is someone there that can help me please let me hear from you. The last time I called the Social Worker told me he could not put his hand on his file and would let me know his release date as soon as he found the file.

Please do all you can for him to go home real soon. I am getting old and I would like to see him set free.

Dear Ms. Floyd:

The Governor's Office forwarded your e-mail to the NC Department of Correction Public Affairs Office. You did not provide your son's name so I can only respond in general terms.

If your son was convicted for a crime committed after October 1, 1994, he is most likely under the Structured Sentencing Law which does not allow for early release or parole.

There is something called Medical Release. To qualify for release from prison under this law, inmates must be permanently and totally disabled, terminally ill or geriatric as defined in the law. The inmate must also be incapacitated to the extent that he or she does not pose a public safety risk. Inmates convicted of <http://www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/spac/Documents/app-f07.pdf>class A, B1 and B2 felonies and those required to register as sex offenders under the <http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByArticle/Chapter_14/Article_27A.html>North Carolina Sex Offender & Public Protection Act are not eligible for release under this law.  Inmates released under this law will be subject to supervision by the NC Division of Community Corrections.f

If you have further questions or comments, please call me toll-free at 1-800-368-1985.

Comment: Madam: I need to ask a question and dont truly know how to go about it. I have a son who has been in prison for 12 years, on the 3rd strike. He still has 4 years to go. I have his children and have had all this time. The mother is not really in the picture. I have done okay until now, but today i went to the doctor and had an ekg that was abnormal. They are sending the ekg to a cardiologist. I am very scared right now. The boys are 11 and 18 and in school. Is there any chance he could get out sooner, just in case. There is no one else to help with these boys. Could you look into this. I know you have much on your plate right now, so if you cant or choose not to, I will try to understand. thank you . shirley floyd

Email: maggie.panther@gmail.com

Subject: Corrections phone system

Comment: My question is: why? Why has the state taken an action that will hurt so many families? I am writing to express my strong objection to the state's prison system switching to Global Tel Link as the mandatory phone carrier for prisoner communications. 1. If you Google this company, you will see MANY complaints and examples of fraud related to their prison communications division. 2. I have just followed the instructions to set up an account so that I can communicate with my daughter at SCI, and they charged a 20% service fee. I paid $50 with a credit card, and they took $9.50. 3. Since $50 is the largest amount you can pre-pay at one time, they will be charging this unreasonable fee to families frequently. 4. The former system, Correctional Billing Services, worked just fine, had no limits on prepay amounts, allowed us to add and manage multiple phone numbers and this could all be done through a web site. This is going to have a huge impact on families. As a taxpayer, state employee, and parent of an inmate, I am requesting that you look into the basis for this change and whether this is truly the way you want your division to serve the people of this state. Thank you for your time...and here are some links about Global Tel Link: http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/fraud-and-scam-c139313.html http://www.my3cents.com/productReview.cgi?company=Global+Tel+Link/MCI

Dear Ms. Swann:

The Governor's Office forwarded your e-mail to the NC Department of Correction Public Affairs Office for response.  You write about "60% time for non-violent criminals." 

To my knowledge there isn't any 60% legislation pending. Every year many bills are introduced that never become law.  

You didn't provide your son's name so I can't address his particular situation. His conditions are determined by the laws in effect when he was sentenced (i.e. pre-Fair, Fair Sentencing or Structured Sentencing).

If you have other questions or comments, please call me at 1-800-368-1985.

Subject: Please help my Dad.

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, My name is James Drye and I am a young Disabled Veteran out of the the US Army, my father has been a great dad for my whole family which (myself, my 2 sisters and my brother & mother) but he is not perffect and made a mistake that sent him to jail for 6 yrs and 11 monthes. His charge was CHEAT-PROPERTY/SERVICES. At the time he was not thinking and was going thru a midlife crisis, very afraid of what would happen to our family if he died and leaving the family with nothing. My father is a great man and has never been trouble for any thing his whole life. He was charged in 2005 but did not find out his punishment until Sept. of 2007.. In those 2 yrs of waiting, we never knew if we would come home and find him dead by suicide due to the stress he was under and not knowing if the next day was going to be his last day of freedom. The boss of the company that my father worked for told him at the time in 2005 when my dad told them what he had done that if he turned over his life insurance policy and all his retirement and left the company that they would not turn him in. After they got the funds they called the police. They came and arrested my father, but let him sign his self out the same day cause he was not a flight risk and had never been in trouble. I know that he made a mistake, we all do, but I think he was done wrong by his company even though he broke the law. Of course they denied saying anything or making any deal after they got his retirement and life insurance policy. Our family could not afford the best lawyer so my father got 6 + yrs. He went to jail last Sept. 2007 and since he has been in there has already moved all the way up to a place with no fence or armed guards. My mother still has my 2 sisters and my brother at home to take care of on 1 income and it is very hard. My question for you is what can I or my family do to get my father released early? Since he has been at this no fence prison and able to work a little it has given him a little taste of freedom and it has made him very down and depressed. It is very hard for all of us. I have a 4 yr old girl and she does not understand where her grandpa is and why yet. I do not want my dad and her to miss those golden yrs together. My dad is a great man and we love him so much, he is the only father we'll ever have. I know you are a very busy woman and this is probley not that important to you but it is very important to me and my family. I sent a letter to the last Governor with no luck and I hoping you will be able to help. If there is any thing you can do or we can do to get my father released early please let me know. His name is PHILLIP E DRYE and his DOC # is 1044091 and is located in BUNCOMBE CC. Please let me know... Sincerely, James C DRYE, Disabled Veteran

Ms. Hunt -

Your e-mail to Governor Perdue's office was referred to the Department of Correction for a response.

Before he left office, Governor Easley directed state agencies to develop budget reduction options that totaled 3%, 5% and 7% of their budgets.  These are designed to be options that Governor Perdue can work from as she begins to craft her state budget for the next two years.  These are simply options for consideration, no decisions have been made yet.

Department of Correction prepared a list of options that includes the potential closure several of our oldest and smallest prisons, including Cleveland Correctional Center.  This is not a recommended alternative, and the Department hopes Cleveland CC can remain open.   In cases where closures have occurred, this agency has a history of working to help employees affected by budget reductions and we will continue to make every effort to protect employee jobs.

Thank you for sharing your concerns.

Dear Ms. Overcash:



Your e-mail was forwarded to the NC Department of Correction for response. You are asking that your sister receive early release or a pardon.



Please note that your sister was convicted under the Structured Sentencing Act, which eliminates parole or early release for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. The Structured Sentencing Act mandates that the offender serve at least 100% of the minimum sentence and approximately 85% of the maximum sentence. 



Under our constitutional system, the Executive and Judicial branches of government are separate and distinct.  As head of the Executive branch, Governor Easley has no jurisdiction to investigate a court matter or intervene with a judgeâs decision.



However, you may wish to contact one of the following agencies to determine if they are able to assist you:




NC Prisoner Legal Services

PO Box 25397

Raleigh, NC  27611

Comment: January 31, 2009 Governor Bev Perdue Office of the Governor 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Bev Perdue: I am writing in regards to Julie Davis Inmate # 0101642. She is serving time in the North Carolina Institute for Women in Raleigh, North Carolina for a conviction she received on July 2nd 2007. She was charged with 1st Degree Murder of her Step Brother, Phillip Miller on July 5th of 2006. She received a plea agreement of a lesser charge to Voluntary Manslaughter. She is my sister and this has been a very difficult time for my whole family. I am writing you in hopes of an early release or Pardon for Julie. I hope you will take the time to read my letter and consider a miracle for my family. I have enclosed an article from the Salisbury Post and a copy of the letter Julie wrote and read to the judge. I love my sister and I loved my brother so much. It has been very difficult during this ordeal along with losing our grandmother last year. Julie and Phillip were very close and have always depended on each other through a lot of hard times. My brother had Colorectal Cancer and his pain was so intense that he had resorted to street drugs and in those last few weeks before his death had gotten involved with hard street drugs very badly. My father even took him at times to purchase Marijuana and other substances. The day before he had told my mom that Julie had a rude awaking if she came over. He was also so messed up the day before that my mom could not understand a word that he was saying. He had also gotten into a fight with the guy in the park where they lived and he had hit my brother but Phillip would not tell anyone this. It was over drugs and money. The day before this my brother had told my mom that he needed 250.00 to pay a drug dealer or he was going to kill him or her. The neighbor I am referring to, I had made the detectives, attorney and others aware of Phillip and Rossâ fight but never in any of Julieâs motion of discovery was Ross ever questioned. My other brother is the one that told me about their disagreement the day before so I think there is something to this. There are still a lot of questions that were never answered. Once my sister gave a statement, the department stopped pushing and questioning. My brother was mad at her for not taking him to get more alcohol and he pulled a knife on her and they rustled with the knife and she grabbed the knife and stabbed him once and then ran out of the house and came back around to the back of the back door and went into my momsâ room and waited on her boyfriend to get there and never came out until he got there. That is when they found Phillip lying dead on the floor. There was ample time that allowed someone else, (Ross, drug dealers or etc to stab Phillip). My brother and sister are not vicious people, it is just that the alcohol and drugs give them both that liquid courage that they need and then they would argue over the booze. My brother has had a very rough life with our father and Julie had a difficult life with her dad also. We all have the same mom but Phillip and I had the same dad and Tom and Julie had the same dad. Our fathers have never really been there for us. Except for the past 5 years that Phillip has had the cancer. But there have been times that my dad would just bless Phillip out and then Phillip would drown those hurt feelings in drugs and alcohol. In past years Phillip has also tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrist and arms. We have also wondered if maybe he was so depressed that night that after Julie stabbed him he was feeling so bad because they fought, that he stabbed himself and slid the knife under the couch. If Julie had reached to put the knife under the couch, Phillip would have grabbed her again. She was beat very badly and him too but we think most of his come from him falling and my mom said he had some bruises from the day before when him and Ross got into it. Julie even seen a place earlier that day and questioned him about it and he said, âOh that is where I finally got some sleep and must have laid on itâ. There was hair in the living room where he grabbed her by her hair and pulled her back in the trailer when she was trying to leave. The DA and Lawyer even said that this could have happened but we canât prove it. When I was talking to the District Attorney, Bill Kennerly once he told me that he knew if Phillip had lived through this, Phillip would not have pressed charges against Julie, that he never has. Regardless of what my dad Jack Miller says Mr. Bill Kennerly is an excellent District Attorney whom I respect very much. I am the one that had to clean up the crime scene and that was very difficult. Julies hair was all over the living room (looked like rats balled up and even the Detective said in her statement that there was hair falling out in the police car. I truly believe my sister when she says, âIf anything comes out of my brothers death, I will NEVER touch another drop of alcohol!â. She wants to be a subs abuse counselor so that she can show people what drugs and alcohol can cause a person to do. My father Jack Miller who is Phillips dad, and mine is so bitter at me for speaking in the courtroom. I only said, âIf they had not been drinking and doing other things, that my brother would be alive and we would not have been in courtâ. My brother would be the first person to stand up and say, to forgive. We were both a lot alike because I know that my God says I have to forgive and move on. I will NEVER forget my brother and what he means to me. I still cry a lot because now I have also lost my sister who I help raise when our mother had to work all the time to support us. Me and Phillip along with Julie and our other brother Tom all had to grow up with Alcoholic Dads and that is the biggest reason we all clung to each other. Julie has a little girl who is now 8 and who loves her mother so very much. She will tell me, âConnie, I loved Uncle Phillip but I love my mommy too and God is making her better so that she can come home to me.â Our Mother just turned 71 years old and we are all so close to her, especially Julie which moma calls her (Baby Bear). My mother just worries so much that she will never be able to spend quality time with Julie again, that she feels she will not live long enough. She has had cancer and now has Emphazema and on Oxygen. She lost her mother that was 92 years. My mother depends on us to help her at times, but is a very strong willed woman. My mother is in the hospital with Pneumonia and Pleurisy. The doctor has told me that she is terminal and he is not sure if she will get out of the hospital that he knows she is a fighter but her lungs are paper thin and not sure if she has the fight still left in her. He is going to be sending her home with Hospice and I have already been out for 9 days from my job. I work a full time job. My brother, Julieâs brother does too along with his wife. The doctor says she will need to have someone with her 24/7 and the hospice nurse will come out once a day and stay 1 to 1 Â½ hours a day. I need help. I am going to try to stay at night with her and I am looking for volunteers to help. I have been very discouraged because people will say if you need me let me know and then when you do they are not able to. I cannot get anyone to commit to help me. My mom no I have the money to pay after Medicare does not pay in a nursing home. They want to keep all her check a month except for $275 and my mom has bills that add up to $800 a month and her check is not much over that. I cannot do this. I value my job because I have a wonderful job and there are a lot of people looking for a job and would want my job. I will be the only one in charge of her medicine once she comes home with hospice along with the hospice nurse which will be under lock and key, so no one else will have access to the medicines which I trust Julie whole hearted. I am asking for a miracle that you would see it in your heart to help me and give Julie an early release. Julie has said her 2 main things that she wants to do when she is released is to make up to her daughter for ruining her life and to make up to her mom for all the wrong and hurtful things she done to her in her earlier years. If something would happen to our mom while she is in prison, I feel it would set Julie back from what she has achieved so far and she would not forgive herself. By giving her early release you would help me, my mom and Julie and Alexis (Julieâs daughter). It would give Julie a chance to feel like she made a difference in our moms last days. I know my sister has changed and I know she will come out and make a difference in her life. She has lost so much in 4 years. Our stepfather died in 2005, our brother in 2006 and our grandmother in 2007. Please have mercy on her. If you read the newspaper articles from the plea bargain you will see where the Judge made the comment to my father Jack Miller during the time he was addressing him regarding his letter to the Judge, you will see where he made the comment, âIf the case would have went to trial the evidence would have been enough for jurors to find Craig guilty of involuntary manslaughter or even to return a not guilty verdict. The reason why she chose a plea is her past was bad and she was worried that they may sentence her to 25 years to life. She now wishes she would have taken a chance but did not want to risk the chance with her daughterâs life and not getting to be with her as she grew up. I know if we could ask my brother that died what he thought I know he would say give her another chance because he would be the first to say forgive her. He loved her very much as she loved him also. I know that the Prison system is so over crowded and my sister is not a bad person. She is just my sister who has been dealt a raw hand of life and took the wrong road. When she is not drinking she is the most enjoyable person to be around. Is there not systems where she can get early release and get into programs and if she does not comply she will have to go back? I KNOW she will not ever do anything like this again. Her Lawyer proved to her that all her life that she would drink to cover up the pain she had of her life (there are more details of what happened to her when she was growing up). He told her that she has been through all this in the past year and if she could get through this then she could get through anything. He said people through his experience donât drink or take drugs to get high, they do this to cover up the life that they do not like. My sister has been taking schooling since she came to Raleigh and enrolled in all that she can and attending the church groups when they have them and has NO infractions or any other problems. My father even wrote a letter to the Judge in this case and made accusations toward the District Attorney not doing his job, which may have helped her case. Also, my father has threatened several times to kill my sister. I love my dad but his hatred is going to kill him. Please what ever you can do would greatly be appreciated. This would make a very sick lady a very happy lady and would also help me out. I also have had heart surgery so a lot on me could cause me more health problems so any help caring for mom would be greatly appreciated. I hope you donât feel that I am justify what Julie done, but I just know the days preceding to this was out of my brothers character (the alcohol just took over). His blood level in the Autopsy Report showed it was 4 times the legal limit along with crack and pills. I miss Phillip so very much and I love Julie so much. Please I am asking for a Pardon or leniency in this case. Maybe start out with house arrest to see how she does and then complete release with supervised probation. Good Luck in your new position. I knew there was a reason I voted for you and I know you are a very fair and just person from what I have already seen you accomplish. I was hoping to come and meet you at Livingstone College in Salisbury. Please if there is anything that you can do to help me, I will be indebted to you and will continue to support all that you do regardless. Again, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this letter. Connie Overcash You can reach me by mail at my address: Connie Overcash 107 Cruse Circle Salisbury, NC 28146 704 213-6170 cell phone I am forwarding this email but I am also sending it by mail with a copy of the newspaper articles and a picture of Phillip and Julie at her wedding so that you can see the closeness they shared. She lives everyday with the truth of what happened that night. Thank you Bev.

Hi,

I called this lady back -- explained that I could only address concerns about DOC (not courts or jails).  She had multiple concerns: job assignment; medical care; visitation; disciplinary issues; transportation (bus rather than state car), etc.  I answered as many questions as I could and assured her I would inform the Superintendent as well.

Thanks,

Subject: Antt

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, My name is Katie Tucker. I am writing you on behalf of Jeremy Goldner, my fiancee. He recently sent you a letter by mail informing you of his situation. He is currently being held at Umstead Correctional Center under the conviction of felony larceny and larceny after breaking and entering. He is serving a sentence of ten months with two months time served. I am contacting you to ask for your help. Im not sure if you can do anything for us but I figure its worth a shot. My fiancee does not deserve to be where he is at the time. He is a very upstanding individual who made a mistake like the majority of us do. Before he was incarcerated he had a steady job, reliable transportation, a home to himself, and always has a supporting family including myself and our son Lane who is two years old and missing his father terribly as well as myself. This is the only thing on his record, he has never been involved with any other crime. Jeremy nor myself could not afford a lawyer so he was appionted one. I feel that if he would have had a hired attorney he would be home right now where he belongs and that is ashame. Jeremy was on probation for probably two years in which was going fine until restitution got just way to hard to pay. It was up to about 400 dollars a month which was very hard and we were srtuggling so it all went downhill from there. Im just trying to get Jeremy's voice heard, he has alot of people here who care about him and want to see him do good. Please Governor if you can do anything to help us please do so. If you could somehow bring Jeremy home I would be so grateful and so would a certain someone else. Im reffering to his son, he is a very smart child and he wonders everyday where his dada is and i tell him everytime that he is a work. Although, I know different. I appreciate you for taking the time to read this e-mail. Please help us. Thank you. Sincerely, Katie

Mr. Severcool -
You had a question that you submitted to the governor's office, about the hiring freeze regarding Correctional Officers.  We are actually hiring Correctional Officers on a limited basis.  Based on the vacancy rate in each individual prison, a determination is made whether to hire any new Correctional Officers.  We don't know how long this hiring slow down will last.  The whole hiring slow down is related to budget issue and there is no way to know how long we'll be in this circumstance. 

If you have any further questions, pls call me at 919-716-3749. 

Good luck in your job search.

Please see DOP Region Director Patricia Chavis' response (e-mail) below:


Ms. Shaw:
I received the letter which you had e-mailed to the Governor's Office and I am responding.
Thank you for sharing your comments about the staffing situation at Tabor Correctional. Your sentiments are similar to other staff in other locations because we are all concerned about the budget crisis and the impact it is having on our correctional facilities. Part of your comments are correct in that the final population at some point in time is set to be 1500, with an increase in the staffing. As of this past Monday, the population was at 941. Phase Two of the recruitment is to get underway hopefully very soon, and that would yield some added 61-63 Correctional Officers. We have requested that those additional staff be unfrozen as is the current process and we are awaiting action on that request.  There is not a ratio for staff to inmates; we have not had a 1 to 45 ratio, and I'd be interested to know where you got that from.  The comment that this "does not meet the NC DOC or state policy regulations" - what regulations are you referring to?  The facility roster management takes into account the number of posts to be manned on a 24/7 clock, with a relief factor figured in, which yields the number of correctional staff determined that a facility would need, and it also takes into account the amount of annual training per certified staff, an average number for transports posts, STG factors, and a host of other operations issues that a facility management would have to deal with. The DOP  arrives at a tally or total number of staff that the facility should have, and if the Legislature funds these positions, we have to request authorizations to proceed to recruit and hire for the posts. Currently with the stated population now in-place, the staff in place is adequate. We are trying to get other positions filled to meet the demands of the continued influx of inmates. We are truly aware of the position we are in when we don't have enough staff, and it gets worse when staff abuse leave time, lay-out of  work, or are out of work with legitimate concerns such as family illness, personal sickness, injury leave, military leave, etc.  Needless to say, we agonize over overtime, staff morale, dealing with those who abuse leave time and our inability to give staff vacation, time off, etc. Your points are well-taken and I truly appreciate your thoughts, but please understand we are aware of the many items that we have to factor in anytime we suffer a budget situation, and I do worry about the effect that the  budget crisis will and is having on the correctional system, as well as the citizens of Our state. Again, I do appreciate your sharing your thoughts, and if I can assist you further, please do not hesitate to contact me or other staff in this office. I can reached at 910-944-2359 if you care to call. Again, thank you so much. [Patricia Chavis]

Subject: Hiring Freeze

Comment: Hello, I am a NC DOC employee. I am currently working at Tabor Correctional in Tabor City, NC. I would like for you to be aware of the danger we correction officers face during a hiring freeze. The facility I work at is supposed to be stafed by 500 plus with an inmate population of 1500. On a good day working on the blue unit (the facility as a whole is split into four housing units) where I work daily. We are lucky if we have 9 Correction Officers. On the blue Unit we supervise over four houndred medium custody inmates. Thats almost a 1 to 45 ratio, and does not meet the NC DOC or State Policy regulations. I understand the budget crisis, but unlike other NC State Jobs like DOT or DMV. Our positions when not properly staffed present real problems that can occur such as assults and riots. Since the hiring freeze has taking affect many Correctional Officers have quite or been unavoidbly fired. The Correctional Officer field of employment should always have a continuous hiring process. Please look into this matter and become abreast on the danger of understaffed prisons not just the one I am employed with, but the others in NC as well that are feeling the effect of being understaffed. Sincerely, Samantha Shaw

"Mr. Stone -
I received your email (below) from the Governor's Office and want to give you an update on our hiring situation....

The agency is doing some limited hiring of Correctional Officers and other public safety positions.  Our hiring activity is less than what it would be if we did not have to address the state's budget issues. 

You show in our applicant tracking system as having passed our screening tests and are interested in working at the prisons  in Harnett, Robeson and Sampson counties.  We are receiving a lot of applications at this time, if you remain interested in working here, I would give a quick call to the prisons  on a monthly basis just to let them know you are interested, that you have prior experience, and that you are still available. 

Good luck in your job search.  You may call me at the number below if you have additional questions.

Beginning in April 14th 1993 Vandon was processed at Polk Youth Center to serve 4 - 10 year sentences under the Fair Sentencing Act (1/8th Law) Raleigh consolidated his 4 - 10 year sentences at this point, and cut 40 years to 20 years consolidated. This is the method the system has used to calculate his time up to this point of his incarceration. All of his #3 gain time and merit days have came off the last 10 year sentence which he is working on now. Every time that he has been on a #3 gain time job his max date (PRD) has maintained no later than 2009. Vandon made parole on March 26th 2004. On July 23rd 2008, he violated parole. Once he was returned to prison he was processed at Central Prison in Raleigh, and now his sentences have been separated and gain time added to each 10 year sentence. His time has never been calculated in this way until now. He began his last 10 year sentence in 2006 with a max date on #3 gain time of September 3rd, 2009 . He is currently on #3 gain time, and his max date has changed to August 7th, 2010. Off gain time the date will be January 28th, 2011. I have devoted all of my free time to researching and trying to make sense of my husbandâs sentencing. I have educated myself in the policies that either support or contradict the changes in his PRD. I have spoken to several people throughout the chain of NC-DOC in Raleigh. No one is able to satisfactorily explain the PRD date change. In December of 2008 Combined Records in Raleigh stated that the 2009 date changed to 2010 because of infractions that Vandon "owed" from the years of 1993 (when he was originally sentenced) to 2003. They stated that he owed 500 days + 21 days that he was penalized for. There were a total of 28 infractions. At the time of these infractions the lost time was applied immediately to each one as it occurred. I find it contradictory that Vandon is now having these infractions reapplied to his sentence. These infractions have not only been accounted for in his sentencing, but are being added again. Furthermore, the gain time that he lost as a result of these infractions was taken from him at the time of the charges, and can not be reapplied because that portion of his sentence is expired. If he owed any time for infractions the time would have been calculated or added to his sentencing prior to him being paroled in 2004. I am addressing these issues to you, as I feel that you will be able to help us, and should be made aware of the inconsistencies. My only recourse is to hire an attorney to address this for us. I am trying to avoid doing that as I believe this can be dealt with within the "system". And that would just add further financial strain on my family. We understand that my husband committed crimes and we believe that he has served his punishment. I can honestly say that up until Vandon and I met in 2004 he had no one. He not only grew up in the system, but he had been incarcerated since his youth. Although our road has not been an easy one, I know that Vandon is trying his best to move forward, and rise above the mistakes and crimes he has committed. In addition to all of this, his gain time hasn't been calculated correctly by his programmer - Mr. Hammrick. Vandon is serving the last 10 yr sentence (which is still under the fair sentencing act) So to run it down to the best of my knowledge........ 10 yrs. cut to 5 which the 5yrs is your good time, and on #3 gain time (6 days per month) the 5 yrs your serving that would be 72 a yr. 360 days for 5 yrs.. Through all this delima if the gain time was calculated correctly we would be satisfied. I thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I beg of you to help us to resolve these issues. Please feel free to contact me anytime if there is any way that I can help or if you need further information. 828-659-9271 mtndewmom1123@yahoo.com Also please feel free to forward this correspondence to any appropriate office you deem necessary. Most Sincerely, Rhonda Heath Here is a breakdown of the sentences delivered to me by combined records in Raleigh 1st Sentence - Time Served 04/12/93 -- 03/08/97 231 days Gain Time 72 days Merit 50 days Lost good time 2nd Sentence Time Served 03/08/97 -- 11/18/01 243 days Gain Time 316 days Merit 450 days Lost good time 3rd Sentence Time Served 11/18/01 -- 02/09/06 173 days Gain Time 108 days Merit 000 days Lost good time

Subject: Roxanna Fuller

Comment: Dear Governer, I am writing you on behalf of my sister-in-law, Roxanna Fuller. On November 27, 2008 my sister-in-law, Roxanna Fuller was taken into custory at the Dare County Dentetion Center for violation of her probation. Her stay was uneventful until December 19 when she fell at the center and suffered a sever head injury which resulted in a ruputered brain aneurysm, she was treated at Norfork General Hospital and release after a 2 week stay in ICU on January 6th. At this time she was very weak and was unable to do very little for herself. On January 13 she had a court date for a DWI which she had received in 2006. Her case was heard in Superior Court by Judge Jerry Tillett, she pleaded guilty to the charges and was given a 6 month active sentence in prison. Judge Tillett had her sentance begin that day. She was only about 21/2 weeks post-op from a sever head injury and he sentenced her to prison. He did not take into account her very weakened condition or that she had a follow-up appointment with her neurosurgeon on January 19. I believe that the punishment was just but I do not believe that the judge did not take in to consideration her physical condition. I feel he disregarded a serious medical condition that needs close follow-up by a neurosugeon when he could of given her the same punishment after her medical condition improved. She is presently at the NCCIW in Raliegh, where I understand she will receive some medical attention, but will not be as closly monitored as she needs to be. My wife and myself are very concerned for her medical safely and feel that this prison sentence could have been delayed until she was stronger or that she could have received another form of punishment so that she would be able to receive the medical attention she needs. Thank you for your time. James Madel

Comment: I wanted to find out if the Governor will be granting early release for prisoners who are first time offenders. My son has served two and a half years of his five year sentence for armed robbery. He had never been in trouble before this incident. He has been infraction free for two years and was up for review this month at Tabor Correctional. Because of his unfair treatment since he got to Tabor he has been written up for two incidents. He has been having problems since he got to Tabor in October 2008. The staff are very unpleasant. This is the ONLY facility where my son has run into problems. Please look into this matter and let me know what I can do to have him transferred from this facility.

Subject: concern about the court system

Comment: I don't know if it's the court system I should be addressing or what. I just wanted to let you know how I feel on the way the law works. I was watching the news the other day and saw where two young men murdered a woman but got sent home with an ankle bracelet on. Yet, my son has been put in prison for a simple probation violation. The violation was not paying his probation officer and the fines that were set on him. With the economy the way it is it's hard to find a job. You know that. He didn't have a job and with no money coming in he couldn't pay those steep fines they place on people. It's just their way to get money out of the poor and they know it. My son was sent all the way to Neuse Correctional Institute in Goldsboro, NC to be processed and then will be sent to another prison for his term. We don't even know how long he'll be in there or where he'll be. My husband and I are disabled and can't get out and go any more. We are hoping he will be put close to home so at least one of us will be able to go visit him. I just don't think it's right for those two young men to be sent home for a murder and mine goes to prison for just probation violation. Do you think it's fair? My son't name is Stephen Kyle McPherson, birth date-9/19/81. He is at the Neuse Correctional Institute and his inmate number is 0709851. Please help us to get him close to home or even better home where we need him. Thank you and keep up the good work. Sincerely, Carolyn McPherson.

Ms. Paul,
The Governor's office referred your inquiry to the DOC, EEO office.  I have reviewed your concerns and it appears that Mr. Lamm handled the matter appropriately.  However, you mentioned harassment and/or hostile work environment.  If you feel you have been harassed or subjected to a hostile work environment,  you have the right to file an EEO complaint within the department.  Also, you can follow the instructions in the letter from Mr. Lamm to you dated 2/13/09, if you wish to appeal the demotion.

I hope this helpful, and if I can be of further assistance please contact me at (919) 716-3790.  Thank you.

Email: sherripaul@suddenlink.net

Subject: Judiciary

Comment: Good day. First, let me say congradulations on being the first lady governor for our state. I expect a good many changes will take place and I look forward to this from a woman's perspective. However, I do have a problem I would like to address with you or someone from your staff. I am secretary for the Superintendent of a prison facility in Eastern North Carolina. I have worked there for 4 Â½ years with Very Goods and Outstandings on my performance reviews and have not had disciplinary problems or infractions at any time. I have never caused problems nor ever had an internal investigation done on me. Recently, my doctor took me out of work for three days due to work related stress. While I was out, my office was entered, filing cabinets gone through and a mistake was found that I was not aware of until I came back to work. Due to this, an internal investigation was initiated by a Management Team member around December 1, 2008 due to my error. My statement says I made this error and I took complete responsibility for my mistake and oversight. I finally received the internal investigation results, January 16, 2009 and instead of a recommendation o f Unsatisfactory on my performance review and/or a Written Warning, the recommendation made was Demotion. There are various issues, including medical, with many doctors appointments in the past few months and there was nobody else trained to take over if I should need to be out for these appointments until December 2, 2008. I received these two major projects between March and May of 2008 and advised these were top priority. However, due to my mistake, my supervisor has said some very degrading, humiliating things to me during the course of this, which has been going on for a few months now, that I do not consider appropriate for a supervisor to say to any employee - in fact, based on our policy, a supervisor should never intimidate, degrade or humiliate an employee.... it is stressed you listen to your employee when there is a problem, ask for ways that it can be resolved, etc. I have tried several times in the past few months to talk with him concerning the overwhelming workload he has put on me because he wanted things to be right and he knew I could do it. My questions(s) is: do I have any grounds, as far as this Demotion referral, based on retaliation due to what happened will make him look inefficient with the state officials? Or would the derogatory remarks which has become his way of communicating with me be considered workplace harassment or a hostile work environment? There are other issues but I was just wondering about my rights as an employee with good work ethics, job skills, Outstanding performance record and no disciplinary actions. Another thing I wondered about is if I filed an EEO claim with the state department I work with, the outcome might not be fair to me because so many of these people have worked together for so long and it would be my word against his (he could have retired two years ago) and that kind of scares me because it might cause even more problems for me. Another thing is why a Management Team member within our facility was responsible for performing this investigation? Why was the Captain, who does internal investigations, not given this one or an outside, unbiased party brought in to conduct the investigation? To me, this seems to be a conflict of interest and therefore, the investigation may be biased. I bought a house two years ago, after my promotion. I am currently a pay grade 60, making only about $28,000 a year. If I am demoted, I will either have to sell my home, be foreclosed upon or file bankruptcy. I am single, live alone and have barely survived when the economy became so bad. I am too much of a perfectionist at work to make the kind of error I made. Therefore, I believe a demotion is a little steep after working hard to get where I am. I am human, as everyone else is, and do make mistakes. However, I do believe my supervisor/superintendent should have listened to me each time I talked to him about this, especially when I offered to take work home with me to get it done. He would not authorize this as he stated he would have to pay me. I told him I wasn't expecting to be paid, I just wanted to get caught up on all my priority duties for him so I would have more time during my workday to work on the two major projects he assigned to me. He has been aware I was behind in my work, almost from the very beginning. I was never behind before; therefore, I do not understand the demotion. Also, I received the results of the investigation Friday around 2:00, January 16th. The Pre-Disciplinary Conference for my side of the story is Tuesday at 9:00, January 20th. (Monday is a holiday). I do not know if this is standard procedure but this does not sound like enough time for me to get my information together, especially when most of my information that I need is at work. Am I supposed to use my time to prepare for this? That's why I believe it may be some type of retaliation as I may have possibly made him look bad with the officials in Raleigh. I am 45 years old and had a goal of finishing my psychology degree so I could become a Case Manager, then possibly continue on so I could become a Staff Psychologist. I know the superintendent was eligible for retirement two years ago. I would also like to say that my only child serves our country (Army). He just returned from a 15 month deployment on December 15, 2008. Any mother would worry about her son that is over in the war zone. I also understand he will probably be deployed to Afghanistan next. As a parent, I taught him to maintain good ethics, take responsibility for his actions but stand up for himself if he believes heâs right. Iâm very proud to say my son serves our country. You may contact me via email at sherripaul@suddenlink.net. I would appreciate a response and I thank you for your consideration and time in this matter. Sincerely, Sherri Paul

Hi â Mr. Helms sent this exact same email 257 times between 8:20am and 8:35am this morning. Thatâs excessive to say the least and in my opinion, bordering on abuse of the Governorâs email. Iâm copying the rest of our team on this in case Mr. Helms calls our office (if he hasnât done so already).



If you can expedite getting a response out on this one, that would help greatly.

Dear Mr. Meeks:



Governor Beverly Perdue forwarded your recent e-mail to the North Carolina Department of Correction Public Affairs Office for response. Thank you for your sharing your concerns about the possible closing of Wilmington Residential Treatment Facility. Your concern about the economic impact that the closing would have on your community is appreciated.



At this time the matter is being studied and recommendations are being made. The Department of Correction realizes that the targeted facilities provide many jobs and other economic benefits to the affected communities.  However, in making its recommendations, Department management will make what is felt to be the best use of available resources in serving citizens throughout the State.  The final decision will rest with the General Assembly.



Thank you again for your concern and interest.



Sincerely,



Marjorie Shahravar

Subject: Bryson City

Comment: Today my sister contacted me about a situation that I thought should be brought someones attention. Recently my brother Richard Keith Poe was released from prison. My brother is mentally unstable. I know this because he is my brother and has torchered and abused our family for years. He sexually molested several children when he was 13. He beat and choked my mother. He has abused every woman he has ever been with. I had him put in Broughton mental hospital once. His latest is my 85 year old father that he held a knife to his throat and told him he is going to kill him. After 2 days my sister called my father and he was able to tell her what was going on. She went with a sheriff to the house and took my father from there . The magistrate in Bryson city said they couldnt do anything because it had been 2 days since he did it. Well Richard has now gotten someone to take him to a truck stop close to where my sister lives. I feel your office needs to investigate why Bryson city isnt doing thier job. Richard has said on a number of times that he intends on killing his family. Someone need to do something before its to late.

Subject: GTL ADVANCE PAY- INMATE FAMILY PREPAY


I'm writing in regards to the new phone service that some prison inmates and their families are now being forced to use if they desire to hear from a love one. I my opinion this phone service is just another hardship given to inmates and families. I realize certain hardships are expected as it should be for rehabilitation purposes but to place this added burden on families is insensitive and uncaring to say the least. Do you even know how this service works? First of all, to even use this service families will need a credit card to set up a prepay account and they will be charged for using the service before a call is placed. My question to you is what possible reason do you havve for allowing this company to come and interrupt the services that were already in place? When advance pay was ask what would be the cost of each call they responded that they couldn't say at this time. Please tell me why this service is allowed in only some facilities and not others? My husband is currently an inmate at Maury Correctional and I have been told I can no longer have correctional billing services. Maybe this seems like a small issue to some of you but I assure you it is a real problem for those of us who are without the people we love and a phone call can mean so much. I would greatly appreciate it if you would do some research on this company mentioned or at the least offer families a better alternative.

Subject: GTL vs Correctional Billing

Dear Governor Perdue:
I need your help!! I'm not sure what department this falls under, so I am hoping you can help me, or route this letter to the appropriate personnel.
I received a pamphlet on GTL several days ago from my husband, Michael Lester, an inmate at Caswell Correctional Center. The pamphlet stated they are switching from Correctional Billing to GTL. For three days I tried to call the phone number for GTL, but could not get through. Last night I finally talked to a representative and I am extremely distressed!! I don't know why the state is switching to GTL but it willgreatly increase my financial burden and
 greatly decrease the phone service presently provided!

With Correctional Billing there is aflat $6.95 fee when I use my debit card to put money on my account. With GTL I am going to have to pay 19% of whatever I put on the account.

With Correctional Billing I can put as much as $200.00 on my account (at $6.95). The maximum amount I can put on my account with GTL is $110.00 (and pay 19% -$20.90) .

I just put $100 on my Correctional Billing account when I got paid last week. This money cannot be transferred to GTL and it will take 60 to 90 days for me to get a refund from Correctional Billing!
With Correctional
 Billing ther average cost per phone call is $3.15 for ten minutes. I asked how much the phone calls would be using GTL and the representative could not tell me! She said that I would have to wait until I get my first phone call, then I could call them and find out!!
Correctional Billing has an automaton system that will call me if my account gets below $20, giving me a chance to add money to the account and not have it blocked. The GTL representative said they do not do that.

Governor Perdue, I am very, very frustrated and stressed right now! My job is in jeopardy, as are thousands of other North Carolinians. It was announced last Monday that I am being forced to take a 5% pay cut effective March 1, 2009. And there is a chance that the company I work for will go out of business. Gas continues to go up! Groceries and everything
 else in my life is going up. And now this!
I respectfully request that you NOT switch to GTL, but keep Correctional Billing as the service provider. The switch will cause a hardship on all of the families that have loved ones in prison. It is vital to keep the lines of communication open with our loved ones in order to give them encouragement and hope.

Please reconsider the decision the decision to further increase my financial burdens.
Respectfully Submitted,
Wanda Ruth Lester

I informed the Health Services section of the Division of Prisons of your concerns and interest in this matter. It is my understanding that Mr. Hunt is being reviewed for Extended Limits of Confinement. If you have questions about this process, you may call Ms. Barbara Gardner at 919-838-4000.

Subject: Reduction in Sentence for Medical Reasons

Comment: My husbands best friend is in Central Prison. He has been transfered to Wake Med and in need of a heart and lung transplant. He was put back in jail for violating his parole because he went to work to help his terminaly ill father pay his bills instead of making it to his classes. His parole officer has stated that he wished he could have done more to keep him out but his hands were tied. Richard Lee Hunt is dying and his family is only permitted to see him 2 at a time 1 time a week. They are hoping that he will get better or atleast hold on long enough for everyone in the family to get to see him. His mother has suffered from a stroke and it is difficult for her to go and see him so far away. It will take 4 weeks just for all the family members to see him and that is only if his parents only see him the one time. Ricky was a model prisoner and is a new man. He deserves to be concidered for a reduction in sentence. It does not look good for him and his family would like to be able to spend what ever time he has left with him. There are many more factors to this story and I will be happy to tell you them. Please help me help his family. If there is nothing you can do please tell me who we need to contact to help his family have a little peace of mind before they loose their son, brother and father. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Dear Mr. Helms,

I am writing in response to your e-mails inquiring about the status of your brother Tim Helms.  Tim is currently housed in the hospital at Central Prison in Raleigh.

On August 3, 2008, while Tim was housed at Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville, he set a large fire in his cell.  When officers entered his blazing and smoke-filled cell, they found him lying on the floor and pulled him out.   He was seen by medical personnel shortly thereafter and appeared to have suffered only some minor scrapes in the incident.

In the days following that fire, Tim became ill and was hospitalized.  Medical confidentiality laws do not permit me to discuss his medical condition in detail with you.  Tim has not indicated any family contacts to be notified, and after the fire and onset of his illness, he said he did not wish to contact any members of his family.

If you wish to visit Tim at Central Prison you may contact the prison visitation office at (919) 715-2052 or CPVISIT@DOC.STATE.NC.US   Before visiting, you must first complete a visitor's application and submit that for approval.  Once approved as a visitor, you may schedule a visiting appointment.  The visitation office can advise you on this process.

Information you have received from other inmates regarding Tim being a witness to the death of inmate Ronald Burris is inaccurate.   At that time of that incident, which happened at Central Prison, Tim was located at a hospital in Greensboro, so it would not have been possible for him to have been a witness or had any involvement.

Additionally, there is no evidence to support any claim that Tim was beaten by officers while handcuffed.

Dear Ms. Huffman:



The Governor's Office forwarded your recent e-mail to the North Carolina Department of Correction. You are writing on behalf of Thomas Nunn # 0304573, asking for an "appropriate release date."



Mr. Nunn's conviction is under the Structured Sentencing Act, which eliminates parole for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. The Structured Sentencing Act mandates that the offender serve at least 100% of the minimum sentence and approximately 85% of the maximum sentence. Therefore, he must serve his sentence to completion. His current projected release date is 01/11/2014.



Post-Release Supervision is a period of supervision after completion of an active sentence and applies to offenders with felony B1-E class convictions. Mr. Nunn will also have nine months post-release supervision after completion of his active sentence.



If you have further questions or comments about Mr. Nunn's incarceration, please call me via our toll-free citizen's line at 1-800-368-1985.



Sincerely,

Thomas is now pulling his 7th year at Gaston Correctional Facitily and is doing very well.He has also gotten involue in a SAFE Program the last 3 years which has changed his life and made him a better preson.I feel that Thomas is ready to have a new life out here in the world with his 15 year old son that needs him more then anything right now.He also has alot of family and friends that really supports him and feels as if he deserves another chance with life.If you could possibly help us or give us directions on what to do we the family and friends would be very greatful. Thanks again for your time. Crystal Huffman

Dear Ms. Dyson:

The Governor's Office forwarded your e-mail to the North Carolina Department of Correction for response. You are asking for information early release for terminally ill prisoners based on recently passed legislation.

On June 10, 2008, Governor Easley signed <http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2007/Bills/Senate/HTML/S1480v5.html>Senate Bill 1480/Session Law 2008-2 into law creating a new provision for the medical release of certain inmates.

To qualify for release from prison under this law, inmates must be permanently and totally disabled, terminally ill or geriatric as defined in the law. The inmate must also be incapacitated to the extent that he or she does not pose a public safety risk.  Inmates convicted of <http://www.nccourts.org/Courts/CRS/Councils/spac/Documents/app-f07.pdf>class A, B1 and B2 felonies and those required to register as sex offenders under the <http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByArticle/Chapter_14/Article_27A.html>North Carolina Sex Offender & Public Protection Act are not eligible for release under this law. Inmates released under this law will be subject to supervision by the NC Division of Community Corrections.

I am also copying Ms. Barbara Gardner, Health Services Release Coordinator for the Division of Prisons, to inform her of your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

Marjorie Shahravar

DOC response from Anne Brown (Human Resources) is below:

Mrs. Olschner -
The agency is doing limited hiring of Correctional Officers.  The decision on when to hire is based on the needs of the prison.  We are not hiring for each vacancy that comes open, the way we would typically if there were not budget issues.  Each prison must operate with a limited number of vacancies.  When the number of vacancies can no longer be managed, approval for limited hiring is approved.  Unfortunately, in order to meet our budget targets, we are required to keep positions vacant longer than we prefer.

I looked on our applicant database and don't see an active application for your fiance.  In order for him to be eligible if any vacancies are approved to hire, he needs to fill out an up-to-date job application.  For other info on the hiring process, and to find out what tests he needs to take (if any), he should contact Jarlene Stuart at our Raleigh Regional Employment Office - 733-3336.

The address for the Raleigh Employment Office is:
4205 MSC
RALEIGH, NC  27699-4205

Here's the link for a blank job application (go to the bottom of the page):

Thank you for getting back to me.

His name is Mr. William Michael Fearns Jr. (Correctional Seargant PCI3980 FWM04 is his employee number).  He worked for Polk Correctional Institute for 5 years. Submitted his application and hit the freeze. He has spoken to Mr. Orwin and Mr. Rowland, both have expressed interest in him going back as bad as he wants to go back. Mr. Orwin has been helpful and has done everything possible but with the hiring freeze his hands are tied. Will is a veteran and would not require any training. All of his certifications are current. Everytime he calls the regional office or Polk he gets the run around. Anything you can do with assisting us would be wonderful.  Wills phone number is 919-349-8031 in case there are further questions.

As far as emailing. I have emailed so many people due to being desperate. Times are hard and were struggling. I went to governors website 2 times and emailed. I have gone to department of corrections website and emailed. I went to Department of Labor.  I never got a response but maybe you did not recieve it.

Thank you

Debra Olschner

It is really frustrating because he is a veteran and worked for the department of corrections for 5 years. He went out for knee surgery and went to go back, hit the freeze by three days. I so hope you can give me some idea. I tried emailing before and never got a response. That is definetely frightening in this time of need. Thank you, Debra Olschner

Dear Ms. Wyckoff,

Your email to the Governor's Office was forwarded to me for reply.  In your email (copy attached below) you wanted to know if ....."are there "witnesses" permitted to attend the hearing?"

The Parole Commission does not meet as a group in a formal hearing regarding parole.  The Commission does not meet with the offender. 

During the review process the public has the opportunity to appear before the Commission in Raleigh to present information they feel is important for the Parole Commission to consider. The meetings are held twice a month on Tuesdays, are 30 minutes each and are limited to five persons per scheduled appointment. There is a limited number of appointments available and they are scheduled on a first-come first-serve basis.  You should call me  at 919-716-3018 about 4 months prior to the offender's review date to schedule a meeting.

Additional information regarding sentencing and the parole process may be found at:
<http://www.doc.state.nc.us/FamilyServices/index.htm>http://www.doc.state.nc.us/FamilyServices/index.htm
Click on the "Handbook" link.

Feel free to contact me at 919-716-3018.

Dear Ms. McPherson:



Your e-mail has been forwarded to the NC Department of Correction for response. You are asking that your son be transferred closer to home to facilitate family contact.



In making housing assignments, the Department of Correctionâs first priority is to protect public safety by placing offenders in appropriate facilities and custody levels. Secondly, the department must also address issues of bed space, program assignment and court recommended treatment. While there is no such thing as a "hardship transfer," the department does consider the offenderâs request for assignment to facilities that facilitate family visits; however, these requests must balance with the aforementioned responsibilities. Your son should contact his case manager to discuss when he will be eligible to request a transfer.



Sincerely,




Marjorie Shahravar

Subject: I need your help!

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, I have sent you a message before about my problem, but now I really need your help. My son has been put in prison for a probation violation, which was just not paying his probation officer and fines. He didn't have a job and couldn't pay them. So they gave him time. He was sent to Neuse Correctional Institute in Goldsboro, NC for processing and we were hoping he would be put closer to home. His father and I are both handicapped and can't travel long distances. My husband had a stroke last May and had no use of his right side and I am in a wheelchair and can't walk. We were hoping our son would be put down at Anson Correctional in Polkton which is only a 25 minute drive from here instead he was put further away. He is in Dan River Prison Work Farm in Yanceyville, NC. We have no way of traveling and will have to try and find someone who can take my husband to see him because I can't get in and out of cars. I am homebound. We love our son and want to see him as much as we can but with the distance we can't. Please let me know if there is anything you can do or something we can do to get him closer to home so we can see him once in a while. Please! Someone told us about filing for hardship case but I don't know anything about that, but if it will help I'll do anything. If you know of anything to help please let me know. Thank you.

To Whom it may concern,



    I recently wrote an email concerning how Governor Perdue stands on Structured Sentencing.  I have gotten no response back on this matter.  I know when this was enacted, it was a good idea.  Now our prisons are over populated, and some are closing.  With the economy the way it is today, how can we fund the prison system to house all the inmates, when there is no room as it is.  More and more people are being incarcerated, and not many are being released.  The population is up to over 40,000.



    I am engaged to an inmate.  One of his friends asked him to pawn something because he didn't have his id. It was stolen.  Whe he was sentenced, he was given the term of seven years and six months to nine years and nine months, because of his prior history.  I'm not saying he shouldn't do the time for what it did because it was against the law.  But I think the time he got is a little harsh.  Seven and a half years to nine years nine months for a twenty dollar pawn ticket is crazy especially when he did not break into the house and did not steal what was pawned.  There are sex offenders and murderers that get less time than that. 



    Instead of giving everyone that comes to a sentencing hearing the same time as everyone else by what the judges have to go by.  We should go by the individual crime itself, because the longer an inmate is incarcerated, the harder it will be for them to find a job when they are released.  That means they will more than likely turn back to crime, and return to prison.  It's not "they are criminals, so they will return lets make them do more time", there are some really good people that do stupid things, yea they should do time but we shouldn't go to the extreme.



    We need to change this law, before you know it all of NC will be in the prison system.  Who will pay for the prison budget then.   Reduce time for good behavior, work time, etc.  Fifteen years of this is enough.







Thank you,

Tina Hall

Subject: Dying Prisoner

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing on behalf of my brother-in-law who is incarcerated at Lumberton (#1649) for using and selling a very small amount of drugs. His name is Darol Johnson and according to the doctors, he is dying. Lumberton is moving him tomorrow, Thursday, 26 February, back to Central Prison in Raleigh, where he will no doubt die without intervention. He nearly died last year. I believe the diagnosis is cystic fibrosis. I am requesting compassion for the family who lost a son/brother last May to death. If Darol could be released to die at home, it would give the family great peace. I have no idea how these things are done having no experience, personally, with prisons. But someone knows how to make this happen. Would you be willing to help the Johnson family with this? Darol's Mother is 96 years old and is still grieving the loss of the son last May. Thank you deeply for anything you can do. Sincere Regards, Diane M. Johnson

To Whom It May Concern:



My name Is Sean Taylor. I reside in  Raleigh. I read  Thursday, Dec 11 " Losing Track " article in the News and Observer regarding  the states probation system. I want to voice my  concerns with the system mainly regarding  the vacancy problem. I  tried to get a position as a probation officer only to be denied due to not having an college degree

However I  have worked in the law enforcement field in the  past and have taken the B.L.E.T. course.  I think if I have the proper training  and with my past experience I can be an effective officer. My concern is will having a college degree make a lot of difference in becoming a good probation officer. I have good judgment, and decisions making skills. I believe I have what it takes to be a  good probation officer. Thanks you for reading my comment.





Sincerely

Sean Taylor

Subject: probations

Comment: I have tried to get a response from my probation officer regarding my case. I was put on probation for a suspended sentence in 10/08. I was ordered to serve 10 days. I have served 3 days straight from court. I was given weekends to do the rest. I was turned away from jail every weekend I went to finish serving todate. My orginial PO is no longer with the dept(Pam Grissom) she assigned me 3 dates in Jan.09 to finish. I went and was turned away. I called the Probation office to report my efforts. The probation stated Pam Grissom was no longer my PO. I explained my problem about being turned away. They referred me to a new officer. I call his phone number and left several messages over a 2 wk period, no response. I reported for my next probation check in and was taken to jail and served one night and half a day until bail was posted. I have made all appts and reported to jail every Friday for months and was turned away. I want to finish my orginal punishment but now have a probation violation as result of a change in officers. My parents took me to jail everytime I was turned away. I have paid my fines. Please help me in this matter. ADam J Williams DOC # 0968042 district 10 unit a 9196255437

Mr. Taylor,

Thank you for your interest in working for the probation system.  In the state of North Carolina, probation officers must possess a Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university.  The reason for this is because probation officers are positions which are certified by the NC Criminal Justice Standards Division.  There is no equivalency for the degree.

You may consider applying for a correctional officer, which does not require a college degree.  Please check our web site for available openings.  Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office.
