Dear Ms. Hines:



Your email to Governor Purdue has been forwarded to me for a response.



I applaud you and your family for making the effort to attend your son’s graduation from Basic Training.  The State of North Carolina has no funds for this purpose.



I am sorry a more favorable answer can not be given.

[BAILOUT] 013:  Helping ourselves when no one else will
.
Do you ever get weary of listening to how billions are being thrown here, trillions there? Especially when it's your money -- to be paid off by us and future generations?
.
You could refuse to cooperate by going into poverty. OR you and your neighbors could start taking care of yourselves, the old fashioned way.  Here are 3 suggestions to jump-start your thinking about how to get America back to what it was for 2 centuries, before Wall Street pulled the plug on us.
.
While Congress Critters in Washington are pondering how to saddle us with a tax bill so large no one can imagine, we still have to live our lives, day by day. This is about friends and neighbors, and how we can pitch in where it matters, and celebrate better things in the meantime.
_______________________________________________
.
Proposition #1:  Music for the fun of it!
.
There's a pleasantly whacky bunch of folks down in North Carolina who are doing their own homegrown thing:  they want to set a new Guinness World Record -- with music.
.
Beginning March 19th, their plan is to gather as many musicians as possible for at least 9 days, in Statesville, near the center of NC.  24/7 nonstop music!  It's being done to raise money so their United Way will be able to help those who need help. And to have FUN!  Remember what plain old fashioned FUN used to be? You can be part of this, as a musician, or as a music fan. Musicians: register soon for best performance slots. For more info, contact Linda here: <mailto:lcanada777@aol.com>lcanada777@aol.com
.
Details are found on their pleasantly simple Website here: <http://www.statesvilleworldrecord.org/worldrecordconcert.html>http://www.statesvilleworldrecord.org/worldrecordconcert.html
.
______________________________________________
.
Proposition #2:  Art for a toxic bailout
.
You may have heard about the 3-day-before-Christmas Toxic Coal Ash Spill from a TVA Power Plant Lagoon over in eastern Tennessee.  It's worse than an oil tanker spill. TVA, politicians and the media are trying to downplay it as much as they can.  But there's a brave band of Volunteers working day by day to improve the lot of those who have to breathe and drink toxic chemicals leaching from this Toxic Coal Ash, spreading thru the air and down waterways. It got loose, and it can't be stopped.
.
These brave souls put their own health at risk for others, and will accept any help they are offered, especially for much needed respirators and other essential supplies.  
.
Here's another self-help idea they're working on, still in it's infancy, but looks good. The coordinator of clean up Volunteers wanted some artists to help by creating art that could be used on flyers and announcements, to help attract support. They call themselves the TN Coal Ash Survivors Network, assisted by United Mountain Defense.
.
That request was sent around as a [Toxic Art] Email, and brought in offers. Artists from distant places wanted to help. An idea formed that they could donate work for an Exhibition to raise money by sale of their work. Rhone County where the spill occurred is rural, but only 30 minutes from Knoxville by Interstate. 
.
So, here's the deal, subject to change with Volunteer input.  Beginning April 1st, an Exhibition is being planned to coincide with the already popular Dogwood Arts Festival held every April in Knoxville.  A Silent Auction will be held on April 30th.  All proceeds to go directly to help Survivors Network and UMD.
.
There's a lady nearby who's been coordinating national Email for these groups. She has experience with Silent Auctions and has agreed to coordinate Volunteer efforts of artists nationwide who want to contribute. Her name is Mary, and here's her Email addy: <mailto:marytheprez@yahoo.com>marytheprez@yahoo.com
.
The following are welcomed from any artists anywhere. Contact Mary for details.
> Artwork donations for the Silent Auction. May or may not be about the disaster. An Artist's bio should be supplied with donations, which will help showcase those who contribute.
> Images that may be used graphically to call attention to disaster relief efforts. Artists will be given credit for works used.
> And of course, any direct assistance in planning and assembling this Exhibit is welcomed.
.
This is a real homegrown self-help project coming together as you read this. Tennessee is known as the Volunteer State, and these Volunteers are proving again why it is. A name for this benefit Art Exhibit is being sought.  It might include the word Volunteer, but it shall NOT include TVA in its title. Words suggesting hope and renewal would work well. Short and catchy is best. 
.
You may volunteer your suggestions for this volunteer art exhibit to the volunteer coordinator, Mary at <mailto:marytheprez@yahoo.com>marytheprez@yahoo.com
.

________________________________________________
.
Proposition #3:  Plant a Victory Garden!
.
Wherever you are, it's not too late to start planning an old idea that needs dusting off and brought back to life once again.  Victory Gardens helped get Americans thru the adversity of WW II. Their predecessor Gardens helped our grandparent's generation thru our last Great Depression. 
.
It doesn't have to be huge or spectacular. I made mine last year as a 2' wide strip up against a south facing garage, with permission from my landlord.  This Winter, I've been slowly hand turning more ground along an adjacent fence line, tripling its size. Two of my neighbors helped get it started last year, and more are dumping their fruit and vegetable scraps into a simple compost bin made from an old crate. Our few hand tools came cheap from an overstock discount store.
.
This Winter, I've been watching the snow melts, to see where sun and shadows create warm and cool spots. Cool for lettuce, warm for tomatoes, peppers and zucchini.  Snow peas to climb strings tacked to the back wall, reachable as tomato vines will begin to climb inside columns made from a discarded roll of hog wire fencing. You get the idea: you don't have to spend very much.
.
With a little TLC, you'll probably have a bounty to share with others. Or invite neighbors to join you. Nothing beats building community spirit like a Community Garden.  Think you don't know enough to start?  Your Public Library is overflowing with books to help, free for the asking. 
.
Gadget minded?  Here's an amazing Website of folks who figure out how to build anything from anything laying around, and share it, including compost bins: <http://www.instructables.com/>www.instructables.com/
.
[I once visited a garden on a harsh shaley slope in Yukon Canada. The lady had terraced it, fed nutrients from plant scraps and a little fertilizer, and chose plantings that would fit her climate. This was in early June, when their Spring had just begun. She started her tomatoes in cans indoors, well ahead of when they could be put outside. She convinced me by her example that there is no place that cannot support growing a Garden, if you put your mind to it! ]
.
Besides the bonus of having nutritious fresh-grown food to eat, a Garden will force you off your couch and out into the real world, connecting with Nature in ways that feed your spirit as well. And it's a great learning experience if you have kids or grandkids.
.
Adversity forces us back to basics. It's all part of learning how to take care of ourselves!

Dear Mr. Cooper,

Your email has been forwarded to me for a response.  I have not received information on the issue that you addressed, but there may be pending legislation that I am not aware of.  Third District Congressman Walter B. Jones is a member of the Armed Service Committee in the US House of Representatives.  I suggest that you call Congressman Jones’s office in Greenville and inquire of the issue.  You can call him at (800) 351-1697 or (252) 931-1003 and ask to speak to Jason.  Jason is responsible for military and veterans issues for the Congressman.

Visitor: Mr. Dan Cooper

Address: 1120 Riggs Rd, Maysville, NC 28555

Email: dcooper2@ec.rr.com

Subject: MILITARY BENIFITS

Comment: I have copied and pasted an e-mail I recieved and am trying to confirm if it is true. It is under Chapter 9, Option 96. They are trying to screw us even more. Give us a raise and take it away with the other hand. Looks like our future pres is about to put the screws to the military retirees. The veterans will be next, then the active duty military. Heads Up, The Fight For Our TriCare Heath Care... is on the front burner to be cut... We all need to get involved with this, if we don't we all will be at fault. Please read everything below. Thank you Dean and others that send me items to pass on to all of the rest of the MilVets that are on this list. Subject: FW: TriCare for Life's Future Date: Thu, 8 Jan 2009 09:14:10 -0800 To All, This is for real. The heavy assault has begun on Veterans'/Retirees' benefits to pay for other programs. The word on the street is that these indeed are a high priority of the Obama administration. The one most of interest to Retired Military is in Article 189. If approved by Congress the first assault wave would hit the beaches in 2011 and would hit hard. It would initiate cost sharing to require retirees to pay the first $525 of medical cost and 50% of the next $4,725 for a first year cost of $2,888 per person. It would be indexed to increase with inflation. A reason given for this action (for PR effect) is "overuse" by Retirees. Clyde ________________________________ For those of you who are covered by TFL you will want to pay attention to what BG Bob Clements has surfaced about the future of TFL. If you know of anyone who is Retired Military, please forward this on to them. I don't know how many of you partake of the TriCare for Life program but here is a very interesting note on the subject. Seems as though our President Elect has placed a priority on cutting it out of the budget as a means to provide funding for those things he promised during the campaign. In any case, on page 189 of the Congressional Budget Office report, see the note below on how to get to that spot, there is a strong recommendation to eventually eliminate the program as it is too expensive. I would ask that you contact your elected officials and register your strong opposition to the elimination of this program. Just another move to slight those of us who dedicated much of our adult lives to the defense of our country. Thanks for listening.

Comment: Hi, I have tried to find out about my dad signing up my mom for SBC benefits. I have not been able to get an answer or a live human at the VA to find out when "Open Season" is so that he can sign up my mom (his wife). Would you be able to let me know? Thankyou in advance Your constituant Debbie Walston-Krevdo

I talked with Ms. Walston-Krevdo and found out that the program that she was inquiring about is a DOD program for military retirees.

Her father and mother live in Florida.  I referred her to a Military Retiree Affairs Office or the Defense Finance and Accounting Office.

I don’t believe that they can help her father and mother because they have waited to many years to apply.
