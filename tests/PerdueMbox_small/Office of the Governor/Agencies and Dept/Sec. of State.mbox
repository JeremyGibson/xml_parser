Subject: concern about lobby violations, nonprofit fraud



Dear Governor Perdue,



You might not remember me, but I am the former head of Common Cause, NC a
group that was a government watchdog, especially related to lobbying and
campaign finance here in NC. I am now a semi-retired private citizen.



I am writing because I am concerned that Garo Alexanian, a non-resident who
heads the Companion Animal Network out of New York, may be violating NC
state and federal nonprofit, tax and lobby laws by:



    - not being properly registered as a lobbyist and other violations of
our lobby laws

    - not being properly registered as a nonprofit or business

    - not  having a NC charitable solicitation license while raising funds
in our state

    - misrepresenting his organization while soliciting contributions

    - improperly funneling funds through another nonprofit

    - not filing proper organization papers or tax returns (no 501c4, c4 or
business license)

    - not reporting all income



You can find details about these concerns in the attachment to this email.



This might be of concern to you, Governor, because he appears to claim you
as a supporter.



The issue Mr. Alexanian is lobbying for is animal shelter euthanasia.  He is
pushing HB27, which is competing with HB6, Davie's Law, named after a dog in
Davie County that survived gassing.  Davie's Law bans gas chambers entirely,
and is endorsed by the national and state Humane Societies, the Animal
Control Association, 39 other NC animal groups. HB27 does not ban gas
chambers and has no reputable endorsements. (See attached.)   Mr. Alexanian
has been recruiting average citizens like me, as well as community leaders,
by using vague words and refusing to release basic information, so they
don't know what they are supporting.  You may be one of his victims. Once
one of his bill sponsors and three co-sponsors were alerted to this, they
withdrew their names.



This has caused mass confusion, which just hurts the cause of ending gas
chamber use, yet Mr. Alexanian has refused to work with state groups here on
this; moreover, he actually threatens and tries to intimidate us North
Carolinians (and has been reported to authorities for that).



Worse, if he IS found guilty of lobby, solicitation and nonprofit law
violations, he will drag down well-meaning legislators with him.  That's not
good for anyone.



However, this issue also brings to the surface the problems of our current
lack of ability to find and monitor non-registered lobbyists.  Many people
are being paid to lobby at the legislature without being registered. I know
this because I met them all the time at the legislature. (I also met
lobbyists who complained that they weren't getting enough from legislators
for their campaign contributions, that they really didn't need the corporate
welfare checks they were asking for, and all manner of wrongs.)  Right now,
there's absolutely no way for the government or public to know about them as
it can only monitor activities of registered lobbyists.



If legislators and Council of State were required to keep a log of all
contacts, much like they do with campaign contributions, that was made
public, it would be much easier to keep track.



My concerns about Mr. Alexanian not being properly registered as a nonprofit
or charitable solicitor also is representative of the lack of oversight of
nonprofits in general.  I know from working in the nonprofit world for years
that embezzlement is rampant. Most nonprofit boards have no idea how to read
financials, and if they do, don't take the time to read them carefully. (I
myself found embezzlement within Common Cause, a group that banks it's
reputation on being clean.)  They also keep very poor books.  While some are
required to file income reports with IRS, there is no outside audits, not
way to know whether they are reporting ALL income.



(You may recall that last year, a New Bern church had no choice but report
the hundreds of thousands lost--but they knew about it before charges were
filed.)



My guess is that many don't report.  They also don't report embezzlement
when found because it will hurt their fundraising efforts, so the
perpetrators go from one group to another. Any nonprofit receiving
government funds should be required to have an external audit.



It's bad enough that Mr. Alexanian, a non-resident, has come here to lobby
for a law we don't want and  threatens our citizens.  Violating the sacred
trust we place in charitable organizations and thumbing his nose at our new
lobby laws would be altogether too much.



Therefore, I respectfully request that you, Governor:



    - publicly endorse Davie's Law

    - assist in getting Davie's Law introduced in the Senate

    - call for an investigation of this man and his organization related to
lobby, nonprofit and solicitation         laws

    - establish a method of identifying all non-registered lobbyists

    - establish better oversight of nonprofits operating in our state, to
include external audits.

       (If cannot do all of them, at least those receiving  government
funds),



If you would like to discuss these items or any further information, please
contact me at this email address or call 919 518-6923.



Sincerely



Carol Love
