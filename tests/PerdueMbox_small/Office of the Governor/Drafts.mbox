Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

‚ÄúThe leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúI look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayers‚Äô dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.‚Äù

The commission‚Äôs first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the state‚Äôs entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The commission members include:

Co-chair Norris Tolson ‚Äì Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland ‚Äì Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.

Norma Houston ‚Äì Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.

Dan Gerlach ‚Äì Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.

Curtis Clark ‚Äì Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditor‚Äôs Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;

Charlie Sanders ‚Äì Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.

Ron Penny ‚Äì Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.


$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced†Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.† The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolina‚Äôs Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.† About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.† The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

‚ÄúThis project is big a win for North Carolina.† It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolina‚Äôs congressional delegation.† Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation.†

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.† The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.† Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.† Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work†will begin in April on the state‚Äôs first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

‚ÄúThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,‚Äù Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met ‚Äúgood faith effort‚Äù requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th.†

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the state‚Äôs fourth oldest bridge still in use.

Dear Governor Perdue;

The hottest thing to come along in years is the motorized bicycle, sometimes referred to as "power-assisted vehicles", "human-electric hybrids", "pedelecs" (for pedal electric cycles) combine the driver's pedaling with a motorized assist from a rechargeable electric battery, which can be plugged into any standard AC outlet.† This is in contrast to mopeds or motorcycles, which run on gas and have environmentally polluting combustion engines like those in cars. The rider turns the electric assistance on or off using a toggle or a twist of the handle grip and can choose and entirely electric ride, an entirely pedaled ride or a ride combining electric with pedal power.

Great America Electric Bicycle Company (GAEBC) was formed to offer the public and exciting new mode of transportation for the family and commuter - electric bicycles and scooters.† On December 9, 2002 President George W Bush signed into Public Law PL107-319, which defined a low-speed electric bicycle as any bicycle with fully operable pedals, and electric motor not exceeding 750 Watts (1 H.P) of power and a top motor-powered speed not in excess of 20 miles per hour.† An electric bicycle, scooter or tricycle that meets these limitations is regarded as a bicycle.† This law places electric bicycles under jurisdiction of the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) rather than the Department of Transportation (DOT).† In North Carolina a driver's license is not required, and the bicycle/scooter/tricycle does not have to be registered, inspected or covered by liability insurance.† A helmet is required by law in North Carolina.† The motor cannot exceed 750 Watts have an external shifting device or the capability of exceeding 30 miles per hour on a level surface.

Great America Electric Bicycle Outletis a licensee of GAEBC and opened a retail store in beautiful Historic Downtown Apexon Salem Street and has the largest inventory of Electric Scooters, Bicycle's and Tricycles in North Carolina.† They offer a wide range of electric bicycles that will meet the need of every person.† They include electric bicycles, scooters, fold-able bicycles,†mountain bicycles and†three wheeled tricycles ranging from 180 watts 36 volt 12 AH, to 750 Watt 60 volt 20 AH models.††Our bicycles travel between 20 and 30 mph taking you effortlessly around town, to your place of work or just on a leisurely ride with your children.† There are 11 models to choose from in a variety of new exciting colors that will be sure to get you noticed around town.† Most models come standard with an audible motion sensor alarm and remote control key fob, for your security.† Forget about gasoline and maintenance. Electric bicycles can scoot around town with 40 miles between charges and recharge in less than 6 hours.† The batteries are recharged at the same cost as running a small electric light in your home.†

At Great America Electric Bicycles Outlet outstanding customer service along with a superior product is there number one priority.††We have a Gold Key Service Department, carry every part available and have a 2 year warranty on the motor and battery.††Our electric bicycles meet the requirements of Energy Star Complying Green Products, as defined by US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Department of Energy.† Non -polluting and low noise requirements.†

We would like to invite you to take a test drive today!†

I would be happy to bring an assortment of my electric bicycles to† the Governor's office so†you can see for yourself how†you

save the public money by going green while having a great time.†

I look forward to meeting you.

Dear Mr. Benton,

I am writing to you to share an idea that could provide some very needed resources in North Carolina's information infrastructure.† The project could be folded into the community college system to provide training, the jobs created could be done by many people from their homes via internet, and the jobs would be white-collar and sustainable.†

The idea comes from my brother who has been working for a company, CCS Ltd., that helps institutions and governments digitize archives and other tectual materials which they must preserve by law and which provides some added benefits in terms of access and cost of movement.† Recently, after establishing archives thru-out Scandinavia and Europe, the government of Norway came back and asked their entire government forms and documents undergo the same process.† CCS provides software which reformats the data into an internationally accepted format according to access standards for various archives established by the Library of Congress.† Norway reasoned that to preserve their history and culture, they had to make it easily accessible and with a broad enough subject area to attract outside researchers.† North Carolina could also do the same by preserving all the rapidly disappearing newspapers and journals and making them accessible across the Internet.† This would also be†true of the many important documents of its citizens for historians, not to mention the many forms and documents currently being used and laborously accessed thru manual means which are also very expensive to mail.†

CCS is in this business for the long-haul and can help North Carolina set up its own digitizing center to digitize very large volumes of pages that can be centrally accessed and in an internationally accepted format that can be easily supported by many rapidly changing technologies.† This†has been done by the British Library, Library of Congress, and many other archives thru-out the world.† North Carolina could take the leadership in the US and could also create 250 sustainable jobs in a center digitizing over 300,000 pages a year.†

I know how strapped State governments are for cash right now but I really think this project is just as important as building roads and bridges.† This is our history we are talking about!† Current State government operations could also benefit in providing central access to all forms, preserving them, and storing them for less cost.†

My brother and I would be happy to discuss this further with you and your representatives and putting together a project that could meet your specifications.† I have attached one reference and can provide several more.† Please give us a call.

Subject: Response from DHHS/DMA to a "Governor's Inquiry"



Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,



I am writing on behalf of Margaret Hiatt and her three sons.† I have been trying to intervene on their behalf†to secure Medicaid Waiver, CAP-MR/DD, services.† I believe they are not unique and other families are having the same problem.† I have tried to suggest that a simple exception can be made for all of the families who have more than one adult residing in the home and receiving CAP-MR/DD services.† If DHHS/DMA/DMHDDSAS truly believe that the Comprehensive Waiver that became effective 11/1/08 does not allow for any exceptions, then why are they not considering a simple Technical Amendment?†



Here is the relevant language from the waiver document (top of Page 9 of 189):



The #0662 Comprehensive Waiver will offer adult participants the opportunity to choose their parents, guardian of the person or other family member to provide a daily service through a Home Supports service definition. Home Supports will be similar to Residential Supports which is provided in the group homes.†Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.

> NOTE BY MARY SHORT (1/13/09):† In the above paragraph, please be aware that Residential Supports is provided in GROUP HOMES.† Meaning, that the provider is paid for MORE THAN ONE individual to provide a 24-hour service to each individual.† Because Medicaid is billed for "1 unit" of service (24 hours equals 1 unit),†a provider who has†4 residents†can bill 4 units a day without violating Medicaid billing rules.† And that is necessary because a provider may take a resident to a medical doctor who is also going to bill Medicaid for "units" of†services within that same 24-hour period.


A Technical Amendment (TA ... and there were four TA's to the previous waiver) would be quite simple:†



Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.† However, parent(s) who reside with more than one adult child may provide Home Supports in the same manner as Residential Supports are provided in group homes OR alternative services of Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services may be provided in conjunction with others not living with the participants.



All my suggested TA does is return these families to hourly services to be provided by either the parent(s) or other staff, related or unrelated, living with or not living with.† And as hourly services, any one person would not bill for more than 16 hours a day!† And as hourly services, any one person could work in any combination needed amongst all the CAP-MR/DD recipients in the home!



I am not shocked by the attached response (see Word file attached).† This is consistent with my attempts at suggesting the above alternatives.† DMA/DMHDDSAS completely refuse to acknowledge there is anything they can do to fix the problem.† And please, please understand that "a plan of care and appropriate services have been developed to meet the needs of all three of your sons" is only PART of the truth!† Ms. Hiatt has been told she had NO ALTERNATIVE.† I have no idea what other families have been told.† I truly don't believe there are more than 35 families who would need this exception or TA.



Please, Gov. Perdue or Sec. Cansler contact me as soon as possible so that we can work toward getting these families the simple services they ALL had under the previous waiver!† I have Ms. Hiatt's permission to release information.†

Subject: Vanpooling in Wake County

Hi Bev,
Welcome to office.  I look forward to all the tremendous things you will accomplish while in office.  I wanted to bring the following to your attention.  In an effort to continually reduce my carbon footprint, I went to the Triangle Transit website today with the interest of joining a vanpool.  To my surprise, none exist for my current route.  So, being a concerned citizen, I wanted to start one.  Well, this is the message at the top of the TTA vanpool page.
Current Routes - We're Sorry Triangle Transit is currently out of vans, but is working hard to get more soon. In the meantime, please contact VPSI, Inc.<http://www.vpsiinc.com>
I find this rather disturbing.  Out of vans?  A 5,000 dollar used work van I'm sure is not a budget breaker for the State Government.  Can we look into getting some more vans for the fine folks at Triangle Transit in order to reduce emissions in Wake County?

Dear Governor Purdue,
††† I see by your schedule, that you have a Senior Staff Meeting, you are to meet with The Cabinet Secretaries, and finally, you have a Recovery Meeting, to close out your day, Monday.
††† I am asking that you take the time to discuss in these meetings, a re-assumption of the Natural Authority, vested in the State, as per the Tenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, to offset the offensive presumptuous taking of power which has been done by Congress, to the whole Nation's detriment.
††† While the media and the left clamor about the failure of capitalism, and the "mess left by the previous administration", every rational economist knows for a fact, this entire meltdown is the result of almost ninety years of playing around with monopoly money instead of real currency, and it has been brought to it final edge and pushed over, by the affirmative action lending practices, forced on banks by Congress in its many unfunded mandates, which, by the way, created the two primary entities responsible for creating all the "toxic assets" by allowing bad credit to be "bundled" with good, I'm speaking of Fanny Mae, and Freddy Mac, the two most egregious offenders of mortgage law ever created.
††† Governor Purdue, almost every facet of the federal government that has come to life since the second world war, came about to take over a function previous handled just fine by the States, the counties and districts, and the local boards of education and other†such types of municipal boards.
††† We are no less capable of doing this, than were our grandfathers, and it is absolutely certain we can do it for a whole lot less, here at home, than anyone can do it for us, in Washington D.C.† It is long overdue for all the States to recognise the limits that "the natural law of diminishing returns" exposes in any complex system, and return to a system sized small enough that it is efficient, and doesn't spend four times as much on bureaucratic pay, than it does on the object of the program.
††† Governor Purdue, it is time for us to devolve the massive overgrown federal government, which has grown so large its left hand never knows what its right hand is doing, and revert to the Constitutionally limited government, The Republic delineated in the Constitution, as the founders intended, and in fact, return to being Sovereign Citizens, in charge of our own destinies, as any free people are.
††† Please take the time to address this before your meetings, and try to get the concept that we once were a "Sovereign State", in the same way Poland, France and Germany are, and at that time, we were a part of a federal system only for such things that were beyond the ability of the "several states" to effectively accomplish without coordination.
Sincerely,

> I am sorry to bother you but at this time I do not know where to turn.  I am from Lincoln Nursing Center a nursing home in Lincolnton.  We often admit residents from Gaston County that apply for Medicaid.  As of now we currently have two residents we are losing substantial amounts of money on.    In both cases it was the responsibility of the case workers to tell us what was needed.  In both cases we talked to the case workers often and even today spoke with the one handling this last case and she said everything was fine.  It would be approved but now she is calling asking for another FL2.   We will at least lose 3 months of care.  This seems to be a recurring incident with your caseworkers.  Melissa spoke with Angela Sanford and her response "in a perfect world"  we would have been notified that this information was needed.  Also, in her remarks, we should know what they needed?  I'm sorry but I am not a case worker and we did provide everything needed at the time of application.

> We are appealing the first case and we will appeal this case when and if the resident is approved.  It is their right to have Medicaid coverage and they are doing an injustice to their clients.

Subject: Recovery Act funds

Comment: The purpose of this message is to encourage you to consider using a portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) money to initiate, restore, protect or expand the National Board Certification program in your jurisdiction. National Board Certification is a proven program to improve teacher effectiveness that has strong federal support at the highest levels. We believe that National Board Certification helps fulfill the basic educational services that are a civil right of our children. In particular, the National Board's Targeted High Need Initiative (THNI) is designed to increase the number of National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) working in high-need schools and is strongly aligned with President Barak Obama's priority to ensure the equitable distribution of high quality teachers. During the press conference announcing the nomination for U.S. Secretary of Education, both Arne Duncan and President Obama endorsed National Board Certification as an integral factor in the highly touted education reform effort in Chicago. Further, during his confirmation hearing, Secretary Duncan mentioned National Board Certified Teachers as contributing to his success as CEO of Chicago Public Schools. Why do President Obama and Secretary Duncan hold the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards in such high regard? Because it works. In June 2008, the National Research Council of the National Academies issued a congressionally-mandated report that stated, "The evidence is clear that National Board Certification distinguishes more effective teachers... with respect to student achievement." Other studies have found: Students of NBCTs generally outperform students of non-NBCTs on standardized tests. Students of NBCTs scored 7 to 15 percentage points higher on year-end tests than students of non-NBCTs. These studies also show that minority students benefit even more from instruction by NBCTs. In one large-scale analysis of more than 100,000 student records, students of NBCTs - particularly African American and Hispanic students - made larger score gains on mathematics tests than students taught by non-NBCTs. Students of NBCTs make learning gains equivalent to an extra month in school. National Board Certified Teachers do more than just improve test scores. Standardized tests do not gauge how well a student explores or expresses new ideas - skills that reflect higher-order thinking and that can be developed by high-quality teaching. Studies show that students with NBCTs improve in terms of "deep" learning - the kind of higher-order thinking that policymakers and business officials say is needed for a successful workforce. The federal government has stepped in to provide more than $130 billion for education through passage of the Recovery Act. Almost immediately, money will be distributed to the states and school districts to meet a number of critical needs. Although there will be some flexibility on how the money can be spent, there will also be very stringent accountability regarding those expenditures. Title II, Part A-5, section 2151(c) of the U.S. Elementary and Secondary Education Act already recognizes the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards as an eligible entity for federal funding. The needs are great, the demands urgent, and the stakes have never been higher. As you decide on the best way to allocate these resources, you can rest assured that National Board Certification represents a sound, fiscal investment in our future. When the U.S. Department of Education issues guidance and regulations regarding the dissemination of the funding under the Recovery Act, we will update you on specific ways that you can use the money for National Board programs. For more information, see: The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 http://www.nbpts.org/userfiles/File/RecoveryActSummary_03032009.pdf The video, "National Board Certification-Excellence, Leadership, Results" http://www.nbpts.org/about_us/nbpts_video If you have questions, or would like more information, please contact: Anna Davis, Executive Director for Government Relations, National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, at RecoveryAct@nbpts.org.

Ladies & Gentlemen:

On March 6, 2009. I filed an unemployment claim due to a pay cut, the result of lack of business and business changes with my previous employer.† As a result, the cost to travel as an interstate sales person exceeded income.† I have been looking for employment daily, filed 4 weekly certifications and made over 50 attempts to reach a processing representative.† On Wednesday, April 8th, I reached a customer service representative, Ruby, who advised I contact the processing center because my previous employer had not responded to your office by the required†deadline of 3/23/09.† After numerous attempts I spoke with Ferris in customer service on Friday, 4/17 and was advised of several claim options requiring resolution.† Until this point, other than filing the requested direct deposit option, I had no contact with your office,†† Ferris explained that the office was short staffed, trainees were had been hired but was not able to give an exact date of determination to receive benefits.† He stated that I was approximately "half way through the process" and the "incoming legal department" would review my claim.† Unfortunately, I have now been unemployed over 6 weeks and my claim is now over 5 weeks old with no resolution.†Additionally, I have no income and relying on NCESC to process my claim and deposit appropriate funds.† Since filing, I am now residing in Arizona†anticipating at least temporary and hopefully full-time employment with benefits.††

Senator & Governor, NCESC, please advise of determination.† This is a very tough time and I would have assumed North Carolina would have been able to assist residents in a timely fashion.† I need your assistance, please.††Should this be beyond your control please advise which steps I should take to advance my claim.

Thank you,

†Congratulations on winning the Governor's race and for the honor of being the first female Governor of North Carolina. I know you are very busy right with just starting this position and with the economy so I am going to make this a brief note. Around where we live in Reidsville there are not a lot of available jobs. Some of my family and a few of my guy friends are looking for full time work with some security. A few of them have put in applications with the state to hopefully gain employment with one of the correctional facilities near us. That a secure job. There will always be prisons.†We know because of friends that work in the one in Yanceyville, that they need officer help bad. My question is do you think the freeze on these jobs will be lift anytime in the near future? This will fill positions that are there and available and will get a few more people back in the workforce and in full time jobs and off the unemployment line like the President, You and all of America is striving for. Thank you so much for your valuable time and waiting to hear soon when this freeze may be lifted. Again Thank you very much.††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Angela Owens

Subject: Unemployment and immigration

Dear Governor Perdue:

Current NC unemployment has reached 9.7%. †It will probably go higher.

In 2007 I chaired our countyís Blue Ribbon Committee on Illegal Immigration; a somewhat feisty experience, to put it mildly. †However, a good deal of learning occurred for all involved.

Some of the information included the fact that even though agricultural jobs were advertised, there were few if any applicants. †This happened in our county when unemployment was 3+%. †It also happened in California as documented by Senator Feinstein. †And a Princeton professor wrote that even at $25/hour there would be a paucity of applicants from the US native labor pool (and at much higher wages more farming, and therefore farming jobs, would move OUT of the USA!). †In addition, a minister on our committee reported that in counseling unemployed church members, those folks confessed that they would rather stay on unemployment (and in some cases moonlight) than work for around $12.00/hour.

HOWEVER, we are in different times with unemployment 3 times what it was 2 years ago. †Therefore, I urge you make every effort to assure that all so called low-skilled jobs, including ag jobs, are posted early through the stateís Employment Security Offices so that our NC US citizens have first crack at them. †I also recommend your office give full publicity to this action.

We will see how many unemployed (especially white collar) workers sign up to pick crops, clean motel rooms, etc. during these trying times. †Iíd love to be surprised. †

Frankly, even in these trying times, I believe there is a need for a guest worker program that meets market demands and is better administered. †But, Iím very willing to be proven wrong.

Sincerely,

Bob

Subject: DOC Employees and Proposed Prison Closures

March 14, 2009


RE.: Prison Closure Proposals


Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

††††††††Almost 27 years ago I left Germany and arrived here in the United States of America with my most priced possessions packed in to one suitcase†and I have lived in North Carolina ever since.† I am a single mother of two beautiful children, which attend UNC Charlotte and Methodist University.† My life has not been easy and I lost my first born to SIDS almost 28 years ago.†I had to work hard for what I have now and I also had to†struggle to be able to hold on to it.† My husband abandoned us in 2005 after 18 years of marriage without a plausible reason and he made sure to clean out the bank accounts and take all the kids college money as well.††I raised my son and daughter to be law abiding citizens and to study hard to be able to make something out of their lives and to contribute to society by helping others.† I†attended Fayetteville Technical Community College†and by†the end of 2005 I had earned two†associates, one in Paralegal Technology and one†in General Education but since my husband abandoned us and left us penniless I had to take the first job that was available to have some income coming into my household and† I started working for the Department of Correction, McCain Correctional Hospital, as of April 16, 2006.††I first worked as Medical Records Assistant III and I moved up to Office Assistant†IV†within one year.†I work hard everyday and in the 21 months in my new position I have covered my old position for more than 8 months†for various reasons and I have also trained two new employees in this position as well† and without ever getting any†additional compensation.†I believe in teamwork and I am a team player and a hard worker that helps anyone in†need of assistance and to keep†the workflow going to accomplish the departments day-to-day operations and mission of the department.† All in all, I take pride in all the work that I do†because what I do
does not only reflect on the people and†the department I work for but it also reflects on me.††I know I have much†more potential†than to work for the NC DOC but it is not easy to find a good job in North Carolina without having certain connections that others seem to have.†

††††††††Now we are slated to be closed and morale at McCain is very low.† Most workers here are minorities, women, people of different national origin, most are older than forty, and we have many single parents as well.†††The other facts†are that most employees here†only have a High School Diploma and†some do not even have that and the income of DOC employees is the lowest†pay†of all State Departments and most†have to work second jobs to be able to make ends meet. †All of us are devastated†and scared†and there is a great fear that we will not be placed in other state positions and that therefore our†children will suffer.† The fear of being unemployed and of losing our homes and not being able to take care of our children is more than we can bare.† We do not understand why we are being slated to close while monies are being paid to six figure positions on the top of the hill and other monies are being made available for, Goodyear incentives, probation, community college staff and faculty raises, and teacher ABC raises while we will be losing our lively hood.† The†Federal Stimulus†Package†is, and†was, supposed to save†and/or create 105,000 jobs, and not to shift money†around by eliminating†positions to create new ones for†people with degrees.† As†aforementioned, most employees at the NC DOC do not have any degrees beyond high school and therefore will be disadvantaged and not qualified to apply for the newly created positions.††DOC employees are the lowest paid State Employees and the least appreciated ones and we have been overlooked by our†government and the General Assembly for years.† As comparison†take a look at the† Office Assistant†IV pay at†DOC†that never even reaches the median of the pay scale, even for employees that have worked for DOC for more than 20 years, whereas an Office Assistant IV at†the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety makes the†max salary to the last dollar of the maximum range available, even for new employees.†Where is the equity and fairness in that? †To work in a prison is dangerous and stressful and†employees have†to be aware of their surroundings at all times.† As said before, we feel singled out and we feel unappreciated and we feel as the sacrificial lamb,†not due to the budget shortfall but to shift†money around from the jobs we will loose to some other newly created positions for probation and so that other state employees in the educational fields can receive raises.† How can that possibly save any money?† How will State Government attract good employees in the future when the ones it has, and that are faithfully serving, are being tossed to the side when the going gets tough, and are ignored when the going is good?

††††††††We know that you have to make many difficult decisions but†we would like to know what will happen to us, the Department of Correction employees, that will be laid off when you will close McCain Correctional Hospital and all†the other employees of the smaller prisons that are on the Closure Proposal List?††We feel that the Reduction in Force letter that we will receive will be just a piece of paper that is of no value.††We are†wondering why†you are†creating all these new jobs that most people that will be laid off will not be able to obtain because they do not have the education to qualify for these positions?††Could we possibly be trained and be sent to college†by the state to be able to apply and to be able to feed our children and keep our homes or will we end up on the welfare†list and in homeless†shelters?† Most†DOC employees live from paycheck to paycheck and have no savings.† So please think of all the families and†especially†the children you will be affecting with your decisions.† My children would have to drop out of college if I loose my job and therefore all the things you are trying to do for†education will not be of any help to them and I am quite sure that the same would apply to many other children of DOC employees that you are planning to cut.† What is education made available going to do good when you†have no time to be able to get educated because you cannot afford it because†you have no time and have to work two jobs just to get by?† I, for my part, would love to go back to†college to†work toward my bachelors degree but I can not because I do not make enough money†to put my†two children and myself†through college at the same time.††You see, my children are all I have and they come first, for they and their future are my main priority, but when I loose my job I can not even take care of†their future†anymore.† Please think about how you will affect all these children by laying us off, since children and education seem to be your main priority†such should include the children of DOC employees and their future as well. ††

Cordially,

I request you support fair insurance rates throughout the state of North Carolina insted of focusing on the coastal counties to raise rates so the more populated areas can get reduced rates as they contain more votes.

I have lived at Kure Beach throught three hurricanes with no damage yet Raleigh, has experienced significant damage as well as Tarboro area.† During hurricane Hugo the coast had little or no damage and Charlotte had extensive damage.† Yet Raleigh and Charlotte will get lower rates paid for by the coastal area.† I have no problem with ocean front properties having to pay due to their location but not those blocks off the ocean front.†

This is a test of fairness versus political pay backs.† I hope you will stand up for fairness.

Subject: DOC and DOT Employees' Salaries.

Governor Perdue,

I have a question which needs addressing concerning Department of Corrections and the Department of Transportations pay increases. What are these two state agencies' always leave behind or are never given a sizable pay increase verses the NC Teachers. I come from a family of educators and I have seen first hand their increases. My mother retired in 2001 and 9 months later is became teaching again or what is called double-dipping and she makes the money. I have been a state employee for 11 years this april. First, as a housekeeper in the Housing Department at UNCP- Pembroke, I worked like a slave yet did not even make $19,000.00 annual. I tranfered to DOC in 2004 for more money and two years ago, some employees at UNCP recieved reasonable increases through a program called Career-banding and good for them.

†DOC and DOT employees are still wondering if their time will even come. Who will champion for those individuals who put their lives on the line day in and day out inside†prisons, while transporting inmates to appointments, on work details or road clean-up crews. Who keeps these undesireables/criminals where they have been placed away from society for†acts of wrong doing. Who†prevents the innocents from†being killed or assaulted ensuring a safe†environment inside the confinds of correctional facilities. We do, those who are called Correctional Officers. Some may not give it their†all daily†yet many others†try†to and succeed to do it the next day and day in and day out; keeping society and†even the Governor safe.†

This is not a difficult job to do but keep in mind it can be a deadly job. All who provide security or those who are part of the criminal Justice system have some or much more†degree of a dangerous job to do.

DOT has a dangerous type of job also. Not only are these men and women exposed to the elements; they also work with inmates of a†lesser classification (Minium custody level but still dangerous), in addition; they work in an unsafe environment (highways, roadsides, tunnels, bridges, and near waterways).

I understand that I must contact my legislature representatives of my district, the state†personnel office, and†my North Carolina congressman or congresswoman for an answer to this question.

The recession which the United States is currently experiencing is very bad and every state and federal agency is feeling the punch so I know DOC and DOT will feel the punch more now than ever before.†


Thank you for your time,

Dear Ms. Brewer,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding paying for college.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



Pursuing higher education in this tough economy is a challenge for many of us. Paying for school can be quite a financial commitment coupled with day-to-day, on-going financial obligations.  If you have not, I recommend you contact the North Carolina State Higher Education Assistance Authority (NCSHEAA) at P.O. Box 13663, RTP, NC  27709 or by phone at 919/549-8614 to speak directly with a loan representative.  The staff at NCSHEAA is equipped and knowledgeable of various financial assistance options in place to aid in paying for school.  They should be able to advise you based on the specific circumstances relating to your financial needs.  Additionally, you may wish to contact the College Foundation of North Carolina (CFNC).  They can be found on line at: www.cfnc.org <http://www.cfnc.org/> .  CFNC offers a variety of ways to pay for college, including needs based scholarships, grants and loans.




 I wish you the best as you continue your educational endeavors.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am a school nurse who is losing my job due to budget cuts to the school
systems next fall.  I have dedicated several years of my career in public
health and dedicated myself to school nursing by becoming a certified school
nurse.  In light of these budget cuts I have been forced to take a job in a
hospital setting having no relevance to school health or child health simply
because I could not find any other jobs related to my expertise.  I would
like to know what your stance is on school nurses and do you feel that in
the future more jobs will be created for our specialty.  As more and more
children with chronic health issues enter our public schools I feel our
roles are especially vital to both the students and staff, and I am hurt
deeply that our leaders feel that we are expendable and are forcing
non-licensed staff to perform medical procedures within our schools. Please
take in to consideration how important school nurses are and fight to get
more nurses into the schools.

Thanks for your support.

Rockingham Fire Chief Is Engaging in a Pattern of Abuse Against Union Fire Fighters, Says IAFF

Chief Threatens Violence Against Fire Fighters

WASHINGTON--(<http://www.businesswire.com>BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rockingham Fire Chief Charles Gardner has suspended two fire fighters and fired another since the Rockingham Fire Fighters Local 4702 filed a lawsuit against the city for unlawfully withholding overtime pay from the cityís first responders.

ìChief Gardnerís pattern of abusive behavior is in retaliation for the decision by Rockingham fire fighters to form a union. Forming a union is a legally protected right in our country. Abusive retaliation against workers for any reason is not legal,î said Larry Osborne, 12th District Vice President of the International Association of Fire Fighters.

Ten members of the Rockingham Fire Department formed Rockingham Fire Fighters IAFF Local 4702 on October 1, 2008. On March 13, 2009, the general counsel of the IAFF filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The suit seeks overtime compensation unlawfully withheld from the fire fighters. Withholding overtime pay violates the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).†All 10 members of Local 4702 are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

ìChief Gardner has little regard for the law or the civil rights of fire fighters in the union. Chief Gardnerís tyrannical behavior is un-American, and itís time to shed light on his illegal actions,î said David Anders, president of the Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics of North Carolina.

Since the lawsuit was filed and the chief learned of the existence of Local 4702 and the names of those in the union, every union officer and a majority of the union members have been unfairly singled out for retaliatory discipline.

* On March 24, the chief issued a written reprimand to Local 4702 member Mike Meginnis for allegedly being ìdisrespectfulî to Captain Vic McCaskill;
* On April 6, the chief suspended Local 4702 Vice President Mike Williams for a week (a total of three 24-hr shifts) for allegedly asking a non-union fire fighter to join the union while at a fire station;
* On April 21, Local 4702 members Troy Sorrell, Gus Bellamy and Chuck Bowden left separate family gatherings to report to the station following a turn-in alarm, which requires fire fighters to respond to the fire station or the scene of a fire, depending on the chiefís orders, if they are needed to assist in fire fighting. Even though the chief said over the radio after the initial turn-in alarm that additional personnel were not needed at the scene of the fire in question, he suspended each of these three fire fighters for one-day and refused to compensate them for responding to the station;
* Fire fighter Mike Meginnis was disciplined for failing to report to a turn-in alarm that occurred while he was being examined by a doctor. His pending suspension was dropped only after he submitted a note from a doctor;
* On April 24, Local 4702 President Robbie Barber was suspended for a week (three 24-hour shifts) and Treasurer Rodney Gandy was terminated, each for allegedly failing to respond to a turn-in alarm while off duty. Gandy was told by the chief that he was required to bring his radio into church with him. Gandy was also told that he could not take his wife to dinner anywhere more than 45 minutes from Rockingham because he needed to remain available to respond at any time for a turn-in alarm;
* On April 26, McKinnon was suspended for a week (three 24-hour shift days) for failing to respond to a turn-in alarm.
Since the lawsuit was filed, Chief Gardner has denied the use of earned vacation leave and canceled vacation leave that had already been approved and scheduled.†He has failed to pay fire fighters for responding to off-duty turn-in alarms, even though they are entitled to receive pay when they respond.

The departmentís two non-union fire fighters have not been disciplined since the lawsuit was filed and reportedly have been offered double compensation by the chief to cover the shifts of the Local 4702 fire fighters he has suspended.

Chief Gardner has a violent, well-documented past.

* On October 9, 1997, the Richmond County Daily Journal ran a story entitled ìCase Against City Inspector Dismissed.î The story detailed an assault charge brought by a contractor against Chief Gardner, who at the time was serving as a building inspector for the city.†According to the article, Gardner ìhit him in the face three times, broke his glasses, and caused his nose to bleed, requiring medical attention.î
* On January 21, 2009, fire fighters Robbie Barber, Richard OíNeil and Mike Williams heard Chief Gardner say ìif the city fires me, I will come back to the fire department, shoot everyone and then go to the city hall and pick them off one by one, like ducks.î
ìChief Gardner is a classic bully and incapable of serving in a management capacity. In light of his history and overt threats, it is incumbent on the city of Rockingham to step in and keep its fire fighters safe from the chief who was sworn to protect them. Chief Gardnerís disregard for the law and lack of common decency make it clear that he needs to be reined in before he breaks the law again or harms innocent people,î Anders said.

The International Association of Fire Fighters, headquartered in Washington, DC, is the leading advocate in North America for the safety and training of fire fighters and paramedics. The IAFF represents more than 295,000 full-time professional fire fighters and paramedics who protect communities in every state in the United States and every province in Canada.

	Again, I send yet another email and expect to get no response.† However futile this is I would like to firmly voice my opinion as an employee/teacher of one of the public school systems in North Carolina.† Spending/finances have been frozen: no more paper, no more ink, no more supplies!† 1/2% pay cut! and where exactly is the ten hours of flexible time off suppose to come from?† What if there are no inclement weather days to make up and if so, where is the money suppose to come from if a substitute has to be paid.† How much of a pay cut has the governor taking?† Is she paying for her own gas, clothing, office supplies, etc.?
This again affirms my decision, (after thirteen years of teaching) that the government and our state government does not truly want me or my coworkers to do the best for the children who will become our future.† I am and will continue to look for another career. I am ashamed to admit that I am and continue to be, at this time, an employee for the state of North Carolina.
If this kind of MIS administration continues, it will probably be the first and last of Governor Purdue's term in office.

> Six Economic Recovery Workshops Announced

Gov. Perdue†this week announced that the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold a series of workshops across the state to provide information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. The first workshop is scheduled for April 28 at 1:30 p.m. in Winston-Salem State University‚Äôs Dillard Auditorium.

> Workshop attendees will have an opportunity to hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds. These representatives will discuss the current status of funds in their agencies, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

> ‚ÄúNorth Carolina is set to receive more than $8 billion in federal recovery money, and I intend for our state to not only be prepared to use this money to put our people back to work but also to spend the money with the utmost accountability and transparency,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThese workshops will build the bridges between state, local and county governments ‚Äì and anyone else interested in utilizing recovery funds ‚Äì to ensure this money is used to benefit all of North Carolina and our people.‚Äù

> OERI Director Dempsey Benton will lead the workshops. ‚ÄúThe economic recovery funds are purpose-driven, rather than place-driven,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that attendees understand the funded programs so†they may actively participate. It‚Äôs also important for participants to understand the expectations for efficiency, transparency and accountability in the investment of funds.‚Äù

> Additional workshops will be held in Asheville, Charlotte, Greenville, Raleigh and Wilmington in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. For additional information visit <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov.†

> State Board of Education and DPI to Intervene in Halifax County Schools

Gov. Bev Perdue†announced†this week that the State Board of Education Chair and CEO Bill Harrison, State Superintendent June Atkinson, the board and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction will begin an unprecedented intervention in Halifax County Schools, one of the low-performing school districts in the state.†

> "My goal is to improve public schools and student performance," said Gov. Perdue.† "Dr. Harrison, Superintendent Atkinson and I will act aggressively in Halifax County and all of North Carolina to make sure our schools have the support, direction and accountability that give our kids a chance to succeed."

> Under the intervention plan, NCDPI staff will provide intensive support and oversight to coach principals in effective instructional and school leadership, to provide tools to help central office personnel better guide the school district, and ensure that teachers get the necessary support and resources needed to improve student learning.

> ‚ÄúHalifax Superintendent Geraldine Middleton has been receptive to us and we look forward to helping her and her team move forward,‚Äù said Harrison. ‚ÄúThis intervention is a partnership with Halifax County Schools, and one in which the state board and education department will guide professional development and create a supportive framework with one goal:† improved student learning and achievement.‚Äù

> Activities already have begun in Halifax but will intensify this summer and in the 2009-10 school year.† Clear expectations and direction will be provided to local leadership, principals and teachers. Three weeks of professional development will be provided to all Halifax principals and central office personnel, and two weeks of professional development will be provided to teachers in the Halifax schools over the summer. This activity will kick off the 2009-10 school year and provide clear expectations and direction for educators in the district and schools.

>> UPDATE - Friday, April 24:†

>> Governor Bev Perdue today cleared her calendar to make an unannounced visit to Dawson Elementary and Southeast Halifax High schools in Halifax County.† She met with the principals, teachers and students, and observed a classroom of her choosing at each school.

>> ‚ÄúIt was important to me to get a first-hand look at the schools in Halifax County,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThe state will work with local education leaders to maximize efforts to improve student achievement.† Strong leaders, strong teachers and strong community support can make the difference. ‚Äù

Subject: question about flexible time off

I have read the letter from Bev Perdue about the pay cuts.  As I many are
upset at this cut because with having both my husband and myself as state
employees this is a double hit for us.  All the places that are reporting
the information seems to be confusing.

This quote In return, each
employee will receive 10 hours of flexible time off."

What does that mean. At first I thought it meant that since we had to give
up 1/2 % of our salary it meant that we would get 10 hours of a bonus time
if you will put it that way  as compensation for having to give up part of
our salaries. Then other places make it seem like a double hit.  In
addition to giving up 1/2% of salary we also have to take off 10 unpaid
hours.  Can someone please clarify this.

Subject: Attn Scheduling Office :: Re State Education Budget

Governor Perdue,

I had the opportunity to attend your CFCC townhall meeting last month where you addressed the current budget crisis and the funding cuts that were effecting school programs.

I'm a†partner in a technology company in Wilmington NC that has developed a platform that generates revenue for schools.† We've just had our program adopted in Pender County where our very first user,†Principal, Marcus†Skipper,†has called our program 'revolutionary'.† They are extremely excited about it, especially given the current budget situation.

The†program costs the schools and the parents NOTHING, and†pays the schools for purchases that they are already making using nationwide vendors.† Our initial assessment is that this program can make a school with 500 students an additional $1,000 a month.† With over 2,000 schools in North Carolina, that's an additional $20+ Million dollars that can be given DIRECTLY back to the schools.
Our program is being adopted in schools in Texas, Oregon, Florida, as well as North Carolina.

We want to speed up the introduction of the program to North Carolina schools and quicken the pace by which they can benefit financially from the results. Clearly the budget shortfalls that North Carolina is facing†have created an urgent need for innovation and collaboration that is unprecedented. We have a platform†that can directly address†budgetary needs†through innovation and use the same innovation to foster collaboration between public and private organizations and the community as a whole. All to the financial benefit of our schools.† We HAVE been traveling from school to school in our region to introduce the program, it takes only about 15 minutes to engage the faculty and staff, it IS that simple.

There are many more benefits to the program. New tech jobs for North Carolina, new training opportunities for our students and new business opportunities are just a few. These can all be realized much faster if the program†is adopted on a statewide level. Can you meet with us within the next week so that we can explain the full details of the program?

I know a request for your time in such a tight window is difficult, but we need to get schools BEFORE they break for summer session to adopt this program.† Summer reading lists, athletic equipment, elective equipment, uniforms, and back to school apparel and equipment can VERY literally mean thousands of dollars for each school a month; if there's been a more urgent need for school funding, I haven't seen it and we can deliver it.† Carolina innovation at its finest.

I look forward to your reply and I hope to speak with you soon.
Respectfully,

Brad Hinely

Subject: veterans denied justice from Gov'ment ---- courtroom file up, with false papers!!

Another false Move ----No Justice ---- they did the same thing over and over,  send my paper to the NCDMV again, When this is wrong doings by courts Here. If I don't get any help I going to ask the Veterans of America to see to this Unjustice by some crooky people in the government who are  messing up our great country as domestic enemies to the American People who are blessed by God, who are disrepecting veterans and falsefying papers against Vets, who(the Vet's) are the heart of this great country. Crooks who are reallly devils selling out our country. Devils, who use Drugs and Alcohol against veterans who get this problem from wars, who become depended on this gabbage(Drugs and Alcohol)  from every war we've been in"" But thank God he has Healed me  completely from Drugs and Alcohol. But still I can't get any release or help,(they will not let her(Governor Perdue)see my papers) from a racist state like NC., they rather bring the foreigners in to
 help them then vet's who fought for this country freedom.


Dear Governor B. Perdue (or Governor Office):

I recieved a letter from The North carolina dept. of transportation saying they had been asked to look into my case about my driver license, from the Governor Office. This was not the Problem as stated in my Paper work the Problem: The Problem Was false information that indicted me and false information introducted in court Jan.15, 1998 .   At Least Read My Papers. and send them to the Governor to be taken care of by the Justice dept of Goverment or do we have One.
       When the fact is I never ask them  to looking into my matter, because over the past 11yrs. I was already aware of the North carolina laws about driver licenses have recieved a great number of letters from them. telling me that they can't help me. I can understand that they can't help me, I am a veteran with an Honorable discharged who recieved incorrect justice from the craven county courts, wrong doings in my case that has cripple my abilities to even work or live in a decent home, or to serve God. after serve his country well in the U.S Army, having to come home a still fight to live behind racism, which keeps me from affording an Attorney. If I wasn't stripped of my license and my College education I could afford One.
 I don't want you to change the Laws of NC,  I want the Laws to up hold and correct wrong doings by(Law) the courts. to  looked into this case. So that I can have the freedom to live decently in a country I fought for and I am not asking for handouts of 35 billion dollars, and then go  claim bankrupted or apart of the 8 billion NC recieved and probably will get stolen by some North carolina corrupted  officials, just like I was  underminded by some of the craven county Court people. I just want tobe able to get to work, after my few mistakes which I never killed any body or came close to killing body. This matter unjustice belongs to the Governor or her office, please send it back to the Governor Office and stop side tracking this American Veterans just to get rid of me , we fought the wars not we got to fight the Politicians.

I Just want Justice from wrong Doings to me -- I served my time in the Army and in Prison(which  I Wrongly  done)
