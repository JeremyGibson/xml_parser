Governor Perdue,



Please read the attached document from the Florida Governor’s office. I would love to see similar legislation in NC. I hope you would consider this important issue and not be swayed by the power and influence from NCs 500 lb BCBS gorilla’s aversion to delay, deny “in network” status to qualified physicians and deny treatment coverage.



I am happy to discuss this issue and would love to have a meeting with you.

I would also invite Robert Zaytoun to the meeting, as his knowledge base on this subject is exceptional. I am happy to cover his attending service fees.



I look forward to hearing from you, look forward to meeting with you, look forward to discussing this issue and look forward to NC following FL’s courage and correctness.



Regards,





Lindy McHutchison. MD

<http://emilyslist.org/r/79206/363114/0><http://www.emilyslist.org/images/email/email-header-emily-sm.gif>



Dear Beverly, <http://emilyslist.org/r/79207/363114/0><http://emilyslist.org/r/79207/363114/0><http://emilyslist.org/images/email/20090728-WJC_email11_lap.gif><http://emilyslist.org/r/79207/363114/0>

These tough times are touching all of our lives, quite personally. And these challenges cannot be addressed without real changes.

We can't afford to lose our Democratic majority in 2010, and women -- our nation's most progressive force -- will be crucial to protecting and building upon our strength.

That is where EMILY's List stands out.

I know EMILY's List well. It was started by my good friend Ellen Malcolm back in 1985. At that time, no Democratic woman had been elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right or elected governor of a large state. I've watched EMILY's List grow and help elect record numbers of pro-choice Democratic women -- including Barbara Boxer, Jennifer Granholm, Gwen Moore, and of course, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In 2010, EMILY's List will be critical to electing more progressive women to help President Obama make change happen. But they must meet each and every one of their early goals. If they don't, their proven strategy is put at risk. Join me in helping EMILY's List reach their critical July goal, and if you make a contribution by July 31 a group of dedicated EMILY's List members will match your donation dollar for dollar, tripling your impact. Even a gift of just $10 will have a significant impact.

<http://emilyslist.org/r/79208/363114/0>Click here to contribute as little as $10 to EMILY's List by July 31 and have triple the impact.

Most of us are still feeling really good about last November's elections -- and we should.

But we can't rest on our laurels. History shows us that in 15 out of the last 17 midterm elections the party in the White House has lost seats in Congress. In 2010, if Congress switches hands, Republicans will regain power and President Obama's progress will grind to a halt.

There are 49 districts that Democrats hold in the House right now that voted for McCain in 2008. These Democrats are in "red" territory and the GOP is already gunning to take back what they see as "theirs."

And then we have the Senate. The GOP only needs to win over one Senate seat to ensure Democrats do not reach a filibuster-proof majority. So 2010 means not only holding on to the Senate seats we have, but also adding more progressive senators to that chamber.

Many of these new leaders can and should be women.

We need more women in Congress to fight for all of the issues that matter to you, from health care and reproductive freedom, the economy and education, to the environment and energy independence.

That’s why it’s so important that we help EMILY's List prepare for the tough road ahead and help them meet their critical July goal by July 31. There are just 3 days left to help them. I hope I can count on you.

<http://emilyslist.org/r/79209/363114/0>Click here to contribute to EMILY's List today.

We must not yield power to the Republicans in 2010 -- and supporting EMILY's List will help ensure we don't. Thank you for all you’re doing to put our country back on track.

Sincerely,

<http://emilyslist.org/images/email/wjc_signature.gif>

PRESS RELEASE

Senate Republican Leader

Senator Phil Berger

26th Senatorial District

Phone Number: (919) 733-5708                     North Carolina Senate

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                           July 28, 2009



Berger to Democrats: Release Spending Plan



Raleigh, N.C. – As Democrats continue closed-door negotiations concerning the state budget, they have yet to release a spending plan.  Democrats have only acknowledged that they plan to spend $20.3 billion in the state budget including 

federal stimulus money.  They also plan to raise close to $1 billion in new taxes if not more.



Senate Republican Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) made the following statement:



“Before Democrats place the burden of $1 billion or more in new taxes on the backs of North Carolina families and small businesses, they should release their spending plan.  



"Taxpayers ought to know how their money will be spent before they are asked to foot the bill for new state spending.  

If Democrats are confident that no waste will be found in their spending plan, then they should be anxious to make 

their plan public.”

Governor Perdue,   

I have recently learned that Superior Court Judge Leon Stanback is scheduled to retire September 1st, 2009.  Therefore, I am writing you in support of Judge Elaine Bushfan as the next Superior Court Judge for Durham County.   

Judge Bushfan was born and raised in Durham and has tirelessly worked to address and improve the quality of life in this community.  Since taking District Court office in 1995, she has been a tireless advocate of juveniles and the juvenile justice system as a whole.  Judge Bushfan recognized early on that the key to solving, or at least better managing, the growing criminal justice system rested with the youth of the community.  Judge Bushfan has publicly stated and worked towards creating programs designed to prevent youth from entering the judicial system.  Towards that end, Judge Bushfan worked with various Durham County officials and established the very first Juvenile Task Force in Durham County.  While this specific program has changed throughout the years the concept has remained, as has Judge Bushfan's steadfast involvement.  She also found her own "positive diversion program", known as the Restoration Institute for Leaders.  This program focuses on an array of judiciary, social, and vocational services as well as incentives for at-risk juveniles.  Thanks to Judge Bushfan's vision and efforts, countless juveniles from the Durham community have managed to escape "low academics, truancy, disruptive behaviors, and gang involvement." 

Judge Bushfan is perhaps one of the strongest advocates the citizens of Durham have in our continuing fight against crime.  Being a native Durhamite, Judge Bushfan knows this community and it's problems from a first-hand perspective.  A simple review of her service thus far clearly indicates that she also knows the needs and solutions to those problems as well.    

I would like to again respectfully request that you appoint Judge Elaine Bushfan as the next Superior Court Judge of Durham County. 

Sincerely Yours,  

Mindy Solie

Governor Perdue,



Please read the attached document from the Florida Governor’s office. I would love to see similar legislation in NC. I hope you would consider this important issue and not be swayed by the power and influence from NCs 500 lb BCBS gorilla’s aversion to delay, deny “in network” status to qualified physicians and deny treatment coverage.



I am happy to discuss this issue and would love to have a meeting with you.

I would also invite Robert Zaytoun to the meeting, as his knowledge base on this subject is exceptional. I am happy to cover his attending service fees.



I look forward to hearing from you, look forward to meeting with you, look forward to discussing this issue and look forward to NC following FL’s courage and correctness.



Regards,





Lindy McHutchison. MD

THE CLIMATE POST
"Thursdays at Three"
July 30, 2009

<http://www.ClimatePost.net>http://www.ClimatePost.net

BIG HOPES FOR "AL G."

First Things First: The trouble with electricity is that you can’t seal the unused portion when you’re done using it and put it on a shelf. The New York Times explores one potential industry in the “green jobs” archipelago trying to change that, filing <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/science/28batt.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&hp>a piece from industrial-belt poster-city Allentown, Penn.  International Battery is developing a cereal-box-size battery that could help remake the energy economy–and begin to dent America’s addiction to oil. The company and more than 120 others are vying for <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072403163.html?referrer=delicious>$2 billion in grants the Department of Energy will dole out to seed a U.S. industry for electric-car batteries.



Another strategy that saves electricity for later, beyond batteries, is to use less now. The U.S. might reduce its 2020 energy use by 23 percent with a comprehensive–and well-executed–program to burn less and harness more from what we do burn. That’s the conclusion of a major <http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/electricpowernaturalgas/US_energy_efficiency/>McKinsey report that analyzes and models integrated energy efficiency planning among local, state, and federal governments, and public and private entities. Forty percent of the <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/business/energy-environment/30energy.html?_r=1>savings would fall in the industrial sector, with 35 percent in homes, and the balance in the commercial sector. The net savings from identified actions comes to $600 million in the next decade in the McKinsey scenarios.

Energy efficiency is frequently referred to as “low-hanging fruit,” or the “fifth fuel” for electricity, after coal, natural gas, nuclear, and the various renewables. Amory Lovins, the energy strategist and co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, is no stranger to energy efficiency. His 1976 Foreign Affairs essay, “Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken” [<http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/Energy/E77-01_TheRoadNotTaken.pdf>pdf] called for “a prompt and serious commitment to efficient use of energy.” The essay was immediately recognized as a maddening disruption (some people liked it and some hated it). This week Lovins and two co-writers call for a new manufacturing <http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0728/p09s01-coop.html>paradigm, akin to the shift during World War II, in which Detroit dropped car-making and went into the tank business. They write in their recently acquired roles as co-owners of <http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-07-28-fuel-cell-general-motors_N.htm>General Motors.

Here’s an idea that is certain not to be the next step in <http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Presence-of-Mind-Blue-Sky-Thinking.html>the history of “cap-and-trade.” To reduce greenhouse gases from transportation, the federal government sets a maximum number of miles Americans can drive every year, a cap that declines over time. Drivers who exceed their cap any year must buy mile credits from less traveled compatriots. Okay, it’s a bad idea, and one unconsidered by federal agencies, NGOs, and industry groups who built scenarios for <http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/28/28greenwire-us-can-cut-half-its-carbon-emissions-from-tran-16812.html>halving U.S. transportation emissions by 2050. Reduced speed limits, land-use change, and tweaking travel behavior might bring a 24 percent drop. The changes that would bring those reductions toward 50 percent include “pay-as-you-go” auto insurance and per-mile driving fees.

The Feel Good Hit of the Summer: The U.S. and China held an <http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE56R4WN20090728?rpc=28&pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0>upbeat summit in Washington, which resulted in a signed memorandum that lays out how the world’s two largest carbon dioxide emitters can work together more closely on climate change and clean energy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the talks reinforced the centrality of climate change to the two nations’ relationship. President Barack Obama <http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/07/27/obamas-remarks-on-the-us-china-relationship/>opened the two-day event, noting that “neither of us profits from a growing dependence on foreign oil, nor can we spare our people from the ravages of climate change unless we cooperate.” This builds on previous memoranda of understanding, including the recent agreement to invest together in research into carbon capture and storage (CCS), or trapping CO2 from a coal-plant chimney and pumping it underground for the eons.


The House climate bill would <http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/24/24greenwire-house-climate-bill-dangles-cash-to-lure-ccs-fi-39268.html>dangle billions of dollars in incentives before coal-burning power plant operators, encouraging them to seek and deploy CCS technology. The government would reward carbon pioneers by making the first 6 gigawatts of stored emissions eligible for allowances worth up to $90 a ton, more than three times the price tag the EPA has projected for a high-end carbon price.

The Guardian relishes the conflict in <http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/29/germany-carbon-capture>this tale from Spremberg, Germany, where Swedish energy giant Vattenfall has built a $100 carbon capture and storage facility. Residents nearby the Schwarze Pumpe project are skeptical, apparently, of living atop a reservoir of carbon dioxide. “It was supposed to begin injecting by March or April of this year but we don’t have a permit. This is a result of the local public having questions about the safety of the project,” a Vattenfall official said. The European Union would like to build as many as a dozen such plants by 2015.

A Meaty Issue: climate change cuts close to something very close to the American heart: the American stomach. The Washington Post’s “Food and Dining” section riles carnivores in <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/28/AR2009072800390.html>this piece that recites the litany of obvious reasons why mass consumption of red meat fuels climate change. Ezra Klein cites a 3.5-year-old University of Chicago study that estimates a vegan diet prevents more emissions than trading in an inefficient car for a Toyota Prius [<http://geosci.uchicago.edu/%7Egidon/papers/nutri/nutriEI.pdf>pdf].  The problem: “Telling people to give up burgers doesn’t poll well.”

Why We Have Satellite Monitoring: Canadian astronaut Bob Thirsk is two months into a six-month stint on the International Space Station. On Sunday, he reported a personal observation that glaciers are melting. “Most of the time when I look out the window I’m in awe. But there are some effects of the human destruction of the Earth as well. “This is probably just a perception, but I just have the feeling that the glaciers are melting, the snow capping the mountains is less than it was 12 years ago when I saw it last time,” Thrisk said. “That saddens me a little bit.”

Many eyes in the climate sciences now turn north this time every year, to watch the Earth’s Arctic ice cap dissolve into the sea. The National Snow and Ice Data Center writes <http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/>updates on Arctic sea ice extent, usually the first week of the month. They’ve interrupted regular programming to note that this year sea ice is shrinking faster than in 2008, the second deepest melt, but still slower than in 2007, when the ice cap reached its lowest documented extent.


Congressional action on climate change has increased public attention to all aspects of debate, even in matters where most key scientists have high confidence in observations, such as whether climate change is happening, given temperature records of the past decade. This week came news that the global seas have set a <http://www.smh.com.au/environment/global-warming/warmest-seas-on-record-20090724-dw6c.html>heat record, warming to 0.59 degrees C above the 20th century average of 16.4 degrees C (about 62 degrees F). But it’s the air temperature that has received much (or, depending on your perspective, too little) scrutiny in the press and blogs. For further clarification, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration included a sidebar clarifying the matter, “Do global temperature trends over the last decade falsify climate predictions?” The passage can be found on pages 23-24 of this report <http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2008/ann/bams/full-report.pdf>pdf.


The Second “Al G.”: How’s this for a headline, from <http://www.technologyreview.com/business/23073/>Technology Review: “A Biofuel Process to Replace All Fossil Fuels.” This week Joule Biotechnologies, a start-up in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled its process for harvesting 20,000 gallons of biofuel per acre of souped-up algae. The lede reveals, “If this yield proves realistic, it could make it practical to replace all fossil fuels used for transportation with biofuels.” That’s a big if. The company has raised “substantially less than $50 million,” some of it from employees. The challenges are formidable. Algae populations can grow too fast and expire before their work is done. And the bioreactors themselves can be too expensive for their fuels to pay off (Unless <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/28/AR2009072802671.html?nav=rss_business>gas prices spike and don’t fall again). The company hopes to start building a <http://www.eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2009/07/27/5>commercial scale plant in 2011. This technology is most interesting and most welcome, but be cautious about messianic stories about start-ups looking for VC funding.

with my wife, Terry and 4 children, we reside at 1377 Old Dry Creek  
Road, Morganton, NC 28655.

Terry and I met with you briefly yesterday afternoon while we were  
walking through the Capitol, absorbing North Carolina History,  
admiring the documents written by John Adams.

We knew you were busy when you asked us if we resided in the state, so  
I kept my response short and indicated we were from Western North  
Carolina. Please excuse my ignorance, I had no intention of being  
hasteful. We actually had a lot on our minds that we wanted to convey  
to you about our experience over the past year.

It was just over a year ago that Terry and I made one of the most  
controversial decisions in our lives and that was to pick up our  
family of six from the state of New Jersey, where we both lived for  
the past forty years. I know that you must be thinking...moving out of  
NJ could not be so difficult. We left behind, family and friends to  
chart a new course in life not only for us, but more importantly for  
our four young children.

We not only discovered North Carolina, but we discovered the people  
and geographic beauty of the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains at  
Lake James in Western North Carolina.

We simply wanted to convey to you Governor Perdue, that we are pleased  
to be permanent residents of the state of North Carolina. While it was  
a very difficult to head into uncharted territory, personally,  
professionally and geographically, not realizing the economic storm  
that was in front of us nine months ago, we believe it was a  
monumental decision of a lifetime, perhaps precisely because of the  
struggle to make the right decision.

Our trip to Raleigh was by no means random. It was our second trip to  
the capital in as many months. We were there yesterday a bit early,  
anticipating traffic problems due to the visit of President Obama on  
our way to a meeting at 6pm for the final disposition by the Joint  
Commission for Municipal Incorporation, regarding the Village of Lake  
James.

We had some time on our hands and we thought we might stop by the  
museums to learn a little more about the state. The capitol caught our  
eye and we proceeded to go on the self guided tour.

Unfortunately, the Commission did not give a favorable review of the  
application sponsored by Senator Jim Jacumin, when in fact all of the  
legal criteria was met for each and every phase. Various members of  
the commission questioned the issue of contiguity, when in fact the  
Commission asked and was advised by David M. Lawrence, the leading  
authority in NC on this and many other issues involving municipal  
incorporations, that in fact the area meets the requirements of  
contiguity.

Certainly, the entire issue is charged with great emotion and I fully  
understand that there is indeed a political process that must occur.  
While I am not currently directly involved with the task force for the  
formation of the Village of Lake James, I can tell you without bias,  
meeting multiple times with the proponents of the Village that these  
individuals not only care deeply for the entire diverse community, but  
also have the foresight to understand that the only constant is change  
itself.

You made a very strong impression on both of us when you spoke at the  
grand opening ceremony of the North Carolina Research Campus in  
Kannapolis last October on how government, industry and private  
individuals can come together to achieve great accomplishments. We  
were amazed, astonished and inspired at what was accomplished in such  
a short period of time. The vision of David Murdock was brought to  
fruition, not because it was easy, but because of the realization that  
it was the right thing to do for the long term in spite of the  
daunting and seemingly insurmountable task of getting the project off  
the ground.

This is a small local issue compared to the NCRC. However, Terry and  
I  sincerely believe that there are many great minds in the group of  
proponents for the formation of the Village of Lake James that will  
act in a similar fashion as Mr. Murdock to secure the future of this  
region for the next one hundred years through education, technology  
and retirement  while preserving the natural beauty of this  
magnificent landscape.

I understand that there is a fair amount of resistance to passing this  
bill through the current session and that the chances are very slim  
that it would even make it out of the Senate as I write this.

Before yesterday afternoon we had no intention of petitioning anyone  
for help, much less the Governor of the state of North Carolina but I  
developed a compelling need to contact you after our brief hello and  
making the connection to the NCRC.

Lake James is our final destination. It is home to our family. I  
believe the NCRC will be home to a part of our business someday soon  
as well. The region is full of unlimited potential for the  
technological future only if we plan with unrelenting fervor not  
tomorrow, but today.

Please feel to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns at  
any time by phone or email. Home Tel: 828.584.6092, Mobile: 828.448.1494


Yours, Sincerely,


Greg & Terry Norell

Summary for NC Dept of Commerce and Governor's office.


We are in final negotiations for a contract to assemble a Swiss solar product to be installed in the US.  In addition we are negotiating to assemble solar modules in the US for an Indian/Canadian company.

For the last two years we have been developing a range of building integrated products including low cost solar roofing products, named AllRoof(R), buiding facades, integrated solar thermal and electric roofs, and other products.

We have the opportunity to begin production in August of the contract manufacture and utilize that as a base to introduce our proprietary products.  We have in place a $1 million order for solar tiles.

We will be buying laminators and testers in the next few weeks. 

We still have not committed on a place to build.

We favor NC but we are being offered a combination of the following from VA, DC, PA, and MD.

1.Rent free facility for 1-2 years
2. Assistance in hiring and training personnel  (10 immediately, 100 expected by the end of one year)
3. Soft loans or grants or a combination of the two of $1,000,000 or more to cover certification and testing, related startup costs, and expansion.
4. Short term tax waivers - property, personal property, business tax
5. Assistance to jump start product introduction on state jobs or by grants to third parties

We will be bringing $250,000 to $500,000 up front right now.    We need to decide where to go within about 2 weeks.

Protecting Public Education

All of us in North Carolina face significant challenges from the national economic crisis - and our state's budget is not immune from these effects.  In fact, our state faces its largest shortfall on record - $4.7 billion.  As legislators attempt to close this enormous gap, we have seen brutal cuts proposed to our children's public edcation.  But in North Carolina we must act boldly to protect the classroom.

We cannot and must not cripple education.  Cutting the classroom means cutting short our economic future.  That's why Governor Perdue is calling on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  We hope you will join her in the fight to protect public education in North Carolina.

Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate. 

"I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools," said Gov. Perdue.

The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.  Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families.

Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536>Executive Order 20, restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year.

“Until a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year,” Gov. Perdue said.

The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

To protect the state’s core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

The order rescinds the governor’s previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.  The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years.

“North Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state,” Gov. Perdue said. “Established companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.”

Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252.

North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit <http://www.conti-online.com>www.conti-online.com.  For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission at (828) 693-1703.

Gov. Perdue Announces Second Round of Drinking Water and Wastewater Recovery Projects

Gov.

Gov. Perdue Blocks Proposal to Hike Income Tax on Working Families

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue announced her opposition to a proposed budget deal between the House and Senate. 

"I will not support a budget that is balanced on the backs of working families and that does not protect our public schools," said Gov. Perdue.

The legislative budget proposal included an income tax surcharge on all taxpayers and did not do what is necessary to protect public education.  Gov. Perdue called on the House and Senate to work together quickly to pass a budget that protects public education and core services without being balanced on the backs of working families.

Governor Signs Executive Order to Restrict Spending, Ensure Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue today signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=536>Executive Order 20, restricting state spending to ensure a balanced budget while legislators work to finalize a budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year.

“Until a budget is signed, this order will ensure that North Carolina maintains a balanced budget and that state agencies continue to follow the strict spending guidelines in place during the previous fiscal year,” Gov. Perdue said.

The executive order directs the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) to prioritize spending on mandatory obligations and to restrict state agency spending on travel and purchase orders for goods and services. It also restricts agency spending to fill vacant positions.

To protect the state’s core responsibilities in education and public safety, the order allows OSBM to make exceptions for direct expenses for classroom instruction and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety.

The order rescinds the governor’s previous executive order to restrict spending for the 2008-09 fiscal year.

Continental Teves to Add 338 Jobs in Fletcher

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced brake systems and components manufacturer Continental Teves will expand its operations in Henderson County.  The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of global automotive supplier Continental, plans to invest $30.1 million and create 338 jobs in Fletcher during the next five years.

“North Carolina ranks 10th nationally in automotive-related jobs thanks to the commitment of such international leaders as Continental and its subsidiary in our state,” Gov. Perdue said. “Established companies continue to grow here because they know the value of our top business climate and skilled workforce.”

Continental has its North American headquarters in Michigan and operates two facilities in North Carolina. The Fletcher manufacturing plant currently employs 288 workers, while a plant in Morganton has 367 employees. The overall average wage for the 338 new jobs in Fletcher is expected to be $36,179, not counting benefits, which is higher than the Henderson County average of $31,252.

North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information about Continental Teves or Continental, visit <http://www.conti-online.com/>www.conti-online.com.  For information about employment opportunities at the Fletcher manufacturing plant, call the Henderson County office of the N.C. Employment Security Commission at (828) 693-1703.

Dear Constituent:



Thank you for your recent email sharing your thoughts about Senate Bill 20, Voter-Owned Election for Treasurer.  The Governor appreciates hearing from you on this important issue. 



On July 7, 2009, Senate Bill 20 was withdrawn from the Senate calendar and re-referred back to committee for further study.  The Governor will continue to follow this legislation as it proceeds through the Senate.  To follow Senate Bill 20, go to <http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=sb+20>http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=sb+20   or contact your local North Carolina Senator.  For information on who represents you in the North Carolina General Assembly, please call 919/733-4111 or go to <http://www.ncleg.net/GIS/RandR07/Home.html>http://www.ncleg.net/GIS/RandR07/Home.html
