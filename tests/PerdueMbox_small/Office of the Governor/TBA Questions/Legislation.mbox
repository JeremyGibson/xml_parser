Dear Governor:



Bev, I'm writing to ask if you would support a bill for a specialty license plate for the NC Mountains-to-Sea Trail (a linear state park).  Because the trail goes from one side of the state to the other I thought you would be interested in helping the trail in this way.



The Mountains-to-Sea Trail runs 1000 miles across North Carolina from Great Smoky Mountain National Park to Jockeys Ridge State Park on the Outer Banks. The trail is now an official part of the state park system, and local governments and federal agencies are also stepping up their efforts to build the trail.



 About 500 miles of trail are already constructed, and we're starting to make real progress in acquiring new corridor for the trail thanks to funds the NC Legislature appropriated last year for Land for Tomorrow.



Our goal for the MST specialty license plate is to raise funds and awareness of the trail.



In the House, the primary bill sponsors are Susan Fisher, James Langdon, Alice Underhill, and Laura Wiley.  In the Senate, the primary sponsor is Joe Sam Queen.  The bill has already been sent to bill drafting.



If you are interested, I will let the primary sponsors know of your interest and help them let you know when they are ready to file the bill.



Please let me know if you'd like more information about the trail.  Kate Dixon, our Executive Director, and I would be happy to help you learn more about it.  Another great source of information is our website: <http://www.ncmst.org/>www.ncmst.org.



Thanks for your  support.

Subject: forced annexation

Comment: Last July, you said that you would consider giving landowners power to vote down involuntary annexations, but would wait for recommendations for a special state commission. The commission has voted to recommend a moratorium on forced annexations and a referendum for people under threat of such. Some majority leaders have already said that they will not allow either of these to come to the floor for a vote. And you know what happened last year with HB2367! So, are you going to help us, the people? Many of us voted for you partly because you did comment positively on a vote for the second-class disenfranchised people now being forcibly annexed! Best wishes and stay in charge! We need you, not the behind closed doors leadership we've had for many years. Marie Howell

Dear Governor Purdue and Members of North Carolina State Government,

Please support H27.  The definition of euthanasia is mercy killing. But there is nothing merciful about death in a gas chamber, by heartstick, or by gunshot, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.  Animals have no voice, no choice.  Shelter animals have suffered enough by virtue of their abandonment and often, their abuse and neglect.  Let us at least allow their deaths to be merciful. 

Thank you.

Subject: Please support the HR 1105, Fy09 Omnibus Appropriations bill

Comment: Your immediate action is needed once again to secure funding for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) reduction efforts. The US Senate is expected to vote on HR 1105, the FY09 Omnibus Appropriations bill within the next week. This bill includes funding for the current fiscal year for those government agencies for which funding was not finalized last year. The bill, which has already been approved by the House of Representatives, includes $22 million in additional funding for initiatives to accelerate implementation of the HHS Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections, $10.1 million to support CDC's National Healthcare Safety network (NHSN), and $2.5 million to ensure adherence to infection control measures and to respond to outbreaks of disease caused in part by re-use of syringes in outpatient settings. The inclusion of funding for HAI reduction initiatives, first in the stimulus package and now in the Omnibus Appropriations bill, is a testament to our efforts to prevent this serious health problem.

Content-Type: text/plain
X-Folder: Legislation

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am the founder of Durham Together for Resilient Youth, a Drug Free Community Coalition. Our mission is to prevent substance abuse among youth and overtime adults by addressing environmental risk factors and promoting protective factors. We are concerned about the Beer Tax and believe it should be increased. I have copied this letter to Mr. Michaux and Mr. McKissick. Thank you for your attention:



Living in extraordinary times, economic turmoil is impacting every segment of life.



Facing record budget shortfalls, Senator Marc Basnight proposes a tax increase on alcohol and tobacco products.  The N.C. Institute of Medicine, likewise, recommends an increase in the alcohol tax. While the tax on wine and distilled spirits has increased, the tax on beer, representing 90% of alcohol sales, remains unchanged after 40 years.



Whether a non drinker or responsible drinker, we are paying a heavy financial price for alcohol misuse.  It?s estimated that societal costs associated with alcohol abuse cost $900 per capita for every man, woman and child in the U.S.



Our state collects $212 million annually in tax revenues from the sale of alcohol products. It costs our State billions to deal with the problems associated with their misuse.



Underage drinking alone costs North Carolina an estimated $1.2 billion annually in medical and other costs.  The N.C. Institute of Medicine found in 2004 that alcohol and drug abuse (though mostly alcohol) cost our economy $12.4 billion.



Alcohol, an addictive drug, is the third leading cause of death in the U.S.  With the National Institutes of Health now finding that 53% of the nation?s alcoholics are young adults, age 26 or less, with most drinking as teens, the costs associated with alcohol abuse will only continue to rise at our expense.



Extraordinary times require extraordinary action ? 40 years later, it?s time to raise the tax on beer.  Let the alcohol industry sacrifice along with the rest us.



Sincerely,

Wanda Boone, CEO Durham Together for Resilient Youth

Dear, Ma'am

 My name is Mike G. I live in Vass,NC. I want to express my feelings regarding Bill S318. I ride a scooter and I feel that that S318 is unfair to all scooter riders. As Rep Goodwin stated "they broke the law, so why should we have to suffer". The only people suffering is the scooter riders. We're out there in the cold, and in the rain with no protection, but our clothing. Scooter riding is not fun at all. There have been plenty of times where I've been run off the road, had trash thrown on me, been flipped off, not to mention all of the debris (stones, sand, etc) that gets blown all over me. Scooter riders are forever stereotyped as alcoholics, and that is not the case for all. My situation stems from an accident 19 years ago in New Jersey. I was assessed a $3,000.00 surcharge that I never knew was put in place. When I moved to NC, I went to change my address and that's when I was told that NJ had a hold on my license. After contacting NJ, they told me since it's been 19 years the interest and penalties have added to the new amount of $7,550.93. I'm married with 4 boys, there is no way I can afford to pay that off and continue to pay my current bills and mortgage. I use that scooter as means of transportation to and from work only. If bill S318 does get passed, I will no longer have a way to and from work. There is no affordable public transportation, a cab company will charge $25.00 each way. I work 12 days on and 2 days off. That amounts to $600.00 every 2 weeks, I can not afford that. I as well as many others would lose their jobs, which in return would create an even larger drain on the economy. Unemployment would then be our "only" means of income. If there is anything you can do to help all of us scooter riders, please do so.

                                                                    Thank-you for taking the time to read this.
                                                                         Sincerely,
                                                                                               Mike G.

Dear Governor Purdue:

Re: Gay Marriage and Governmental Interference in Citizens' Civil Rights in Reference to the Ban on Gay Marriage

If we, as as a people, have advanced so far in this day and age, why is this still such a big issue and why are gay, lesbian, and bisexual people penalized and treated like second class citizens?  Overall, gay people are productive, hard working and honest members of the community.  I  know I have been.  I have paid taxes for many years and unfortunately, I am not represented in full. I am denied the ability to claim married on my taxes, therefore I pay a higher rate to the government. I am therefore discriminated against. Why should I and my partner have to pay more in taxes because of discriminatory policy and rules and get fewer benefits? I also pay city and county taxes.  Where are OUR rights? This is taxation without representation, and in the past caused a rebellion called the Boston Tea Party. I could lose my job because of who I love and there is nothing in the law to protect me. If I am not treated equally, then I should either not have to pay taxes or pay a lesser amount, being that I am not getting the benefits that I am entitled to.  This travesty is not much different than the fight for racial civil rights of the past.

Where is the separation of church and state, and how dare our government (the one WE fund with OUR tax dollars) regulate my personal life with their morals based on their religious beliefs?  I happen to be a Christian, and gay although many don't seem to think that is possible, but I know better.  I know my relationship and place with God and I know that He loves me and accepts me as I am, but that is really none our government's business.  I am the only one that will stand before the judgment seat of Christ for myself and my actions.  How can our government get into the judgment business?  That is exactly what you are doing by supporting the legislation that takes away rights of citizens.  And it is not your right or responsibility.  I think God is frustrated and angry that His words are twisted and used to war against people. All people are created in his image. It is time to start loving God's creation. Stop the hate. Love your neighbor as yourself. That is scripture.

Most people know gay people, whether they know that they are gay or not.  Many gay people live in fear, being afraid of rejection, retaliation and bullying, and even hate crimes.  People should not have to live an oppressed life out of fear, but with the mindset of many people out there, they do live in fear. Things need to change.  I think God is frustrated and angry that His words are twisted and used to war against people. All people are created in his image. It is time to start loving God's creation. Stop the hate. Love your neighbor as yourself. That is scripture.  It is not your place to regulate based on your religious beliefs, although I know sometimes it is difficult to separate the two.  How on earth would marriage or civil commitment take away anything from marriage between a man and a woman?  Why is there such a fear of it.  Is the public in general afraid that their spouse might leave them for someone of the same sex?  I don't understand how civil unions or marriages of gay people could undermine marriage in general.

Whether you agree with a person's sexuality, they should still have the same civil rights of any other citizen.  Gay people are NOT asking for special treatment.  Gay people are only asking to be treated the same as the rest of society and allowed to live their lives in peace.  Equal rights is not being treated specially, just being treated equally and enjoying the same rights as everyone else.  If you don't stand up for the rights of others, who will stand up for yours?

"In Germany, they came first for the Communists, And I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Communist; And then they came for the trade unionists, And I didnt speak up because I wasnt a trade unionist; And then they came for the Jews, And I didnt speak up because I wasnt a Jew; And then . . . they came for me . . . And by that time there was no one left to speak up."  -- Martin Niemoller
Below is food for thought....please read:

>> THANK you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him or her that Leviticus 18:22 clearly state it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to follow them. My important Biblically based questions are listed below. I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help.
>> 
>> 1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to the Irish, but not English people. Can you clarify? Why can't I own some Englishmen?
>> 
>> 2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?
>> 
>> 3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence.
>> 
>> 4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is: my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?
>> 
>> 5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?
>> 
>> 6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I do not agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination?
>> 
>> 7. Lev.21:20 state that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wriggle-room here?
>> 
>> 8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?
>> 
>> 9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?
>> 
>> 10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev.19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

Now, seriously, first of all, the point that the 10 questions makes is that you cannot pick and choose which of God's laws you are going to enforce and also show that many of them are outdated. By outdated, I mean that Christians are no longer under the law of the old testiment. The New Testiment says very clearly that no one could keep the law (all sin and fall short of the glory of God) and therefore God created another plan....one of mercy and grace for ALL. So, even though the questions were done "tongue-in-cheek" they do show that there people pick and choose the laws that work for them and their causes and beliefs. You can't have it both ways. And technically, in the Christian texts, there is only one thing that a person must do to enter the kingdom of heaven, and that is believe on Jesus Christ. The bible states, "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life" (Jn 6:47), said Jesus.   I say to you that if God knows us before we are formed, then do you think He is suprised that some people are gay and that many would argue that they are "formed" that way?

I think God is frustrated and angry that His words are twisted and used to war against people. All people are created in his image. It is time to start loving God's creation. Stop the hate. Love your neighbor as yourself. That is scripture.
Since so many are determined to reference the bible to argue against homosexuality, according to the Old Testament, David and Jonathan has a relationship and by reading the text below, it sound like more than friendship, and many scholars agree.
> "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle." 1 Samuel 18:1-4
Even at least one of our Presidents were thought to have been gay.  President James Buchanan, was thought to be be gay Andrew Jackson referred to him, in the homophobic humor of the time, as Miss Nancy.  President Abraham Lincoln, was rumored to be either gay or bi and kept his private life very low profile as a young lawyer, he spent four years sharing a bed with a handsome shopkeeper named Joshua Steed.

You will be surprised at how some of the people in history (and currently as well) were gay, lesbian or bisexual.  To see a list go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.  What kind of world would it have been without these creative, artistic and inventive people?  Think of all their accomplishments! The funny thing is, many if not most of these people were held in high esteem and had rights in their societies.  I am certain that everyone has benefited in some way from them, whether it is Leonardo da Vinci's scientific and engineering works (and his art) or one of the writers' or artists' art or the music of someone that is gay. 

There have been so many gay people of importance in history.  Some are:

"Bill would screen for aliens" taking American jobs created from the stimulus package.  This should have been front page news and not tucked away in the Triangle & State section - 11B.

Every American should call their lawmakers and make sure that this legislation is passed (E-Verify) to ensure that only AMERICANS get the new jobs that will be created from American taxpayers dollars.

E-Verify is crucial - now more that ever. 

Stand up and be heard - protect the rights of legal American citizens.

Greetings.



The power of the pen!  I am sure this is a great piece of legislation  a bill that lays the foundation for a major restructuring of our state education leadership.  Senate Bill 198 paves the way for Dr. Bill Harrison to serve as both CEO of our states public schools and Chair of the State Board.  I do not know all the behind the scenes moves of this bill but I must let you know that I feel that my vote was wasted in voting for the States Education Superintendent.  I am confused and do not understand whats the strategy behind this and so many others that I have spoken with at the grassroots level.



Just to let you know, many are feeling disenfranchised.  And the other annoying thing is using the lottery proceeds to balance the budget?

Please consider the democratic ideal of free and fair elections and oppose H.R. 800.  If passed, this bill will result in unfair pressure and coercion by union organizers who will be able to pressure otherwise opposed workers to sign the union cards.  This will harm the competitiveness of US industry and be particularly harmful to already depressed industries in North Carolina.  Please support the right to private, uncoerced voting for all Americans.

Thank you,

S-155: community colleges canât admit illegal aliens. The bill: S-155 would require students at community colleges to be lawful residents of the United States.

This bill's primary sponsor is Sen. Phil Berger.  Senator Berger and his associates should be applauded for standing up for the rights of legal, tax paying citizens. 

Illegal aliens should not be rewarded for breaking our laws..  Granting illegal aliens acceptance into our college system would be a slap in the face to every American following the laws of this great country. 

Last year North Carolina spent 1 Billion for the care and welfare of illegal aliens.   Including:  Medical (ER's, Doctors and Hospital care), Welfare (anchor babies), Medicaid/Medicare, Food Stamps, Education and Incarceration. 

America needs to know at all times who is in USA.  Our borders need to be secured and those who enter this country illegally deported.

Hon. Beverley Perdue:

Even during tough times you are showing your commitment to education in North Carolina.

That is the reason why I am letting you know that I support HB-362 - Access to Higher Education, to make sure that generations of talented and motivated students can attend colleges and universities regardless of their immigrations status.  Within these students we find many valedactorians, highe GPA, and young people eager to contribue to the best of their abilities now and to the future of North Carolina and this nation.  They have proven so by the mere fact that they are graduating from their high schools.

We should not make their future uncertain but rather let them achieve to their potential.

Thank you for your hard work,

Best Regards,
Olma Echeverri

Morning Governor Perdue:

I am a retired Register of Deeds for Edgecombe County. I am asking for your help regarding the above named Senate Bill. If passed, the bill will greatly harm the retired registers of this state as well as future retirees. The Register of Deeds Retirement Fund was created explicitly for the use of registers retirement benefits. There are ample funds in the account for every register to continue to receive the current retirement amount of $1500 monthly. In addition, monies are deposited in the account every month by every county in the state. There are no financial issued to warrant a reduction in the retirement benefits to deserving registers.
To my knowledge, there are no pending bills attempting to reduce benefits for Sheriffs, Judges, District Attorneys, Clerks of Courts or other elected officials. I feel this bill is discriminatory and should be stopped.
I ask you to please help us in any way that you can.

My Sincere Appreciation,

Judy W. Cole

Subject: Tony Rand proposal

Comment: Governor Purdue, I am very concerned with the proposal by Tony Rand to require mail order drugs. What kind of a payoff is he receiving from the PBM's? I truly thought this administration from the president to state government was concerned about the ordinary person and small businesses. No only are the drug companies, PBM's, and insurance companies telling us what doctor to see, what medicine we can and cannot take, now they are telling us we must get our medicine from mail order. Who is going to regulate these mail order companies? I would like to know who is filling my prescription and that the drugs are bing taken proper care of during the process, such as refrigeration. DO WE HAVE A VOICE IN RALEIGH? Thank you, Rita M. Busbee

Madam Governor and Elected Officials of Alamance Co.:

After further digging and a call from State Representative Cary Allred,  I believe that  House Bill 423 will be part of a helpful solution for Senior citizens who want to stay in their homes, which I understand is our current official policy.
Please look at this Bill and give it you complete support, as I feel it is both necessary and humane!
I want to thank Representative Allred for introducing this desperately needed legislation and for his courteous return of my call yesterday afternoon.
I strongly believe if all public and private citizens follow their moral compasses in this time of economic trial, we will at least be able to get some sleep at night.
I invite any thoughts that you may have on this issue pro or con. 
I will also inform you that a fight for our Seniors is one that will never go away.

please take a minute to help save our most important food systems. just read and respond! hope all is lovely!



>> Hello,
>> 
>> I don't usually do much politicking, but this bill if passed could put a sudden and dramatic end to a way of life that many of us are committed to.  If you farm, know a farmer or enjoy eating food that is grown outside of the corporate industrial (GMO, pesticide, herbicide, antibiotic laden, etc...) model I encourage you to read this piece of legislation and act on it quickly.  There are less than two weeks before the machinery to end family farming in this country may get the green light from our elected representatives.  Please pass this along to anyone you think might care.  Thank you!

Dear Governor,

I have been trying for 2 years to help assure Veterans with 100% disability be exempt from property taxes. There are numerous other states that already give 100% tax exemption. North Carolina need to also value our US veterans that put there lives on the line to protect the freedoms we have today and future.  Last year I contacted everyone in the Senate and House including the Finance Committee. I had very ones approval of HB-486 someone pulled a fast one and combined two bills together which in return only gave us less then half of what we where looking for in Bill HB-486.

Last year this is the response from Paul Lueke D-Durham and head of the Finance Committee came back with this response I consulted with our House Finance Committee staff. This bill would take a significant amount of dollars from the General Fund. It is my conclusion that, in its present form, the bill is too expensive. Perhaps you and other supporters of HB 486 could consider, for the 2008 short session, another version of the bill that would be less costly than the current bill.  With best wishes,
Paul Luebke
(D-Durham)

I find this inappropriate response, you can not put a dollar amount on any veteran that severed their county honorably and protect our citizens and country in which our veterans are still feeling the pain from missing Limbs to PTSD the government needs to step up and re-introduce HB-486 to assure are veterans get proper exemptions. Please help to bring some peace of mind back to the veteran, your intervention would let us veterans know that North Carolina takes care of there veterans. Thank you and hope to hear or meet with you to pass this state wide Bill. Please be our hero!!

I want to express my disappointment that some of our representatives are
supporting legislation that would significantly damage North Carolina's
ability to attract, retain and grow good jobs and make the process by which
workplaces are unionized less balanced and fair.
The card check bills in Congress would harm North Carolina employees,
employers and our state's economy by:

1) Denying North Carolina employees their fundamental right to a
secret-ballot vote in deciding whether to join a union - a right they should
be guaranteed.  The union-preferred card check system of unionizing
workplaces exposes employees to intimidation and harassment from union
leaders and allies - both on and off the job.

2) Including binding arbitration provisions that take away employers' right
to make critical and far-reaching decisions about their businesses that
directly impact their ability to remain competitive and keep jobs.  (The
bills destroy any incentive for unions to negotiate reasonably in workplace
that become unionized because when an agreement between unions and employers
is not reached within 120 days, the card check bills would give control of
important workplace decisions to the federal government - taking it away
from both employers and employees.)

3) Making it easier for unions to "unionize" workplaces, which could
eliminate a significant competitive advantage North Carolina has over other
states when it comes to attracting and growing good jobs as the
least-unionized state in the country.

I strongly encourage you to take whatever action necessary to prevent the
"Employee Free Choice Act of 2009" (unions' card check bills) from becoming
law.

Visitor: Mrs. Melissa Johns

Address: 810 Gordon Woods Rd., Wilmington, NC 28411

Email: missyjohns@hotmail.com

Subject: House Bill 539

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I know this is a hectic time for you but I would like to draw your attention to HB 539 to merge M@4 with the PFC. I am a M@4 teacher in a public school and I am concerned about this change. With school system affliation, we are able to serve more at risk children because we provide transportation. Many children would be unable to attend a private center for lack of transportation. We are highly qualified teachers, I just recieved my National Board Certification and we are academically based to best meet the needs of our children and to make the transition from PK to K much smoother for our students. You have called for a seamless PK-12 system, however this bill would take PK out from under DPI and put us under the umbrella of Partnership for Children who run their PK's in child care centers that follow child care guidelines. We follow the NC Foundations curriculum in the public setting and we offer our students programs that they will continue in Kindergarten. We spend time with the K teachers and vice versa learning how to make the transition from PK to K even smoother for our children. Would it be possible to merge the partnership under DPI? What would happen to the teachers that are in the public schools? We would no longer work for our LEA. Would we loose retirement, benefits and salary? These are questions that are not clearly answered in the bill. It is so important for our children that we best serve our state's most at risk students to the best of our abilities. Please do not take the public Pre-K out of DPI. We are an academically focused program as opposed to a child care based model that the Partnership runs. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I truly care about the children in my county and the state and want the best for them that is possible. Thank you for your continued commitment to education. Melissa Johns

Email: wstephenson@ec.rr.com

Subject: House Bill DRH30129-LUf-14A

Comment: I am sending this email to you to voice my concern reference the above mentioned House Bill to merge More at Four with NCPC. I am a Teacher Assistant in New Hanover County and have worked with MAF for four years. What a great program to be a part of! We were made aware of this action last Friday and were, to say the least, shocked. My comments will be brief: The More At Four program is a classroom based educational program for at risk children. Why remove an educational program from the Department of Public Instruction and place it under the direction of a child care based model? Removal would not support Gov. Perdue's desire for a SEAMLESS PK-12 system which would provide a significant advantage to students by applying a consistent educational philosophy for fourteen years. Pre-K in public schools makes for an easier and smoother transition into Kindergarten. We, like our elementary schools, provide instruction in Second Step, Positive Behavior, and Handwriting Without Tears. We focus on preparing our children for success in school through emphasis on literacy, numbers and problem solving. Our teachers are highly qualified, meeting NCLB, and hold North Carolina teaching license. We have National Board Certified teachers on staff. Our children receive a foundation of educational and behavioral expectations that will prepare them for the transition from Pre-K to Kindergarten. A child care based model places more emphasis on the environment and less emphasis on instruction. Local school systems have the ability to hire and train highly qualified teachers who are certified B-K. These teachers are already in place. Will these teachers be kept or will they be replaced with less qualified staff? If the existing staff is kept, will pay remain the same? Will benefits remain the same? I appreciate your time and look forward to further communications with you. Sandra Stephenson wstephenson@ec.rr.com 910-686-7423

Governor Perdue:

I oppose passage of the above bills.  I believe that we should not teach children how to engage in behavior that is immoral.  Teaching children about engaging in sexual activity before marriage is on a par with teaching children how to drive safely at 100 mph.  We just don't want them to do it.  This country continues to accept a lower and lower standard of acceptable morality.  The end result of this has been well demonstrated in history.

Email: searlspts1@bellsouth.net

Subject: House Bill 120

Comment: Governor Purdue, House Bill 120 would expand taxpayer financing of political campaigns to municipal races. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. This bill could for the first time force taxpayers to fund politicians they cannot vote for because they live in a city that does not elect all its representatives on an at-large basis. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. My husband and I are retired and live on a fixed income. Between the increase in income taxes and the pending annexation of my area into the Wilmington City Limits, we and other taxpayers in North Carolina can not take on another burden during this economic crisis. Please abandon House Bill 120 (Public Municipal Campaigns) and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns. Patricia T.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to address the House Bill 539 that wants to merge the More at Four Program with Department of Health and Human Services.  Your support is needed to advocate for this Program to stay under the Department of Public Instruction.  I am a teacher in the More at Four Program for New Hanover County and have seen how the highly qualified and dedicated staff has prepared their students for entry into kindergarten.

Comment: Being able to provide ourselves with a basic need: FOOD - growing our own food and buying locally benefits everyone. Except Big Business and Government. Well what better way to make us completely dependant would be to ban our right to grow our own foods! And with the big "Green" "Organic" trends making people aka consumers spend less on foods from Corp America or Imported food that we can grow here you're now planning to ban us from our right to grow our own food!? a lot of people are buying local from farmers markets, etc. Also the fact that the normal household cannot afford to buy healthy foods. especially with the current economy - So we grow our own. Banning or making it illegal will cut out things like the local farmers markets that are mostly are small farms owned by regular folks. Alot of people who have a small spot in their back yard that grow for themselves and share/trade with friends and family who are struggling. It all boils down to = CONTROL.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #14523] More At Four Program/Department of Health and Human Services Merger

To Whom It May Concern:

I'm writing to you because of concerns I have about House Bill 539. This Bill proposes to merge the More at Four Program and place it under the Department of Health and Human Services. There are so many reasons why this is not in the best interest of the at-risk children the More at Four Program serves. How is this merger in the best interest for the children when it moves them from an educational based program to a daycare center? Even if the daycare center is 4-5 star rated, they are not teaching our kids to prepare them for the 21st century because they give the kids an option on whether or not they want to learn. I state this as fact because the daycare centers do not require highly qualified individuals to teach the children.  In addition to the above statements, you must realize that by removing at-risk children from this program and into the DHHS, you will be tasking the primary and elementary school faculty and staff with teaching children who are not adequately prepared to be there.  This not only hurts the at-risk children, but it also hurts all other children in the classrooms when it takes more teacher attention from them and gives it to the unprepared children.

A goal of the education department of North Carolina is to help advance the children of our state.  This is a vital program that must be maintained and improved to achieve success and moving away from the More at Four program and into a Health and Human Services based program is without-a-doubt a step in the wrong direction.  

The More at Four Program also helps parents because we offer required workshops that are on various topics and are beneficial to the parents and the students. We also require parent involvement where the parent is required to be involved with their child for 1 hour per month at the school. This is an educational enrichment opportunity for the parents and children that is unparalleled. Doing this prepares the parent to be more involved in their child's education when they enter elementary school and beyond; and, it won't seem to be a burden to them because they'll already have the routine and expectation of visiting and checking in with the teacher as well as the child.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for getting to know the More at Four program and understanding why its purpose is different from that of a daycare program and the importance of keeping the program under DPI.  We all understand no program can work without the proper funding, management, and overall leadership; however, know that like running my home, it is important to make the necessary adjustments and changes without sacrificing the most important things that make up the fabric of my family.  More At Four is essential and necessary for the better advancement of all North Carolina's children.

Subject: House Bill #539 Merging More at Four /Smart Start and placing under Health and Human Services

Comment: I understand the need for budget cuts but I cannot understand merging this program and removing it from the DPI. President Obama is very much in favor of programs such as this. Are we not getting stimulus monies for education? What about the lottery? It was to help pay for pre-K,and I would guess that alot of our parents buy lottery tickets instead of taking care of some at-home needs first. I think this is a very serious issue, yes I wish to stay employed but I honestly care about these children and how their lives will change without this program. Please understand that this program is not Daycare, that alone makes such a difference. I was not amused by Rep.Paul Stam's joke that he would give you an incentive to merge,by renaming the programs the "Perdue Phenomenal Program." I hope that you care enough about "at risk" children to make the tough decision to do the right thing and stand firmly behind More at Four regardless of whose name is on the program. This type program helps also in closing the "educational gap" that exists between minority groups. Forgive me for going on but this program is just to good and too important to not fight for!

Subject: NC Child Welfare Education Collaborative

Comment: I am writing in regards to the North Carolina Child Welfare Collaborative Program. House Bill 90 and Senate Bill 33 to further expand the program have also recently been filed. It is my understanding that the expansion, as well as the entire program, are at risk of being eliminated. As a 2009 Child Welfare Scholar, Master of Social Work student and concerned citizen, this information alarms me greatly. The Collaborative Program has provided me with exceptional knowledge and experience in the child welfare arena. I have received specialized training and classes that are tailored to prepare me for a career in child welfare. While I feel that the program increases the number of skilled child welfare workers, thereby responding to the staffing crisis in NC Social Services, my greatest concern is for the larger community. Local agencies are able to recruit and retain more qualified employees as a direct result of this program. Qualified employees have more positive outcomes; impacting the community, its citizens and our state. I have informed my friends, family, colleagues and concerned citizens about this very important matter. I hope that you and your constituents will reconsider and ultimately reinstate and expand this valuable program. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Respectfully, Katie L. Sheets Master of Social Work Student NC Child Welfare Scholar NASW Member KLSheets@uncc.edu

Subject: HB-733

Comment: Good morning Governer Perdue, I know that NC is busy with the economy problems and where to cut and what to leave. Please take a moment and think about what I feel is very important and eventually will effect our economy. The Bill HB733 will be coming before our lawmakers again soon and after reading the proposed bill, I know it will effect many of our purebred dog fanciers in the state and the monies from taxes, purebred shows, Vets of small animals and eventually sales. I do believe there needs to be some type of control but where is the guidance coming from. NC has the honor of having The American Kennel Club, our major registration and education organization in the US, located here in our state. The AKC knows and understands the needs of the dog breeders and I ask that this law be tabled until the AKC can be approached to assist. The knowledgeable officals of the AKC can and willingly assist in a decision that will effect many people from all walks of life that take the care of purebred dogs seriously. Controls of breeding may be needed but a blanket thrown over everyone may not be the best way. I am a Chaplain and counselor working with loss issues especially in our children and purebred dogs are a way for our family to enjoy time together. Thanks you for your time reading and helping make the right decision for NC and its population. Henry Bingham

Please do not allow this bill to move forward.  State employees are already doing more work in fewer hours.  I have to work a part time job now.  If the 20 day furlough is approved, then I will have to get another part time job.  I think 3 jobs is just too many.

Hello my name is Daniella, I was wondering if you could support the dream act. It has been my dream since I was very young to go to college and become a lawyer.(even though I am 15, but 4 more yrs to go to college) and since I heard that that I will soon not be able to go to college, it just broke my heart. Because by allowing this students to pursue higher education, the state can benefit from students who are bilingual and bicultural, and able to contribute to the state´s collective productivity and economic growth. And hope that you will please support this project, you are my last hope, and I hope you will take this inconsideration. Please support the Dream act!

House Bill 708 Furlough

I know this Bill was introduced with good intentions but this Bill does not provide any language to protect employees from discriminatory practices and exposes them to the powers of the EEOC/Administrative Officers of Organizations and/or Facilities.  Therefore, this Bill is unacceptable without protective measures and language inserted.  RIF provisions have such language and RIF also has steps of reduction of hours for employees.  The Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of all employees must be protected at all times, for if not,  it will allow discrimination with no end in sight and lawsuits will follow.  This is reason enough to beg the question:  Why was this bill introduced?  This bill also has the premise of desperation coming from our legislature.  We all know that times are tough but our state employees are stressed and stretched out to the max. 

Please lead by example, cuts need to come from the top first.  What about employees that make one penny more than the $30,000?  They will be furloughed as well. The amount is in need to be set higher, at the minimum $35,000 to $40,000.  Have you been in the grocery store lately?  No raises, rising prices, plus increasing health insurance and and and....you know what I am talking about.  How about encouraging employees to volunteer so they will feel like they make a difference?  How about consolidating jobs?  Heck, I have been working two positions for 8 month's and I do not get paid for it even though policy and NCGS dictates it. 

Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate and save on the benefits you will not have to pay but raise the persons pay that you have consolidated.  I rather work hard and feel like I have accomplished something for the day and also know that I have saved the North Carolina tax payer, which includes me and my children as well, than sit on my laurels as some other state employees do each and every day.  Get rid of the lazy people.  We are tired of doing their jobs and they are getting paid for it.  Pay us and consolidate and save on benefits.  I can not stress this enough.  Again, introduce some protective language into House Bill 708 and treat all employees the same or this bill will most likely be lobbied to death.   

An employee separated through a reduction in force may appeal that separation if it is alleged the separation is in retaliation for the employee's opposition to alleged discrimination on account of the employee's age, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, creed, political affiliation, or handicapping condition. Such an appeal may be made either through the agency internal grievance procedure or may be filed directly with the Office of Administrative Hearings, at the choice of the employee.

In accordance with federal guidelines affecting equal employment opportunity and affirmative action, all decisions concerning reduction-in-force must be analyzed to determine their impact on agency utilization goals by race and sex and to avoid adverse impact in violation of Section 4.d of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

Cordially,

The IRS Earned Income Credit limit should be a good dollar amount indicator for people that should be furloughed, meaning the ones that make above it, also meaning it should increase in the amount the IRS has set for each tax year.  Really good Guideline (most of us have at least one or two children).  Also, where possible, the so much hated 10 hour four day work week should be implemented for it saves electrical power and it saves the employees a one day roundtrip worth of gasoline.  No better time than now and trust you me that many regular citizens would be more than happy not having to take hours off from work to take care of some business they can only take car of from 8:00 am through 5:00 pm Monday through Friday.  I know that is not possible everywhere but it is possible in most of our agencies and departments.  Think outside the box and apply what is, hmmm, the obvious.  Try something that never has been done before than cut cut cut, for you will cut yourselves out of the best employees you ever had and that will include me if it keeps going like it is and most employees already are saying that they will never work for the state again once they leave to go somewhere else and I am talking about people that have worked for the state a long time 10 and 15 years and plus.  So think, for panic only leads to things that are not thought through and the state will end up keeping all the losers and loosing all the keepers.

Hello, my name is Allison Mercurio and I am from Wake Forest to ask you to support S.B. 460/H.B. 733, legislation to crack down on puppy mills. As a constituent, I am very concerned about large scale breeding and the inhumane treatment of dogs in puppy mills. Thank you.
