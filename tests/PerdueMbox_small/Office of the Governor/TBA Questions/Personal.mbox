Subject: Fund raising

Comment: Curious about your position on money being raised from the much touted birthday bash fund raiser. This is certainly falls in the perception of impropriety that followed your predecessor. Are NC citizens to expect more of the same from you?

Glad to be on the list and to hear where you are!  She's off to a great start. Where is Don Hobart?

FYI, I am running for Wake County Party Chair.  When you get settled, call me for lunch.

First Day of Change
Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.

As the first order of business as Governor, Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx> that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

 1.  Governor's Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

 1.  Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business - putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

 1.  Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

 1.  On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

 1.  Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.


Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (eTownhall<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Subject: 16-yr Old Onslow County Youth Wins Major Award

Comment: Dear Honorable Governor Perdue: Just wanted to inform you that one your 16-yr old Onslow County youth won the world renown STELLAR GOSPEL MUSIC AWARD! So that you can understand the magnitude of winning such an award as this--it is equivalent to the Grammy, Dove, People's Choice, and Country Music Awards--but on the gospel side! KAIRA MILLER, a junior at Southwest-Onslow High School, won the STELLAR GOSPEL CHILDREN'S PERFORMER OF THE YEAR-2009" AWARD at the Grand Ole Opryland on Saturday, January 17, 2009. I wish you could have been there to see how Kaira, 16 yrs old, was so elegant and poised as she approached the awesome stage to receive her Stellar trophy and give her acceptance speech like a seasoned vet! The very first thing she did, after publicly announcing that she was so nervous, was to GIVE ALL HONOR TO GOD, and then thanked her parents and family, Bishop A.G. & Co-Pastor Mullen and her Abundant Life Church Family, Jacksonville, NC; as well as Mr. Chris Batts & Steve Spraggins of Vinelife Productions, etc. Kaira Miller and her family are natives of Jacksonville (Onslow County), North Carolina! She has put us on the map! On January 24, 2009, the 2009 Stellar Gospel Music Pre-Awards Show will be aired on the www.rushmoredrive.com website where you will be able to see Kaira. The Stellar Gospel Music Awards will be aired in our viewing area on Sunday, March 1st on the Gospel Music Channel (Time Warner Channel 132 & Direct-TV Channel 338) More photos from this wonder Stellar Award weekend is uploaded to Kaira's MySpace page at www.myspace.com/kairamiller for your viewing pleasure! Honorable Governor Perdue, for an honor such as this, don't you think Kaira has earned a college scholarship or key to the State? I think some type of special acknowledgement from the Governor of our wonderful State would be an added touch. May God bless you and again, CONGRATULATIONS TO KAIRA!

Comment: $1500 per month !! If you didn't have e-mail, faxes, scanning capabilities, Blackberrys, telephones, a stable and deficit free economy...maybe the expense would be acceptable. But you have all those tools for communication with an unstable economy. Please give me your rationale for that wasteful spending.
