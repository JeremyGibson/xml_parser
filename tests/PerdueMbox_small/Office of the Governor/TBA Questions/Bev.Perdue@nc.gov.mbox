Hello Governor,

I know that you have a passion for helping our youth.  I have a non-profit program that targets at risk youth and gives them the opportunity to belong, be creative, and enhance their skills.  It is a program called D.R.E.A.M. (Destiny Realized Empowered And Manifested) it is a program that teaches our youth about entrepreneurship, goal setting, time management, and leadership.  I am unsure of what funding is available; however, I know that this program will make a great impact in our children.  It is my desire to offer it at a greater level and see a change come about and our drop out rate decreased. 

I look forward from hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,


Mindy A Butler, BS
