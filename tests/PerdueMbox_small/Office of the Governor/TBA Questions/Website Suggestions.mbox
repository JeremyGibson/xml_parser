Thank you for your response.  May I make a sugggestion regarding your "Constituent Services" link on the web page?

Once the submit button has been pressed the next page has only a "data submitted" message with the submit button still in clear view.  I found it confusing and ended up pressing submit again, thereby sending your office the same message twice.  Instead of "data submitted"  how about a clearer confirmation message that lets the user know for sure their message has been sent?

Other than that, nice website!

Subject: Website Comments

Comment: Webmaster, I was happy to learn that one of the first things that Gov Perdue did was create a website. I am 17 years old and have always desired that kind of basic, direct connection with my government. The website, in addition, looks sleek and professional. My personal experience with websites and their development extends beyond simply being a user. I have worked for years as a webmaster, as well as an accessibility tester. Using this background, I would like to comment on the various pages of the website. 1. "Appointments" My only complaint for this page is two PDFs. I am coming from the opinion that PDFs should be official documents, and/or documents that need to look a very specific way (ie forms, catalogs, etc). The first PDF, a list of all the boards and commissions, (which has a singular "board" in the link text) truly has nothing but a list of names for 2 pages. Could this not be done on a webpage? Additionally, the description of each board, while more accessible if on a webpage or series of webpages, is understandably in a PDF. My concern, though, is the inapparent order of the boards. There is no alphabetical order, so one is left clicking the "PgDn" button hoping to find the board one is looking for. 2. "Contact Us" I say "Contact Us" because that is the tab I clicked on to reach the eTownhall portion of the website. There is no mention of "Contact Us" on this portion of the site. I will comment on it further later in the note. 3. "Council of State" I like the look of this page. It is neat and organized. The pictures are professional. The information is clear and aparent. The position titles (ie "Lieutenant Governor") could be a bit darker in color, for the hard of seeing. Otherwise, it looks very nice. 4. eTownhall: Why is this a seperate layout? Besides, the layout looks stretched. The graphics are too tall. Over 50% of the page's height is navigation/banner. Also "your turn to get involved"? Wouldn't "your chance...", "your way..." or even "your forum..." more precisely articulate the sentiment? "your turn" seems aggressive and finger-pointing, as if we haven't taken up the burden of getting involved before now. Anyway, this section has a blog, 3 different contact forms, and Town Halls information. Can't you condense the contact forms in to one? And add "Blog" and "Town Halls" to the main navigation? 4a. The Blog The point of a blog is familiarity. Even the word "blog" is a familiar-ized version of "web log". This is a great opportunity for the governor to put down a common view of her--well, politicians in general: the superficiality. Unfortunately, the blog feels incredibly superficial. First of all, the background image is irritating. It would be "kind of cool" if the lines on the image matched up with the text spacing. The fact that it doesn't both looks awkward and makes reading difficult. Second of all, the actual text of the blog is somewhere between a cutesy press release and a exhaustable marketing ploy. Please, if you're going to have a blog, have a blog. Otherwise, have a daily "What the Governor did today" and a bulleted answer. If I want a press release, I'll go to the press. 4b. Q&A Technical problem: toggling the inputs works until "Zip", which toggles directly to "Comments" (past E-mail and Subject). "E-mail" being out of the tab order has applied to all of the contact and register forms I have found. Thank you for taking the time to read my comments, Julianna Langston Cary, NC

Webmaster,
I was happy to learn that one of the first things that Gov Perdue did was create a website. I am 17 years old and have always desired that kind of basic, direct connection with my government. The website, in addition, looks sleek and professional.
My personal experience with websites and their development extends beyond simply being a user. I have worked for years as a webmaster, as well as an accessibility tester. Using this background, I would like to comment on the various pages of the website, <<http://www.governor.state.nc.us>www.governor.state.nc.us>.
1. "Appointments"
My only complaint for this page is two PDFs. I am coming from the opinion that PDFs should be official documents, and/or documents that need to look a very specific way (ie forms, catalogs, etc). The first PDF, a list of all the boards and commissions, (which has a singular "board" in the link text) truly has nothing but a list of names for 2 pages. Could this not be done on a webpage?
