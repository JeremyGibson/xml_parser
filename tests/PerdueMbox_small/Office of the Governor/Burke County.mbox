 I am a citizen of Burke county, NC and I need your help. I am sure that you have been made aware of the chaos that has overcome my county. The uproar over the school board has overwhelmed our community and has reached a level that you must now address. As you MUST know our county is in jeopardy of losing our accreditation. This would be only the second school EVER to lose this. Now I am sure that being a new governor in such a crucial time you will look into this matter. Ms. Perdue, you have the power to remove this board or at the very least call them and ask all to resign. I am sure you understand the importance of all our children having the best possible education. If our schools lose accreditation their futures will be bleak. I am a fellow state employee. The budget is already being balanced on my back. Does my daughter have to suffer even more by attending a failing school system? The children NEED and expect your help. It is your responsibility to lead, to govern and to correct this issue. Act now!



Sincerely,

Samantha Shaver

Ms. Perdue,
    As a citizen of Burke County and resident of North Carolina, I urge you to become involved in the situation facing us regarding education in Burke County.  Most certainly you are aware of the concerns involving the actions of  five members of our school board and the termination of David Burleson's contract.  However, with the possibility of our schools losing accreditation, I am urging you to become involved and make public comment on the issue.  As was done in Clayton, GA, as Govenor, you can help resolve this situation before the schools lose accreditation and adversely effecting the students in our county. 

Thank you for time on this matter,

Jennifer Deacon

Governor Beverly Purdue,

The Burke County Board of Education has received a letter from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI).  Our High Schools are at risk of losing their accreditation which could affect our students' applications to certain colleges and universities.  I am a product of the Burke County School System and I was fortunate to attend and graduate with honors from Wake Forest University.  I can not imagine my children not having the same opportunity because the majority of our local school board (Tracy Norman, Tim Buff, Rob Hairfield, David Bernard and Karen Sain) is not acting professionally and is using poor judgement in making decisions that affect the welfare of our children.  It makes me sick to hear about this suspected deterioration of our county schools from the SACS CASI when our principals, teachers, staff, students and Superintendent Mr. David Burleson are working harder than ever.  The fact that David Burleson's contract was not renewed after 27 years of excellent service to Burke County is a disgrace!! 

WE NEED YOU, our N.C. state leadership, to help us during this crisis. Please stand up for our children and help us fix this out-of-control situation with our school board.  The complaints and concerns listed on the SACS CASI letter are directly related to the misuse of power and poor decision making of the majority of our school board (the 5 names listed above).  We need these members removed.

Please help the Burke County Schools.  We NEED your support and help!!!

Sincerely,
Kelly Gessner

Governor Purdue,



I am writing because I am concerned about the future of the Burke County school system. I am a parent of a third grade student and registered voter from Burke County.  I grew up in Burke County and was educated in its school system.  I went on to graduate from UNC-Charlotte in 1991.  I could have lived anywhere; however, I decided to move back to Morganton because I wanted to raise a family in the same small town fashion I knew well.  I knew that Morganton was a safe, friendly and supportive community, with good schools and good teachers.  Unfortunately, that all seems to be changing right in front of my eyes.  I am sure you are aware of the issues that surround our current School Board and their decision to break Superintendent Burleson’s contract and let him go.  In brief, five of the elected School Board officials have caused a mockery of our school system and continue to defy common sense. 



The current school Superintendent, David Burleson, was a teacher at Freedom High School when I was a student there.  I have known Mr. Burleson for some 25 years, and that entire time I have known him to be a strong supporter of the children he either taught or administered.  He has dedicated his entire life to our community and our children   and has accomplished much during his service as superintendent of our county schools.  The school board has in the last month decided without reason to end Mr. Burleson’s contract even against strong protest from parents and voters.  They have restricted public comment at meetings and held meetings in rooms that would not accommodate the number of citizens that have attended.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought we lived in the United States, and that one of our rights is the freedom to publicly voice our opinions, free speech or some silly thing like that. This same school board has attempted to ban books from our public schools, and limited comments at those meetings as well.  This nonsense has gone far enough. 



Lastly, I want my daughter, Samantha, to learn about justice and our constitutional rights in school.  Sadly, she is now learning about injustice and tyranny from a school board who believes they stand above the law.  However the school board feels we need a way to let them know they are not above the law and they are misrepresenting the public which wrongly put them in office.



Mr. Burleson has the support of parents, voters, county and city officials, the county commissioners and more importantly the teachers and students of Burke County.  I am writing to solicit your advice and or assistance in this matter. We are concerned the actions of the school board will have a far deeper impact on our school system, including the threat of losing accreditation for our high schools.  A response from your office and the NC State Board of Education is greatly appreciated and needed.  The Burke County School Board is holding a meeting Monday May 4th; we look forward to hearing from you prior to this meeting.  Thank you for your time and consideration of my concerns and the concerns of my fellow citizens during this crisis. 



Sincerely,

Kim Woolard

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have tried to remain impartial in the current Burke County School Board decisions as of late.

I write you to inform you that I no longer believe that to be a wise decision. Five members of our school board have made some very bad decisions recently and I am deeply concerned that their lack of common sense and the ability to make coherent decisions is about to manifest into a public safety nightmare. Someone is going to be hurt here unless someone has the power to step in and remove these members of our school board.

They continue to prove daily that their ability to make sound decisions is non existent.

Yesterday, the Chief of Police, myself (The Sheriff), the city and county attorney and the city and county managers met with the Chairperson of the Burke County School Board, Tracy Norman. We had to virtually demand the following:

1. The School Board move their meetings to a larger venue.

2. Unlimited public comment be allowed regarding their recent decisions.

We as a group of government officials here in Burke County felt that these measures are imperative to try to ensure the public safety of the citizens attending the school board meetings and the School Board itself.

The Sheriff's Office here in Burke County has just received a Civil Summons on the School Board Chairperson Tracy Norman and the School Board Attorney. The summons is actually a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief against these two for decisions made by this school board in the past several weeks.

I encourage each of you to look at this situation carefully and if there is any possible action that you could impose against these 5 school board members. Burke County needs help before someone is injured or killed.

Sincerely,

Sheriff John T. McDevitt

Governor,



I feel sure that you are aware of the events unfolding in Burke County.



As a Parent and Business Owner, I am deeply concerned about this situation.

I have been to several Board meetings and I have been shocked as to how this Board conducts business.

You would really need to see it to believe it. We need to a clean slate. Please know from the parents perspective, this is NOT a partisan issue.

This is an issue about the education of our children.



I respectfully ask that you remove this Board and allow us to hold a special election to replace them.



I honestly do not know how you would go about removing them; I just know it needs to happen.



I am also concerned that Burke and the surrounding counties image will be tarnished. What business would move into an unaccredited school district?



Please help us!



I look forward to hearing back from you soon.



Thank you.



Best Regards,

Hello!  I am a parent and citizen of Morganton, NC.  I am in full support of keeping David Burleson as our superintendent of our schools in Burke County.  We have a corrupt school board who are out for their own agendas and are not listening to the people of our community.  We are becoming a laughing stock of the media and those who watch.  We received a letter from the SACS CASI stating we are at risk of losing our accreditation.  We need your help. Our community is all supporting David Burleson.  How can these 5 board members run this way?


Sincere Regards,

Kelly Bowers-Messenheimer

Burke County Board of Education has receivied a letter from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School
Improvement (SACS CASI). Because of actions of the elected Burke County School Board, our high schools are now at risk of losing their accreditation. This not only impacts students' applications to certain colleges and universities, but it also also negatively impacts our community as a whole.  We need state leadership to investigate and resolve this crisis which threatens the future of our children and our community.
Below are contents of the letter from SACS CASI:
The letter indicates that a complaint was received alleging violations  under AdvancED  and SACS CASI standards, including but not limited to:

* Standard 1 - Vision and Purpose
* Standard 2 - Governance and Leadership
* Standard 6 - Stakeholders Communications and Relationships
* Standard 7 - Commitment to Continuous Improvement

It states that the Complaint and a review of other public information revealed several troublesome incidents including but not limited to the following:

* The Board's lack of control during a November Board meeting where the 
Board was scheduled to have a first reading of a Book Banning policy.  Public recordings appear to indicate that the Board was apparently upset that 38 students signed up  to speak regarding this issue.  Board members reportedly discussed tracing emails  to determine who organized the students and made the statements that after the 3rd  student speaks there would be no need for further comment because no one would have  anything new to add to the discussion.
* The audio of the November meeting appears to include a statement allegedly attributed to Robert Hairfield, where it sounds as if he makes the statement, "To 
shoot to kill if necessary".  This statement appears to be made in reference to the unruly crowd that was present at the meeting.  However, it is unclear as to who
he is addressing the comment to or the full context of the conversation.
 * On April 6, 2009, two Board members requested that a Board member be  frisked during the Board meeting for a weapon.
* Racist emails were sent by Board member Robert Hairfield containing  racist, discriminatory and inflammatory content.
* The termination of the superintendent's contract without allowing for  public comment and apparently in contradiction to the recommendation of the Board's 
attornery.
The letter continues on to require a response within thirty days of the  letter. The letter is dated April 24, 2009.  That response will then be carefully reviewed by SACS CACI to determine if further action is warranted.  The letter is  signed by Donna James, Ed.D, State Director.

Dear Governor Purdue,



As I’m sure you know, the people of Burke County are dismayed with the Board of Education actions and decisions that have been occurring.  As a retired teacher, I have seen many things occur that I found to be questionable and of concern, but nothing to compare with the current situation.  It is difficult to believe that in a democracy, we could find ourselves with our hands so tied in this bad situation.  I have attended the meetings for over a year and each time I know I wouldn’t believe it if I were not there.  I also wonder if they can possibly top themselves, and they continue to do so.



It is my hope that in your position that you can encourage legislation to allow for a recall vote of the people to undo such a wrong.  I also hope that you will consider using your powers to remove these members from their positions.  We know that the governor of Georgia did that after Clayton County lost its accreditation.  I hope you will not stand by and allow Burke County schools to go that far before necessary moves are made.



The good news in all of this is that at long last, the electorate is seeing the need to be involved.  I don’t think we’ll see low turn out again in Burke elections.



Your consideration is appreciated.



Sincerely,

Linda McCrary

       I am writing on behalf of Burke County Public Schools.  As I am sure you are well aware of the situation in our county, it has recently gone from being an unbelievably bad decision to an actual 3-ring circus.  We have 5 members on our school board who are completely out of control.  They are supposed to represent this county's school system- children, parents, teachers.  They came into office with their own agendas and are trying to force our current School Superintendent, David Burleson, out of office. 
       He has an open personnel file that shows nothing that would indicate anything less than a stellar job. He has served our school system for years. Mr. Burleson was my principal in Jr. High as well as High School. Since graduating from college, I have had the privledge of serving on several community boards with him.  I also have two children in the public schools, where he is a constant fixture-- awards ceremonies, open houses, sporting events, fundraisers, etc. I have often wondered if the man actually ever got to sleep!!!
        The latest drama being that we may loose accredidation at our high schools! We have had protests, rallies, students are staging walk-outs, angry billboards at restaurants, threats in the newspaper and online videos, etc. all in an effort for the parents and students to be considered by this board who will NOT listen.
         Mr. Burleson has a PhD and he is having to answer to a board with whom no one has a college education; several of them have GED's. I realize this is very difficult. This madness has got to stop, please consider a way to PROTECT our children. Thank you for your diligence in this matter.

> Our County is in outrage over the recent way the the elected school board decided without warning to let the superintendent be terminated before his contract is up. There have been no reasons why and David Burleson an educator for 27 years is at risk for losing his retirement benefits. For the last five years, there has been an increasing hidden agenda that come forward. The public either did not have knowledge or allowed issues to happen, but this announcement had caught everyone off guard and the public are tired with decisions that are wrong. Now, its time that the government step in. The school system is at risk for losing accreditation and the students are upset and suffering from the situation. With the economy and many teaching positions being cut, sports, Lacrosse and Field Hockey have been cut from the high school level and now, there will a very large law suit that the tax payers will pay unless someone steps in. Please look into what is happening in our county, we need help.. There needs to be an undated policy. As a burke county resident, its really hard for me to understand why 7 members of a county who have not had the education or experience to have so much power over a state run school system. Tracey Norman the chair, continues to investigate anyone who may be a school teacher or any student who desires to speak at a public meeting, she is asking if any teacher prompted them to show up, it's not her role to try scare tactics. Everyone as citizens have the right to speak up. Now I think its your role as governor and who supports the public schools to stand up and protect what is yours.

I am a 2009 high school honor graduate at East Burke High School and will attend North Carolina State Univeristy this fall.  I will soon be a registered voter..  I am contacting you in hopes you can help our schools.



We desperately need your help in Burke County . Our high schools are at risk of losing their accreditation because of the actions of the BCPS Board of Education.  We need your immediate help!  We need our state's leadership in Burke County to help us during this crisis. When will you join us in standing up for our children?



Thank you.

Governor Purdue,



I am writing because I am concerned about the future of the Burke County school system. I am a parent of a third grade student and registered voter from Burke County.  I grew up in Burke County and was educated in its school system.  I went on to graduate from UNC-Charlotte in 1991.  I could have lived anywhere; however, I decided to move back to Morganton because I wanted to raise a family in the same small town fashion I knew well.  I knew that Morganton was a safe, friendly and supportive community, with good schools and good teachers.  Unfortunately, that all seems to be changing right in front of my eyes.  I am sure you are aware of the issues that surround our current School Board and their decision to break Superintendent Burleson’s contract and let him go.  In brief, five of the elected School Board officials have caused a mockery of our school system and continue to defy common sense. 



The current school Superintendent, David Burleson, was a teacher at Freedom High School when I was a student there.  I have known Mr. Burleson for some 25 years, and that entire time I have known him to be a strong supporter of the children he either taught or administered.  He has dedicated his entire life to our community and our children   and has accomplished much during his service as superintendent of our county schools.  The school board has in the last month decided without reason to end Mr. Burleson’s contract even against strong protest from parents and voters.  They have restricted public comment at meetings and held meetings in rooms that would not accommodate the number of citizens that have attended.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought we lived in the United States, and that one of our rights is the freedom to publicly voice our opinions, free speech or some silly thing like that. This same school board has attempted to ban books from our public schools, and limited comments at those meetings as well.  This nonsense has gone far enough. 



Lastly, I want my daughter, Samantha, to learn about justice and our constitutional rights in school.  Sadly, she is now learning about injustice and tyranny from a school board who believes they stand above the law.  However the school board feels we need a way to let them know they are not above the law and they are misrepresenting the public which wrongly put them in office.



Mr. Burleson has the support of parents, voters, county and city officials, the county commissioners and more importantly the teachers and students of Burke County.  I am writing to solicit your advice and or assistance in this matter. We are concerned the actions of the school board will have a far deeper impact on our school system, including the threat of losing accreditation for our high schools.  A response from your office and the NC State Board of Education is greatly appreciated and needed.  The Burke County School Board is holding a meeting Monday May 4th; we look forward to hearing from you prior to this meeting.  Thank you for your time and consideration of my concerns and the concerns of my fellow citizens during this crisis. 



Sincerely,

Kim Woolard

Dear Governor Purdue,
You being a former teacher, you of all people should know that our children in Burke County are not being served well with the actions of the 4 shool board members,(Norman, Buff, Sain, and Hairfield).  Thank God that Barnard resigned.
I haved lived in this county for 58 years and have two daughters that are teachers.  Please look into this manner and see if there is a way to help.
If we can inpeach a president for wrong doing, then there should be a way to get rid of 4 people that are not serving the people that elected them. 

Thank you,
Warren Scott

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am sure your office has been absolutely inundated with letters from concerned citizens of Burke County.  We are all very, very concerned about our current school board and their actions.

You are aware that the SACS CASI has sent notification of their concerns regarding our school system.  Our superintendent has 30 days to respond.  

The problems listed in their letter are very similar to the problems seen in Clayton County Georgia. Their accreditation was pulled August 2008.

When our problems with this board started a few months ago I thought we could just take care of this with the next election and that would solve most of the problems.  With this new development however, it is much more urgent and we need help quickly.

Our board has also been notified by the ACLU that they have been acting carelessly regarding the citizens civil rights by not allowing us to speak regarding school system issues.  

We have a meeting tonight and hopefully will allow the citizens to speak regarding all of these issues.  

Even if tonight's meeting goes well, we still have the issue of SACS CASI.

I hope that you can help Burke County with this extremely urgent issue.
The governor of Georgia fired the Clayton County School board....after accreditation was pulled.  I hope that you can act before we loose our accreditation.


Respectfully,

Sue Holler

As a concerned citizen of Burke County, would certainly appreciate anything that may do to straighten out the current untenable situation with our County Board of Education.  If drastic measures are warranted, please take them.

We can ill afford to have our young people placed "in harm's way."

Dear Governor Perdue:
I fully appreciate the balancing act between your office and interfering in local politics.  However, our duly elected school board has pursued a private vendetta since taking office which has culminated in the termination (on a contract technicality and against the advice of their own attorney) of our very well respected superintendent.  This school board has sought to quell all dissent, intimidated teachers and put the schools at risk to loose their accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CASI).  SACS CASI has sent a letter to the board and given them 30 days to respond to the numerous complaints lodged against them.
A member of this board has sent racist e-mails, admitted he has and continues to serve as the chairman has not had him resign.  Please have your office look into these matters and help our outraged community.  Ann and Burt Moncrief

We desperately need your help.  We have a chair of the local school board who just voted to end our superintendent's contact - which is a breach of that said contract since it is a year earlier than what the contract states.  Now that same chair of the board has asked for a list of all teachers that are in support of our superintendent (their boss) and if any teacher is on any list of support for him their job is in jeopardy.

This is in complete violation of our first amendment rights!  The chair of the board has a GED and home schooled her own children and now she is threatening the teachers if they voice their opinion!

SOMEONE has to stop this woman from her ILLEGAL ACTIONS!!!!!!!  In addition to this story...
_________________________________

We need of your help.  We have have an enormous scandal that is going on with the Burke County School Board.  They have not only dismissed our superintendent without just cause, but now a member of the school board has been caught circulating racist emails.    The children of Burke County are suffering at the expensive of 5 people on a board of education with personal vendettas and racial slurs circulating in the community.  The other board members refuse to dismiss Robert Hairfield for the racist emails; they say he did it as a joke.   Please tell me how any form of racism is a joke especially among students in a public school.  There are 14,000 students in our school system, they are very internet savvy as well as have the ability to read print of what this man has sent around concerning race.  He has used the "N" word and referred to the Chinese race as "Wetbacks" which is a complete disgrace.  Last Sunday - Burke County ’s upstanding citizens, the Rev. W. Flemon McIntosh broke the news about the racist emails then copies were given to the public through the popular youtube online site.  Rev. W. Flemon McIntosh has the original emails and is willing to speak with you directly; his phone number is 828-437-2491.   Not only has Robert Hairfield sent out the racist emails, he made the comment “to shoot to kill” at a board meeting referring to those opposing the early termination of David Burleson’s contract which is dated through April 10, 2010.  
The entire issue is deplorable concerning our superintendent but now that racism has been brought into this, what is it doing to our children?  It is teaching them that it is perfectly okay to be in an elected position and be a racist because the other board members refuse to force him to step down.  This community as well as society has come so far in settling racial boundaries and showing our children that color has nothing to do with a person’s heart and character and then we get slapped in the face with these racial slurs.  I can provide you if you would like, copies of the original emails, but you will be able to view them now on the youtube link I have enclosed.  Three different news stations have tried to get a statement from Robert Hairfield and he slams the door in their faces. 
Please, I beg you to step in with some direction...The Governor says she can do nothing, the State Board of Education says it is out of their hands, the County Commissioners are standing by idly and assuming that this behavior "is just a joke"  It is not a joke to the 14,000 children that attend Burke County Public Schools. 
Regardless of the fact that the superintendent has been with the schools for 27 years and his contract was breached and ended 1 year before he retires - illegally as the contract states a 2010 end date and the school board refuses to honor it.  Regardless of the fact that thousands have came out in support of David Burleson our superintendent and refuse to allow this to happen to him.  Regardless of these facts - Racism should never and can never be tolerated!
No one else is helping to remedy this - will you?
We are not going to stop with this story - no matter how long it takes, no matter how many people we have to contact.  Please help!
Thanks so much! - Links are Below!

Jacumin is too busy with other things & our representatives are taking the easy way out by saying they cannot interfere. We need help in getting this board out completely. I helped put these people in office & I would like to help take them out. I did not know that they were after Mr. David Burleson our Superintendent. He is a fine Godly man & loves our children & grandchildren. I have known David most of my life & he is a highly skilled educator whom our children love & want to keep. We need help................. PLEASE.

      Dr. June St. Clair Atkinson, North Carolina State Superintendent
      Representative Hugh Blackwell
      Representative Mitch Gillespie
      Senator Jim Jacumin

Dear Sirs & Madams:

Most of the letters you most likely will receive on this subject are from concerned parents with children in the Burke County Public School System.  My perspective on the matter is not that of a concerned parent of a student, but that of a concerned voter worried about the future of our county. 

In 1995, I moved from Robeson County, my place of birth, to Burke County with my family.  I came from an eighth grade class of about sixty (60) students at Faigrove Middle, into a class of about five hundred (500) at Freedom High School.  In addition to having to make the adjustment to the physical environment, the standards of learning were also much higher in Burke County than those of Robeson County.  It took very little effort for me to excel in my studies as a student in Robeson County.  It was simply not challenging enough in the time that I was there.  When I arrived as a Freshman to Freedom High School, where David Burleson served as principal, not only did I not know anyone there, but I had to work twice as hard to maintain the grades I had become accustomed to achieving.  I welcomed the challenge, but I would argue that this change was overwhelming facilitated by the discipline, pride and confidence exuded by Mr. Burleson through his leadership as principal at Freedom.

In my four years at Freedom, I achieved Academic Excellence, excelled in sports and, ultimately, received an academic scholarship to Lees-McRae College, where I graduated in 2003 with a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice.  This scenario would not be possible for a Burke County student if certain members of the Board of Education are allowed to continue on with their antics. 

Taking accreditation away from the schools is not the answer to clean up the current situation in Burke County.  Doing so will only punish the students.  The students have done nothing to deserve this and cannot speak for themselves.  Therefore, it is up to us as the voters in this county to do what our elected board members will not and protect the futures of the students. 

I ask of each of you, to look deeply into this situation and take into consideration the voices of your constituents.  Break the vicious cycle of the rogue members of this board.  Punish the members who created this and the many other problems in the past:  Tracy Norman, Tim Buff, Karen Sain and Rob Hairfield.  Their decisions are the reason our school's accreditation has come into question and are a result of their personal agendas/vendettas and are not in any way in line with the views and opinions of the people of Burke County.  We, as a County, have attempted to voice our opinions to the named officials and have had our First Amendment rights taken away from us on those occasions.

The people of Burke County can and will clean up this mess, but not until November, 2009.  However, action is needed now.  You can intervene and help save the future of our students.  You will not regret intervening.  You will, however, live with regret should you choose not to intervene.  The futures of over 14,000 students are in your hands.  As elected officials, I would advise you not ignore the more than 90,000 voices of Burke County, NC.  Our voices will make a difference in November and we ALL plan to pick and choose carefully during that joyous time.  The voters deserve to have people in positions such as yours and on the Board of Education who will listen and act with honor and dignity.

I'm not begging you and I'm not even asking you.  It is not my place to do either.  I own my vote, no one bought it.  So, I, as do the other voters of Burke County and the State of North Carolina, own a share in what any elected official says or does and I am simply stating what I expect of those I employ in office. 

Sincerely,
Billie Jo Edmondson

Gov. Perdue:

The fine people of Burke need you.  They need you to be their champion of education and our leader.  No doubt you have heard that the Board of Education, after over 2,000 showed up to a BOE meeting last night to voice concerns,and after 80 people spoke 3 board members chose to ignore the wishes of their constituents. Not one person spoke in favor of the vote they approved.  SACS is now involved and has sent a warning letter. Our county could face loosing accreditation due to the dysfunction of the board. How will our children get scholarships or into college? How will we entice businesses to locate in Burke? Why do we fire teachers and hire lawyers to protect these unscrupulous board members.  We need desperately to remove Tracy Norman, Tim Buff, Karen Sain and the racist, Rob Harrifield.

This group has single handedly terminated a valid contract for our superintendant, misuesd funds, worked to ban books, violated our first ammendment rights at the last meeting and the list goes on.

When a situation like this arose in Georgia, The Governor took a firm stand and removed the board members.  They are misusing taxpayers money, and worst of all, gambling with our children's future.

Please, Please, I implore you to act and act now.  You have the power, the right and the people of Burke county standing behind you. Right this wrong and help us.

Governor Perdue,

I don't know enough about the law to recommend what action you could or should take to alleviate the terrible situation in which Burke County Schools find themselves, thanks to this board.  I do, however, know that something needs to be done before three of our four high schools lose accreditation.  Think of the students hoping to go to college.  Think of the people that will look past Burke County when deciding where to locate their families.  Think of the businesses that will do likewise when considering their employees.

This group of four individuals disregarded the will of some 2,000 citizens at last nights board meeting.  They have terminated a binding contract of one of Morganton most beloved citizens without giving the public, or Mr. Burleson the reason(s) for such action.  They have allegedly threatened teachers and staff.  Teachers are looking to leave Burke County so they won't have to deal with this inept, spiteful, unconcerned, malfeasant board.

Please help us to end this nightmare.

Respectfully,

Guy Evans

Dear Governor,
I am writing to urge you to do whatever you can to resolve the situation here in Burke County regarding the termination of our School Superintendent, David Burleson.  Burke County needs him more than ever with the current economic situation NC faces.  I was at the School Board meeting last night and citizens filled the Auditorium, the Cafeteria and the Gym in support of Mr. Burleson.  I witnessed ZERO support for the 4 Board Members remaining that are responsible for his removal, for breaching Civil Rights and for putting Burke County schools in a position where we are facing losing Accreditation...ZERO.  How can it be that 4 people can make decisions so against the entire Community and get away with it?   There must be something that can be done and quickly.  As mentioned before, we need his expertise more than ever.  I'm sure you are also aware of how personally devastating this must be to a man who has given so many years of impeccable service.  They have terminated him just months before he is eligible for retirement. 
Please help us to make things right here, to keep our Accreditation and to have the people's will done.
Sincerely,
Tracy Moss

Dear Governor Perdue, Dr. Harrison, and Ms. Atkinson,

You have no doubt heard from many of my constituents concerning the conduct of the majority of our Board of Education here in Burke County.  Last night, we held a meeting of the BOE, heard 80 people speak AGAINST the Board's actions concerning David Burleson's contract and their general conduct in front of 2400 PEOPLE!  They still turned a deaf ear to the cries of this county.

Not only that, but they voted to spend precious tax dollars on a Special Counsel to assess their legal dillemas against the Superintendent, the ACLU, the NAACP, the SACS-CASI, and God-knows who else.

Our county is suffering needlessly from the foolishness of Tim Buff, Tracy Norman, Rob Hairfield, and Karen Sain.  You all say this is a local issue, and you're right.  You say you are powerless to step in.  Maybe so.  But the State has taken away any opportunity to allow Burke's 89,000 citizens to clean up the mistake of the 5000 citizens who voted for this bunch.  Our county cannot sit through more-of-the-same -  thumbing their noses at the wishes of the people.  Yes.  Come November, because of the resignation of ONE of the five trouble-makers, this county WILL take back the majority of the board by electing decent people.  But in the meantime, our beloved Superintendent will be gone, students worried about the possibility of having to attend an unaccredited high school will be gone, and many of our teachers (due to budget cuts, attrition, and fear of board retaliation) will be gone.

Is that what you want?  We now have a 16.3% unemployment rate here in Burke.  What industry or company is going to bring their business to a place with unaccredited high schools?

At last night's meeting, all 2400 people were very orderly.  We had over 20 law enforcement people there to keep order, including our Sheriff and Public Safety Chief.  Given the gravity of the situation and the escalating impatience and anger of the citizenry, I am concerned that the order and the peace will become more difficult to maintain at each successive meeting.  As I am also a member of the Burke County BOE, I made the motion to rescind the April 20th vote on Mr. Burleson's contract and to extend that contract to June 30, 2010.  The motion died on a 3 - 3 tie.  I wanted to give them one more chance to right the wrongs this bunch have imposed on Burke County's school system, its students, and its economy.  They chose to stand firm and end David's employment on June 30, 2009.  They chose to jeopardize our accreditation.  They chose to continue to ruin Burke County's good-schools reputation.

I have served on the Burke County Board of Education for almost twelve years now.  Governor, I represent YOU, on the regional Teaching Fellows interview committee each year.  I'm proud of you, and, of course, I voted for you.  But please don't do me any favors.  Do what you can for our county, our schools, and our kids. Please.

You're all probably tired of hearing about the injustice here in Burke County, but you will continue to hear about it as long as we must endure this vendetta against our Superintendent, our citizens, and now against our students by these political thugs.  I cannot be more candid than that.

Dear Governor Purdue,

My name is Linda Croom.  I have lived in Burke County for almost 30 years.  I am currently the Linville I Democratic precinct chairman.  I worked hard on your campaign and was thrilled when you won.

As I am sure you know we have a very serious situation happening in our school system. Actions of our school board have resulted in the termination of our superintendent's contract. Such actions have been without stated just cause and are most probably illegal. Our school system has been notified by SACS CASI that our high schools may lose accreditation due to school board members actions as follows: Mr. Rob Hairfield has admitted to sending racist emails and is recorded saying  "shoot to kill" at a November meeting when students were trying to express their opinions; Ms. Tracey Norman for suggesting tracing emails to learn whether teachers helped to organize student protest; the restriction of First Amendments rights of the citizens of Burke County. Personnel records are missing from the county office. The ACLU of NC  has issued a letter stating that the board has indeed violated First Amendment rights and agrees that the situation in our county is a travesty.  The NAACP is involved.  Our legislators are refusing to be involved saying that this is a local issue. There are two lawsuits pending against this school board.

Governor Perdue I am asking that you become involved in this situation. Please have your staff review a similar case in the Clayton County Public Schools in Georgia. In 2008 this school system lost its accreditation  over similar circumstances. Then Governor Sonny Perdue removed from office the Clayton school board members who refused to resign. I believe this school system has not regained its accreditation. If Burke County loses its accreditation, our students futures will be in jeopardy. A parent in our community has already been contacted by her child's college of choice saying that they do not accept students from unaccredited high schools regardless of grades of SATs.

Governor Perdue over the next few weeks you will receive petitions calling your attention to this situation.
Please take this seriously.  We currently have a great school system which is being destroyed by our school board.

Sincerely,
Linda Croom

Dear Governor Perdue,



Please look into the Morganton, Burke County, NC Board of Education.

from what I see, we need help. Over 2,000 people showed up at a

Board of education meeting last night in support of keeping David Burleson

as our superintendent. From what I understand,he was voted out by three board members who do

not like him…over 2,000 people do. Please help us keep Mr. Burleson. Please look at his record.



Thank you,



Rhea E. Cooper

I am writing as a concerned parent in Burke County.  The issues with our current Board of Education are out of hand and needs immediate attention from someone with more authority.  This issue is much more than a local issue.  It is to the point that my 7 year old and 11 year old are now being affected. 



* Teachers and staff are being threatened by our board members.  It was a total shame that so many Teachers had to send letters to the meeting last night where over 80 people spoke during the open forum.  They had to send letter due to possible retaliation from the board chair.


* There was over 2250 people in attendance with people from the community and students speaking to the board. 


* The Board chair would not make eye contact with people as they were making comments and one of the speakers pointed this out and asked who was listening and only 2 people responded.  The board chair was too busy watching the lady who was keeping up with the 3 minute time to focus on the speakers. 


* One of the speakers was a student with special needs who was doing his very best and she called him out after 3 minutes and someone was kind enough to give up their time.  I am truly concerned with where Burke County is going. 


* This board also voted to obtaining special council.  I am a State employee and I know what shape our economy is currently in.  Burke County is also in a pinch with funds as well and we can not afford to hire special council when my children can not get a book assigned to them in school because they have to share books.


* Our high schools are close to loosing accreditation.  This would also be a disaster for our county and for the student who have dreams and desires to attend college. 


* Teachers are going to be driven out of our county and who would want to Burke County to teach? 


* This board has expressed too many personal issues as it relates to the superintendents contract - not performance based.  


I along with several others in this county would love to sit down with someone and discuss these issues and their effects on our children and explore the options that we have as citizens.  



I plead with you to PLEASE aid us with this critical situation.  I understand that Governor Perdu has a passion for education and I would love to have the opportunity to discuss my concerns with her or any representative from the state that could aid us in this situation.  I along with others would be willing to drive to Raleigh if someone would just talk to us and help our children.    



I would also be willing to obtain a copy of a video from the meeting held May 4 to let someone see how the board and the chair responded and reacted during the meeting.  



PLEASE – insure that the governor gets this information to save our children from this madness. 



I sincerely appreciate your time and attention in this matter,
