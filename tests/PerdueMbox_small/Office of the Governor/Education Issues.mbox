Dear Governor Purdue,

I have the privilege of being witness to your first months in office as the first woman governor of this great state of North Carolina. Your tenacity and compassion for your citizens inspires me during this time of our fiscal challenge. I have fallen victim to a bureaucratic anomaly rife with inconsistency and unfairness. Your audience and attention to this issue I am requesting and I will deeply value your input.


I entered the North Carolina Department of Education as a music teacher in Durham, North Carolina in the fall of 2004. Because my degrees are in music performance(Bachelor/ Masters) I was issued a Lateral Entry-Provisional License. I attended all of the Beginning Teacher activities as mandated by the school system and I submitted and successfully completed the observation cycle. In August of 2005, I relocated to Fairfax County where I served successfully, as a music teacher for three years.. I desired to relocate to be closer to my parents and initiated that pursuit in the spring of last year.


I contacted Department of Pupil Instruction (DPI) in May of 2008 and inquired if I would be allowed to teach. A DPI representative informed me that yes, I had two more years on my Provisional/ Lateral Entry license. During these remaining two years, I would be able to fulfill the education requirements that I lack. (As my Bachelors and Masters are in Performance) I simply needed to seek vacant positions, interview, and the interested counties would then contact DPI. I interviewed in the counties of Mecklenburg, Orange, and Guilford. I was offered a contract in Orange County and Guilford County expressed great interest in me as a candidate, but had a concern with DPI. I was told to contact DPI which I did immediately. I was surprised to discover that DPI had switched polices regarding how the 3 years of my license was interpreted. They decided that the three years of a license were to be consecutive. I was told that I would not be eligible to employment as a teacher until August of 2010 or until I was able to take the appropriate classes. This news created great fear turmoil for me, as I am a single mother of two boys, nine and twelve. Plans had been made to relocate to North Carolina based on the May conversation I had with DPI. I was forced to move in with my mother who in September was diagnosed with stage four cancers. The circumstances merited that I cash out my retirement to meet my financial demands. Finally, I became employed as a Teacher’s Assistant in Wake County. Yes, I was thankful to find work, but I realized that I would be unable to take the coursework that would allow me to teach due to the salary that I would receive. In December I was contacted by DPI with what I thought to be good news. As I was told, DPI realized that there shift in how the three years contract years of the Provisional License had created a financial hardship. I was not the only individual in this predicament. If
I could prove that I was offered a job based upon the initial interpretation of “three years” I could indeed work. I state that yes, I had been issued a job offer and that I had that contract in my possession. Unfortunately, a month later I was told that I would only be able to teach in the position for which I received an offer. I replied” ...how absurd...that the position was not open…the position was not held for me…DPI was offering a faux olive branch…” to which that I was correct…and that yes, it was unfair.

Governor Purdue, it is my hope that you can help me. I want to teach and I am outstanding at what I do. I remain anxious to take the required coursework and I look forward to how it will increase my effectiveness as a music teacher. I want to provide a better standard of living for my two sons and myself. DPI has been unfair to me and I assume that I am not the only person that has experienced this treatment. Whatever you are moved to do or choose to do, I will appreciate and will respect.

With every good wish, I remain…

9 Rocking Chair Lane

Leicester, NC 28748





Please do not repeal the 2009 tuition grant for the seniors at The North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) for they can not go back and change their decisions.



I am a proud parent of a senior at NCSSM. My daughter (Alle’) has been taught to work hard, always do her best no matter how hard it is and one day she will be able to help others with what she has learned. With this in mind she decided to attend NCSSM where she could get the best education she could get and also help pay her way through college.

Alle’ has done very well at NCSSM and has been accepted to UNC coming this fall.

She loves the chance to attend UNC she comes from a family with very little formal education and UNC is a great university but in addition to this fact Alle’ also was excited because of the tuition grant; with this she knew we would be able to afford for her to attend without it putting a large amount of stress on us. With her goals of becoming a Doctor one day she has to do what she can to help keep the school expense down while also getting the best education she can. This tuition grant means a great deal to her and her ability to accomplish her goal without so much debt means the world to us.



The seniors have applied, accepted and made life changing decisions based on this tuition grant. These decisions can not be changed it is too late. They have turned down acceptances at universities, they have turned down scholarships, they have left their old high schools were they would have been the top student; they have applied themselves harder than students should have to; to accomplish their goals. The choices they have made will help create a better future for all citizens. To take away the help that the tuition grant provides now when the bright students can not change their choices would be a shame. Do not let this happen to North Carolinas future. Please see that at least the seniors will still have the tuition grant for they can not go back and change their decisions and they should not have to.



Thank you for your time. Please contact me at 828-683-3086 if you have any questions or concerns.





Sincerely,



Rebecca Fuller

Subject: Tuition Grant

Dear Governor Perdue:

I am greatly alarmed to hear that the Appropriations Act of 2009 includes a proposal to eliminate tuition grants for graduates of the  North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics who attend UNC universities. 

My son is a senior at NCSSM due to graduate in two months.  I am upset at this proposal for the following reasons:

1.  With graduation two months away and our commitment deposit already made to NC State University, our options at this time are gone.  All scholarship and application deadlines have long since passed.  We were counting on the the State of North Carolina to keep its word to provide this tuition grant to defray expenses to attend NC State where he plans to study microbiology and later medical research.

2.  While attending NCSSM is a unique and exceptional experience, students there give up a lot to attend.  I'm sure they are all grateful for this opportunity, as are we, but had these students remained at their local schools, they would no doubtedly be in the top 5% of their classes with many scholarship offers as a result.  They gave up these opportunities as well as the opportunity to earn income for college tuition since they are not allowed to work while attending NCSSM.  They did this willingly in order to get a top notch education.  They believed that working extremely hard would have rewards, one of them being the tuition grant.

3.  NCSSM classes are much more rigorous than in other public high schools.  Students there do not have perfect 4.0 GPA's and work extremely hard to get A's and B's and sometimes even C's.  I believe that these students have gone above and beyond and and made many sacrifices.  

4.  Had we known that the tuition grant was in jeopardy, my son could have applied to other universities closer to home which might have been more affordable for us.  With two months left until graduation, we no longer have this option. 

4.  Many perceive all of the students at NCSSM as kids from wealthy families.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  There is a great cross-section of students at the school including those from rural counties of  North Carolina and many minorities.  They all have two things in common - motivation and intelligence.  Many of these students would not have had the opportunity to get the caliber of education in their home school that they are receiving at NCSSM.  In addition, funding four years of college would be difficult without careful planning.  Leading them to believe that their college tuition would be covered and then snatching it away at this late date will be devastating.

I understand that we are all going through tough times, but surely breaking a promise to some of the brightest students in our state is not the way to go.  If you must rescind the tuition grant program, please begin with next year's junior class members who can choose to attend NCSSM fully aware that the tuition grant is no longer available.   Pulling the rug out from under this year's senior class at the 11th hour cannot possibly be what our legislators have in mind.

For these reasons, I beg  you to reconsider this proposal.  These students represent the future of our great state.

Subject: 2009 Appropriations Act

Dear Governor Purdue,

I am writing to you today to express my deep concern over section 9.7(a) of the Appropriation Act of 2009, which was sponsored by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly & Swindell. Section 9.7(a) deals specifically with the repeal of the Full Tuition Grant to students who graduate from the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.   This repeal would be effective at the end of this school year and would directly impact the current juniors and seniors at NCSSM as well as future students. 
While I am aware that you have received a communication (dated March 31, 2009) from Dr. Gerald Boarman, Chancellor of NCSSM, I felt it critical to write myself, as one of your constituents, to let you know how strongly I oppose the elimination of this tuition grant to NCSSM students and to urge you to stop this repeal and continue the tuition grant.

As you are aware, graduates of NCSSM, one of the most prestigious schools in North Carolina, and indeed the U.S. and the world, and a model for many similar schools around the world, receive a tuition grant to any campus of the North Carolina University system.  This is very important and has proven that with this tuition grant, these students, some of the best and brightest in North Carolina, remain in North Carolina for their higher education.  As I am sure you are also aware, there is a direct correlation between where a student completes his/her higher education and where he/she ultimately resides, works and pays taxes as an adult.    North Carolina needs to keep these students in North Carolina.  The success of the tuition grant program since it was established, shows that it works. The number of graduates of NCSSM who remain in-state has risen from approximately 55% to approximately 80%. 

While I recognize the current financial crisis we all face, both personally and as citizens of North Carolina, North Carolina has always been at the forefront, been a leader, in education and appropriate education initiatives.  We cannot allow this to change.  The NCSSM Tuition Grant needs to be restored.  Some of the reasons to restore this grant are as follows:

1.  Based on the promise of this academic award, most of the current senior students and their families made decisions to attend UNC institutions prior to the release this budget proposal. In many cases, they declined scholarships elsewhere. For these families, especially, it is too late to make alternate plans and avoid serious financial harm.  Without this tuition grant, which was already promised to them by the State of North Carolina, some of these students may not be able to complete their higher education as originally planned.
2. Both junior and senior families have made important educational and financial decisions based upon this compact, the tuition grant which was promised by the State of NC when they made the decision to apply to and attend NCSSM.  This has also served as an incentive for academic achievement since the students' middle school years.  This incentive extends beyond the current student body but is also well known among current middle school and high school students, thus giving them another reason to work and study hard and seek to attend NCSSM and then, once enrolled, to successfully complete their studies at NCSSM.

3.  As mentioned above, the tuition grant is symbolic of the importance placed by North Carolinians on educational excellence and needs to continue to keep North Carolina at the forefront of education for our citizens.

Please do everything possible to restore this tuition grant for NCSSM and its students. 

Thank you for your attention.  Should you have any questions or wish further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Governor Perdue,
As an educator with 25 years in NC, I am apalled at the fact that, Number 1, you would rob schools and students of the EDUCATION LOTTERY money which the schools are entitled to, but Number 2, you would consider robbing teachers who have hung in there through the hard times with students through the years by taking their longevity pay for two years. My gosh, we have leaky roofs in our schools, do you have that in your government building?  Do you have enough paper to make copies of important things?  WE DON'T. For six years, we went without a single penny of a pay increase, and only those of us who have worked the longest for the schools have experienced that, but you want to test our ability to hang on yet again by looking greedily at our longevity pay.  I AM SO SORRY THAT I VOTED FOR YOU. You have disappointed parents, teachers, and students in this state by cruelly using bait and switch tactics on us. We are vulnerable to attacks from the media, parents, and budget writers, but we thought we could count on you. You disappoint me. Your staff has not suffered from any cuts, pay cuts or staff cuts. Why don't you show yourself to be an example for those across the state that you are crippling?  And where are our funds from Washington? Why can't we use them to do the basic maintenance required in our crumbling schools? WE NEED HELP and we were counting on you. What happened?

Sincerely,
Debra Reynolds

Subject: NCSSM Tuition Grant Repeal for 2009 & 2010 Graduates



Dear Governor Perdue:

The repeal of full tuition grant for The North Carolina School of Science & Math, that is outlined in section 9.7(a) of the Appropriation Act of 2009 that is being sponsored by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly and Swindell for the graduating class of 2009 and 2010 is unfair and unjust.  The class of 2009 have already made their college decision based on this pledge/promise of a tuition grant by the State of North Carolina.  The class of 2010 accepted admission to NCSSM based on this pledge/promise of a tuition grant by the state of North Carolina. NCSSM's graduating class of 2009 and 20010 tuition grant should be grandfathered.

It is crucial that members of both 2009 and 2010 graduating class receive the tuition grant that they were pledged when they began their studies at NCSSM as a junior.  My student left his home town with the promise by the great state of North Carolina that he would be receiving a tuition grant from any of the 16 UNC state universities if he was accepted, and he had full faith in that promise by the State of North Carolina.  This tuition grant is a very important award for academic merit for these students.

As a result of attending NCSSM, my son has not been able to find any part time work, due to the fact he is only home one weekend out of every month.  Please note that every NCSSM student is required to perform work service at the school, from answering the switchboard, to working in the kitchen, and in addition, every NCSSM student also performs over 65 hours of community service,  which is a requirement for graduation.  Workservice, community service, and all college-level courses are required of NCSSM students.  All community service hours must be performed within a North Carolina state organization, or North Carolina charity.

What does it take to get accepted into NCSSM?  You need to take numerous tests and obtain numerous teacher recommendation letters.  The classes my son attends at NCSSM are all college level and above.  My son received a  "800" in math and an "780" in verbal and writing on his SAT test, and has chosen to stay in NC at a UNC university for his college experience based on the promise of a tuition grant. He applied "early action", was accepted and made his commitment.  I am sure you are well aware of the commitment each NCSSM student makes to the state of North Carolina, and to NCSSM.  Please note that all congressional districts are represented in the student population at NCSSM.

How can we build a better North Carolina, if all our best and brightest go to another state for high education?  Please keep full faith to the tuition grant promised to the graduation class of 2009 and 2010.  Before tuition was granted, only abut 55% of graduating students remained in NC, now over 80% of graduating students stay in North Carolina for higher education based on the tuition grant. 

Please do not repeal the tuition grant for this years' graduating class (2009) and 2010, have the tuition grant grandfathered for these student, and please take into consideration all that is required of NCSSM students (work service, community service, college-level classes, living away from home) when re-writing any laws pertaining to the tuition grant for future classes.

Thank you.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Like many other environmental educators in our state, I too am shocked at your recommendation to dismantle North Carolina’s Office of Environmental Education.  Obviously, early in your tenure, you realized some of the problems that formal educators in our state face by reorganizing your Education advisors.  

I am a tenured professor of Education at UNCG.  I have served on the faculty at UNCG for nearly seventeen years. I came to UNCG and taught environmental education before we had an environmental education certification program in North Carolina. I have advocated tirelessly for the incorporation of this certification program into our state education certification program, as have many others, but to no avail. My students want this desperately. But, rather than moving forward toward that goal, you propose to move us backwards by dismantling the very office that has worked to achieve this end. I would suggest that instead of eliminating the Office of Environmental Education that you take some of your necessary budget cuts from the Department of Public Instruction (DPI).  The savings would be immense, not paltry.

If we destroy our environment, and we are making good progress in that direction, then we will not need education. As Henry David Thoreau said, “What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?”

DPI is an excellent example of a place where you could make the kind of budget cut that you propose for the Office of Environmental Education and minimally affect services. Additionally, you risk alienating fewer teachers, professors and informal educators who believe that the most important education we can offer at this time is environmental education.

I just read in our University newspaper, Campus Weekly, that you will be giving the commencement address at UNCG on May 15, 2009. I hope that you will seriously reconsider your suggestion to eliminate the Office of Environmental Education.  I think that you will get a much more enthusiastic reception in May from our many students and faculty if you take a strong stand to support this vital component of becoming a learned person.  

Sincerely.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please keep the tuition grants available to the NCSSM Class of 2009 & 2010. The students , especially the 2009 Seniors , who are graduating on June 6, 2009.

Most of these students have already obligated themselves to attend one of the 16 NC Universities, partly because of the grants. Many have turned down schools in other states with scholarships.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and support!

Sincerely,

Terrie Stackhouse

April 3, 2009

Gov. Bev Perdue,

Regarding the Appropriation Act of 2009, I am dismayed to hear that the NC State Legislature is considering repealing the tuition grant that has been promised to the current students (class of 2009 and 2010) of The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. 

NCSSM is an exemplary school that has filled a void in the public school system for almost 30 years.  Many of the students that attend have exhausted all of the math courses at their home schools by tenth grade.  These are precocious students with bright futures ahead of them.  They would have been one of the top students at their home high schools and qualified for several scholarships.  Instead, they chose the road of leaving their family and friends behind to pursue excellence in education.   The challenge at NCSSM is great even for the brightest students and they work very hard late into the night five or six nights per week to complete the homework load.

My son is a student at NCSSM.  It was very difficult to watch my fifteen year old go off to a school that is two and a half hours from home.   In his junior year at NCSSM he is taking all first and second year college courses in math and science.  He was one of a few at our home high school … he is one of many at NCSSM.  His opportunities to earn an academic scholarship were greatly reduced when he chose to attend NCSSM.  It was very difficult for my son to leave his friends, his home high school, and his family.  He told me that the tuition grant was his main reason for choosing NCSSM.

I understand the budget crisis our state and many states across the country are facing right now.  This is a difficult time in our country’s history.  Please do not loose site of what made this country so great.  It was original thinking and entrepreneurship.  The students at NCSSM are the key to North Carolina’s future.  Before the tuition grant was offered only 55% of NCSSM graduates remained in state for college, with the grant in place, 80% choose to stay in state.  Let’s work to keep these kids here in North Carolina for college so they will want to build their life here after college and bring new opportunities to grow North Carolina’s economy.

Academic scholarships are becoming very rare.  High school students who work so far above and beyond their piers should be rewarded for their academic excellence.  Please do whatever you can to retain the tuition grant for the NCSSM classes of 2009 and 2010.

Thank you,

Joan Finn

Subject: Teacher needs help.



My name is Leigh Anne Shore.  I am a teacher and have some concerns about how teachers are sometimes treated in the field of education.



To give you some background, I am 31 years old and have been teaching for 8 years.  I went to UNC-CH and graduated with 2 majors and the equivalent of a minor.  (BA K-6 Elementary Education, BA English, and Minor in ESL.)  As a result I have 2 teaching licenses K-6 Elementary Ed and K-12 ESL.  I have always wanted to be a teacher.  When I moved from regular Ed to ESL, I decided that I needed more Spanish-Speaking skills, so I attended a prestigious language school in Middlebury, Vermont, where I became relatively proficient in conversational Spanish.  Then I applied for a scholarship to study abroad for 3 months to further my Spanish-speaking skills.  I did this of my own volition and paid for it out of my own pocket.  Finally, in 2007, I got my National Board Certification at an ESL specialist.  I am only telling you all of this, so that you know I am dedicated to the profession as well as my students, and I have worked very hard to be the very best teacher I can be. 



Here are my issues:



1) The state paid for my National Board Certification.  I was pregnant while I worked on it, and had an infant when I took the test.  That was my choice.  The plan all along was that I would work part time once our baby boy was born, and then go back to teaching full time as he reached school age.  I was unaware until I was well into the process that I had to teach FULL TIME in order to not refund the state the $2500 fee.  I knew that I had to teach in NC the year following my certification, and I planned for that, but it wasn't until I was 6 months pregnant and nearly through the process that a friend told me that I would have to work FULL TIME.  Although the website, may have been changed by now, it was not even mentioned there.  I read all of the criteria BEFORE I signed on for the process.



Now, I am being asked to refund the state $2500 dollars.  I appealed in a letter, but received what I believe to be a form letter in return denying my request.  (It did not address any of the points in my appeal.)  I am currently teaching ESL, as a specialist, part time, and I did so last year,so I AM using what I learned from the National Board Process in NC.  Isn't that the whole point of the rule about teaching in NC the year following the process?  I plan to continue to teach in NC in the coming years.  However, I have to say that I am now disheartened.



Would you please consider taking a look at this case.  I have taught for 2 years part time following the NBC process which is equivalent to 1 year teaching.  At the very least, could you please use what power you have to reduce the cost and require me to pay only 1/2 of the fee back since I am working 1/2 time?  Although I do not feel that I should have to repay the $2500 fee, these two options seem more fair and legitimate to me.



2) I have become disheartened by this whole situation.  You see, I have taught ESL for 6 years now.  (I taught regular ed before.)  During those 6 years I did not work with another ESL teacher who was licensed in that area until this year.  They came in lateral entry or with another teaching degree and did far less work to get their ESL license than I did, if they got it at all.  They also were sometimes paid more than me, based on years of experience in education or years with the state.  These things have always seemed unfair to me.  I often feel punished for going to school to become a teacher instead of coming in to teaching from a different profession. 



I have done the best I can to be the best teacher I can be.  PLEASE consider taking a look at this case for me.  Call me if you have any questions (336.945.4295), or respond to this email. 



Thank you for your time.

Subject: NCSSM Tuition Grant




Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a resident in Johnston County, NC.  I am concerned about that the state legislature is mulling over taking away the tuition grant for students attending North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). 

My Daughter Michelle is a senior at the NCSSM.  She went to NCSSM not only for the great educational opportunity but also for the tuition grant for her to attend NC state colleges.  We were under the impression that the tuition grant is secured for her college education and we could count on that.  She got accepted to UNC Chapel Hill a few weeks ago and we are very excited about that.  Michelle also agreed to attend UNC Chapel Hill because there is not better chance to get a great value and high quality education at the same time. 

My wife and my self discouraged my daughter from applying out of state colleges when she started her college application process because this great financial incentive and the high quality education that North Carolina is offering.  In addition, she did not apply any other scholarship because we feel that tuition grant will give us adequate financial assistance.  Now, the legislature plans to change the rule of the game at the last minutes.  We are puzzled and confused.  And it is too late to start her college application all over again.   

I believe NCSSM is one of the best education programs that North Carolina offers.  It gives student the opportunity to challenge themselves and be the best they can be.  I also believe that keep these highly achieved students in NC college system will have positive effect in NC college performance.  We all know that good education system will entice corporate investment and help recruiting employees.  I further believe that keeping these highly motivated students in North Carolina will help transforming our state from a traditional labor intensive manufacturing state to a technology focused state.  Only that, we can have no fear of recession and can say good bye to high un-employment rate.   

I hope our legislature will maintain the commitment and keep the tuition grant in the budget. 

Thanks.

<http://blog.heritage.org/2009/04/03/federal-report-dc-school-voucher-program-improves-reading-scores/>Reading Scores

·                                  Posted April 3rd, 2009 at 3.05pm in <http://blog.heritage.org/category/education/>Education.  Heritage Foundation

The U.S. Department of Education’s released a report today presenting the finding of an academic evaluation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. It found that, after three years, students who were offered vouchers to go to private school through the program had made statistically significant gains in reading achievement.

Specifically, the IES report found that “those offered a scholarship were performing at statistically higher levels in reading—equivalent to 3.1 months of additional learning.” Like previous evaluations, it also found that “the [Opportunity Scholarship Program] had a positive impact overall on parents’ reports of school satisfaction and safety…”

The report is accessible <http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20094050/pdf/20094050.pdf>here.

As regular readers of The Foundry will recall, <http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/11/morning-bell-the-same-chance-obama-had/>Congress inserted language in the recently-enacted Omnibus bill that placed the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program on tract to end after the next school year unless Congress (and the D.C. City Council) authorizes the program.

Key members of Congress, including California Senator Diane Feinstein, have said that the results of this academic evaluation should determine whether Congress renews the program.

In the wake of this report, Members of Congress and the Obama administration must now answer a simple question: do they really want to terminate a $14 million program that is improving the reading achievement of low-income, minority children in the nation’s capital?

Instead of ending this program, Congress and the administration should now be looking to expand it <http://www.heritage.org/research/education/upload/bg_2137.pdf>to let many more D.C. children have the opportunity to attend a safe and effective school of their parents’ choice.

NC Schools CEO, "Disrupting Class" author consider 
school innovation's next phase with NCNSP leaders
North Carolina needs to accelerate secondary school innovation, using new technological tools in the work to shape schools capable of graduating all students ready for college, careers and life.

That was the overarching message from members of North Carolina New Schools Project's Board of Directors, Board of Advisors and supporters of school innovation from the private sector, government, education and philanthropy this week. They gathered Thursday afternoon and Friday in a meeting that featured dialogue with State Board of Education Chairman and CEO Bill Harrison and Michael Horn, co-author of the widely-read Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns.

Reflecting on his own experience as superintendent in Cumberland County creating two successful innovative high schools, Harrison said there's a need for higher expectations for graduates and schools that can help them reach those benchmarks. Those schools must exist as far more than pockets of innovation.

"There are things going on in these new schools that comprehensive high schools can learn from," Harrison said.

"We need to be more emphatic about goals that are aimed at making sure all students are successful," Harrison said. "Too many people are satisfied with the status quo. There are too many people who aren't committed to equity. They're not committed to the same things for all children that they want for their own."

"It's not acceptable to let a student drop out of school," he said. "That's a moral imperative and an economic imperative."

The power of technology to offer alternatives creates another imperative for schools, Harrison said. Public education could become the equivalent of the public health system -- the service sought only by those with no other choice. That would be a loss for the nation, he said.

Horn touched on that notion of educational choices made possible by technology. He noted that one way technology is influencing public education is to be the kind of "disruptive innovation" that he and his co-authors have studied extensively in the private sector.  Online learning has the chance to address a fundamental flaw in traditional brick-and-mortar schools -- an inability to fully address the differences in how students learn best given the need for standardization in the delivery model.

That competition can spur improvement in the old model. "Online learning is gaining ground," Horn said, noting that he and others predict that such instruction will account for half of all high school courses by 2019. "We can use this opportunity to transform the system to make it more student centered."

Christopher Dede, Wirth Professor of Learning Technologies at Harvard, predicted that the greatest lift would come from "blended" courses that take the best attributes of face-to-face learning and the benefits of online learning. 

Experts and NCNSP leaders stressed that the introduction of technology alone is not innovation; technology is a tool that can speed changes in teaching and learning and steer it in new directions altogether.
Glen Kleiman, executive director of the Friday Institute  for Educational Innovation, said he and colleagues at  North Carolina State University have begun referring to the "learning ecology" of schools to capture the scope and depth of change to the roles of teachers and students technology can bring.
"This is not just a little change," Kleiman said. "This is changing the whole ecology."

Experts from outside the state predicted that North Carolina will lead in school innovation that leverages technology given the foundation present in efforts such as NCNSP and school connectivity.

Dede said that too often, transformative schools that yield especially strong results can't be easily replicated because they depend on the "heroism" of individual educators. He's encouraged by the innovation underway in North Carolina because it's not such a "hot house" model, and therefore holds the promise of being scalable.

"It's a slower progression. But it's a progression that leads somewhere," Dede said. In addition, he said the a key strength of the state's efforts to transform high schools lies in a diversity of models instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach. "Having different models under the same umbrella allows them to borrow good ideas from one another," he said. "There's evolution through diversity. I think that's really smart."

Dede suggested that high school innovation in North Carolina is a "disruptive" influence itself by raising the stakes on all schools. "Does that put pressure on other schools and communities?"

Horn called North Carolina an "exciting model" for high school innovation.

Leaders at the Chapel Hill meeting saw technology at work in Rutherford, SandHoke and Wayne early college high schools -- all part of the state's 1:1 Learning Technology Initiative, Southern School of Engineering and the New Tech school model being replicated in nine North Carolina sites. They also saw state and national examples of technology deployed across networks of schools to raise teacher and principal knowledge and skills. The leaders offered suggestions for how NCNSP can leverage technology, which the Board of Directors and Board of Advisors will take up later.

NCNSP President Tony Habit noted that "Innovation 1.0" in North Carolina began with purposeful design of schools that acknowledged the need for all graduates to be ready to pursue a two- or four-year degree. He projected that "Innovation 2.0" will tie innovative schools even more closely to the state's economic future and will use technology to its fullest.

Graduation project off for class of 2010, State Board says

The state's new graduation project will be delayed a year to allow schools more time to implement the new requirement.

The class of 2010 was to have been the first in the state subject to the new graduation hurdle. That distinction now falls to the class of 2011 after the State Board of Education voted Thursday in favor of the one-year delay.

Board Chairman Bill Harrison recommended the postponement to give schools time to put the plan in place. Legislators have been considering dropping the requirement entirely. Although the board added the requirement four years ago, while the class of 2010 was still in middle school, schools, parents and students began to clamor in recent months for its elimination.

Harrison's proposal keeps alive an idea that for many years has been viewed as a valuable approach to engage students with an in-depth research project that would serve as an "authentic" assessment of student skills in such critical areas as communication and research.

The approach has been gaining ground in North Carolina and across the nation as an effective way to assess what students have learned and are able to do -- without having to rely solely on paper-and-pencil tests.

A number of schools in the state began requiring a senior research project -- either as a graduation requirement or as part of senior English -- before the board added the requirement statewide.

Sharper focus on global benchmarks sought 

The United States is missing a key opportunity to improve its schools by failing to take full advantage of international benchmarks, according to a recent policy brief from the Alliance for Excellent Education, a Washington-based group that promotes high school transformation.

The brief -- <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102534472197&s=336&e=001FHW1Lx_rwrp6Lsx3r9i5uan8vUP343Dbsv4ChIXrBpJTlh50Aa7RWCezF32Orqcwo8VPBwsdFr4ObZSDv--Xjnf0TzSH8HEmfFMYvIiHDZE=> Short Sighted:  How America's Lack of Attention to International Education Studies Impedes Improvement -- urges the Obama administration and Congress to take steps to learn more from other leading nations in economic development and education.

While the United States does participate in the two key international benchmarked assessments -- Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) -- the Alliance for Excellent Education argues in its brief that the U.S. doesn't pay enough attention to the results.

Other nations that are making gains are using the assessments to drive improvements, the brief says, pointing specifically to efforts in Germany. There, unexpectedly low performance on the 2000 PISA was enough of a shock that the country sought expert help through OECD, which administers the assessment, from several countries, including Canada, England, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.

The brief says the nation can ill afford to remain uninterested in the experience and lessons of other often higher performing nations. The Alliance cites recent rankings on the international assessments to make its case: U.S. 15-year-old students were 25th of 30 industrialized nations in mathematics literacy, 21st of 30 in scientific literacy and 24th of 29 in problem solving.

Even as the United States supports the development and administration of the assessments, the Alliance notes, the nation is receiving only a limited return on its investment.

"From a big-picture perspective, however, some might say that the United States is underwriting opportunities for other nations to learn how to improve their education systems," the brief says, "while forgoing these opportunities itself."

The Alliance outlines a number of recommendations aimed at making better use of the data, engaging individual states for specific samples and doing more to learn from other countries. Among them:
* Review current policies and participation in international comparisons
* U.S. Department of Education should commit to meaningful participation in benchmarking opportunties. (Current support is limited largely to gathering data on educational outcomes and less so on policies and practices used to improve outcomes.)
* Funding for full participation in international benchmarking studies
* Encourage the participation of individual states

Common thread for top scoring nations: Teaching quality

One key difference between the United State and other nations with higher performance on international assessments such as TIMMS and PISA is their focus on teacher preparation, the Christian Science Monitor showed in a series of recent articles.

The newspaper examined how teachers in <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102534472197&s=336&e=001FHW1Lx_rwrpd0RjuUZvzSiY4YdD2_Bwufxtwg7Afa5sybJnF_FF0ymQ55ArO3WrRkrTNNmzh2GvioOQmcMnrGUZqVfXHVPgK0AKYcg7-4bBcYQRUhSV_GTmRXgZZaKMgk7Ri17gC4h_K_zbo_PhjEPJMk6S00suQ> Finland and <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102534472197&s=336&e=001FHW1Lx_rwrrRLiS0S4fp1jPfYMKishBMD_FnGeqWqCN0y0isSEy8hgOjYZMVTQhrQHsBewfNI1YkTDl7GzvL15n21BiBpo_c1C7XUNewjEi-pwc-Q6AE1mquj9V03uKYM3lzeuWpTa70xn0jYw9DnV0WoGki-E5N> Singapore are trained and supported in a search for clues to why students there often outperform their peers around the globe.

In both cases, the stories reported, teaching programs are highly selective, teachers are highly trained and once in the schools teachers are treated as professionals -- with clear paths to career advancement, strong autonomy or both.

"Teachers in Finland and a number of other high-performing countries are more involved than American teachers with creating curriculum and measuring whether students are really learning it. And this in turn develops teachers' own understanding and effectiveness," the newspaper wrote, paraphrasing Stanford education professor Linda Darling-Hammond, who has researched teaching internationally.

In Singapore, "not only is teaching an honored profession," the paper reported, "it's also paid as well as science and engineering careers."

The newspaper cited a recent paper by Darling-Hammond that identified <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102534472197&s=336&e=001FHW1Lx_rwroHN9_pRlh6I03BAj5wAMULaRgThMmuPE3JrObWHjPyOCo29uperRyQGhVP0jq9SsYgZPdJcz4f16d4KTUxTHMDZxIA5QtgxRqKd_7gdvZVHpuZhpXtkFiPq5Z9CTFpQlGQdArtOmuuPraNMyEJ3foD> four key areas where nations with strong student performance tend to have an edge over the United States:
* Support for new teachers -- In New Zealand, new teachers spend 20 percent of their time being coached.
* Teaching versus planning time -- In most European and Asian countries, teachers spend 15 to 20 hours a week outside the classroom for planning and meetings with colleagues, parents and students
* Participation in decisions -- Teachers elsewhere are involved in writing curriculum, designing tests and solving problems
* Lifelong learning -- In Singap0re, Sweden and the Netherlands, teachers receive a minimum of 100 hours a year in professional development

Governor Purdue,

I voted for you and was very confident about my vote, until the Principal of the school where I am employed, showed us the power point of the State cuts in education. I was appalled! These cuts will greatly impact the children's education!

Then, when we received our paychecks March 31st, there were teachers who received from hundreds to thousands of dollars more on their check as a bonus for performance award, plus longevity pay. If you took all that money, and the ABC bonus money away, maybe there could be jobs spared that will be diminished after this budget cut. I felt as though this performance award and longevity pay was an analogy of the CEO's that received a bonus with bail-out money. I was upset over this as you can tell. Thanks for listening. I just think education should come first in a matter as important as this........afterall, these children are our future leaders. Why cut them short?



Sincerely,

Lyn Flowers

Dear Governor Perdue:-)



I know you are a busy lady with so much on your plate to think about and admire soooo much what you stand for in all you represent.  I want to say please hang in there for our education systems at all levels.  I am a certified teacher representing <mailto:More@4>More@4 Pre-K and EC children within our community of Catawba County.  I am so thankful that so many of our at risk children have our schools to turn to (even more so now that we are in an economic crisis....we will be needed more than ever not only to provide that needed educational framework for our young children, but to provide that stable, safe and loving environment children are going to need in dealing with the stress of our world today).  I am so thankful we are here today and see sooo much what our programs do for children before entering kindergarten in an inclusive classroom building a community of friends ready to succeed.  I am so blessed to do what I do each and everyday.  



PLEASE hang in there for our early childhood world and most specifically our <mailto:More@4>More@4 Pre-K's and EC directions for our children.  I know cuts are needed, but hopefully our cuts are not to dissolve programs that are proven to be doing major good in all directions.  I know our federal recovery funds are there to help struggling families (this is going to be worse) and we still need our program funded to run accordingly so we can be ready for these families that are going to be in even more need with our economic crisis.  I truly think our schools and programs from early childhood (early/critical/crucial years) up are going to be needed more than ever.   I just hope we keep our quality of programs and teachers there for our children and families.  Our educations and schools are needed more than ever.



Thank you for all you do and the walk you make each day in standing up for what is needed in our state and country (esp. education).  We are thinking about you.  Please contact me if you have further questions...I love this world:-



Happiness,



Stephanie Aldridge

Governor Perdue,

I am extremely disappointed with the Senate budget and urge you to fight for protecting early childhood education programs.

I am for moving More at Four into the Division of Child development, but not at the great cost proposed by the senate.  It will be impossible to maintain the quality of More at Four programs (or the new proposed “Plus Program”) at the offered rates.  If we really want quality programming in 5 star centers, then eliminate More at Four totally and spread the monies across quality initiatives.  Quality starts at birth, not at four!

The Smart Start cut is too large and does not follow the goal of protecting all levels of education, including the early years.

The federal recovery funds were meant to help out struggling families during this current economic crisis and not to supplant existing programs.

Sincerely,

I am an Early Childcare Education professional and feel that early education in children is absolutely mandatory for the continued success of our children in public schools. Families are already struggling with paying the high cost of childcare with the many state requirements placed on childcare providers and the cost continue to sore. Please, Please help the hard working families provide a safe educational place for their children as they try and work to make a living!  If families are forced to have no other alternative then they will be leaving their children at home, unsafe and uneducated.  People will do what they have to for survival. Please don’t let our children suffer the consequents of poor management of funds. Smart Start and More at Four programs have provided so much to children, their families, hard working staff and companies in the Early Education industry.  Make cuts in any area of your budget except EDUCATION! These children are our countries future!!!!!! Not even one should go without the opportunity for a safe place to be and a good education. I work with Childcare Network and we deal mostly with minority, very low income families. We provide many wonderful services at a very competitive price. Our company even offers full time tuition for all age groups that are on subsidy waiting list tuition for only $100 per week! Not to mention most of our schools are at least a 4 STAR rated school. WE are doing our part to help the families of our communities. Will you please so all you can to help these same families.





Thanks and have a great day! :)

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for your commitment to young children. You inherited quite a mess, and you have some very difficult decisions ahead. Your budget proposal showed good judgement and moderation in many ways, especially in minimizing the cuts to Smart Start. Unfortunately, the Senate budget version at this point has doubled that cut, to 8%, and that would mean major reductions in services to young children and probable restructuring for Smart Start and providers like us. It would be devastating.

It is also very concerning that More At Four may be gutted and put under DHHS/DSS. The proposal to move it under Smart Start made much more sense.

It is critically important that we maximize the Pre-K services to our young children and their families. Numerous studies have demonstrated that investments in early intervention with our young children is the most effective use of the available funds; it is much better and cost-efficient to get a child developed well and positioned to get a good start in school and in life, as opposed to reacting and rehabilitating that child once he or she has developed serious problems and is in school. 

Today, our Pre-K services are one of the few areas where North Carolina can rightfully claim a positon of leadership - and this is something we need to hold on to if we are to have a positive future. Maximize the funding to DCD, NCPC, and Smart Start. We are counting on you, Governor; we trust you to do what you know in your heart is the right thing.   

Best wishes and God bless you,

Dear Governor Purdue

Please fight on behalf of NC's at-risk four year olds!  The More at Four program is one of only 2 high-quality preK programs in the country - how sad to read of the cuts in a national e-newsletter!

The children served in this program start school ready and strong - the single best cure for drop-out and retention stats!

The existing subsidy system is so overwhelmed and unconnected to quality that it cannot be counted on to serve these children!

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.

The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.

“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”

The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.

“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”

<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.

In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.


Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.


Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.

“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”


Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.

An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.

“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”

House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.

The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.

The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.


On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  

“My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. 


Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/> Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).

“My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”

As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 

Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."

Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 


Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.

“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”

Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.

Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety’s Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Subject: Governor's School Cuts



Dear Ms. Perdue,

I attended Governor's School in 2006, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. It was to my great dismay when I learned that your budget would drastically cut back this year. I realize that we are in hard economic times right now, and sacrifices must be made somewhere. However, I implore you not to sacrifice this wonderful program. I realize that the proposed cuts would not eliminate the program entirely, but would cut the number of students the program serves in half, reducing it from 800 students to only 400 students. This would probably lead to the reduction of the program to only one campus, and to a reduction in the budget of the remainin campus as well, reducing the resources and services  that the programs can offer the few students still given the opportunity to attend.

Governor's School fundamentally shaped my academic life and changed how I thought about things. It exposed to me ideas and concepts I otherwise would never have gotten a chance to learn about.  I learned so much in those too-short six weeks, not only from my instructors, who were all brilliant, but also from my fellow students. I studied the social sciences there, learning about political science, anthropology, and sociology, but I also learned to engage in constructive discussions with people who had views different than my own, exploring issues to their depths while appreciating and respecting each others' viewpoint. I was amazed at the insight of my classmates. At my high school, most of the students do not care about current issues. But here, everyone was aware of current events, and everyone had opinions on them, usually strong ones. I was excited to be intellectually challenged, to be able to participate in discussions where everyone’s point had logic behind it, where students took the debate seriously. Governor's School allowed me to become more comfortable with my beliefs as part of who I am, and it allowed to to gain confidence both inside the classroom and out.

An investment in Governor's School is an investment in the future. The program is designed to give North Carolina's best and brightest student's, allowing them to explore their academic interests in an intellectually stimulating and creative way in an environment that encourages this exploration motivated purely by their love of learning. The program challenges these students and allows them to grow by surrounding them with their peers, students equally as engaged in learning as they are. The program prepares these students for the future, giving them the skills and education needed to meet the great challenges our country is currently facing.  The program teaches students to think critically and analytically and question ideas instead of blindly accpeting them .

North Carolina Governor's School provides an extremely valuable exprience for the students who are fortunate enough to attend. Please don't make that fortunate number any smaller. Invest in Governor's School so that the program can continue to enrich student's lives and challenge them so that they can become the leaders we need to face the challenges of today and of the future.

Respectfully,

Marjorie Lee Mayfield

How can I voice concerns about education and the direction the Charlotte Meck system is going. We are loosing our support staff in elementary schools at an alarming rate. Dr. Gorman has  removed school psychologists and parent advocates  from the elementary schools, both important support staff positions, especially in our high poverty schools.
Thank you for making education a priority. My 4 children are out of school, now, but my grandchildren will heading for school in the not to far future. We have worked for many years through PTA, and numerous committees for the school board to improve our schools. The community as a whole benefits from a strong school system.

“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety’s Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp. For more information on No Need 2 Speed, go to the Governor's Highway Safety Program Web site at <http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/>http://www.ncdot.org/programs/GHSP/.

Dear Governor,



It would be a huge disservice to our community and state if The Wright School closes down.  This is the only school of its kind in this state to help the kids with special needs learn to live in the community and home settings.  If it wasnt for this school my son would be in an institution paid for by the state rather than learning and striving and making a huge turn around.  The Wright School has been around for more than 46 years, it also serves as a training facility for UNC and NCCU.  The staff at the wright school has more collective experience put together than any mental facitlity around.  Can we really afford to lose this school.  Each generation of kids are facing more and more mental challenges with all that is going on in this world, the wright school is the only place available to help with those challenges and help our kids transition back into the home settings without long term hospitalizations.  This facility cost a mere $58,000 per child for a 6month stay, had they been in an institution it would be $1,000 a day, please tell me where this state would be saving.  Not to mention the institution is less effective than the wright school so the chances of readmission are very strong.  Our kids are very safe at Wright School with highly trained staff, at instiutions there is constant fear of abuse and neglect, and kids aren't getting the training and teachings they need to survive in the world. If this school closes you are basically saying our  kids don't matter.  I thought with this new stimulus package from the President that education for special needs was going to benefit, yet here we are getting shut down.  Please relook at this program and see in the long run how much it has actually saved the state and helped in the educational system when our kids kept getting kicked out of public schools.  Had it not been for this school my son would not be striving and succeeding in life.  Please save the Wright School.



Your  Truly,



Melissa Christopher

Subject: Pre-K Now lette re: More at Four
Importance: High



Dear Governor Perdue:

For many years, North Carolina’s esteemed early education system has been a source of pride for the state and a priceless benefit for its children and families. In fact, the More at Four program earned praise just this week by the National Institute for Early Education (NIEER) as a national model for high-quality early education.



Unfortunately, this valuable program - currently one of only two in the nation to meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by NIEER – now faces a grim possibility. The Senate's budget proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, could  ultimately decimate the program entirely. This would be devastating for children, for working families and for the state’s economic health in the future.



The Senate’s budget proposal threatens a cut of $40 million in state funding for More at Four and changes the purpose of the program entirely by moving the program out of the Department of Public Instruction and shifting its focus from pre-kindergarten education to welfare support.



If the Senate proposal passes, More at Four would no longer be considered a pre-k program by the National Institute for Early Education Research and North Carolina would, in effect, offer no state-funded pre-k to its families. Under this bill, children could be forced to leave the program in the middle of a school year because their eligibility would be contingent upon their parents keeping their jobs, enrolling in school, or maintaining their income below a certain level throughout the year.



Having heard you describe your support for high-quality pre-k in your State of the State address, we urge you to step in and oppose the Senate’s budget proposal, which would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at Four. Especially during this economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human capital – starting with its youngest citizens.



Your leadership on this critical issue is needed to ensure that North Carolina’s children do not lose the opportunity to attend high-quality pre-k. The nation will be watching.



Pre-K Now, a campaign of the Pew Center on the States, collaborates with advocates and policymakers to lead a movement toward high-quality, voluntary pre-kindergarten for all three and four year olds. We look forward to serving as a resource as you work to protect and improve North Carolina’s nationally renowned early education system. Please feel free to contact me or have your staff contact me at dgonzales@preknow.org or 202-862-9861 should you have any questions or wish to discuss this issue further.

Sincerely,

To the Honorable Governor Beverly Perdue:

Please don't cut the budget for the Office of Environmental Education.  You spoke at the ceremony when I recieved my Environmental Education Certification from DENR about how important the environmental issues of this state are to you. As an environmental science teacher I have participated in and used the plethora of information, games, videos, and activities that I have gathered from workshops in my classroom.  What students don't learn to love they won't take care of.  It is important to North Carolina's future that we educate our population about the issues that we are facing: High ozone emissions in the Triad; beach erosion on the coast; water pollution in the Neuse River; smuggling of turtles; introduced species; reduction in wildlife habitat; forest death; acid rain..........need I go on.  It is essential that we protect our water, air, and resources in a sustainable fashion so that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy what makes North Carolina a beautiful state to live in.  I have attached a letter that I wrote to the Office of Environmental Education after participating in their teacher conference last summer.  Thank you,

Debra James

Governor Perdue takes Additional Steps to Manage State's Cash Flow

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday instructed the Office of State Budget Management  to take steps to manage the state’s cash flow in order to meet its financial obligations.



Effective immediately, the Governor enacted additional limitations on spending throughout state government, including freezing the purchase of goods and services, ceasing all travel not approved for public safety, public health and economic development reasons, and leaving unfilled personnel positions vacant. Exceptions may be made for direct classroom instruction expenses and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety



“North Carolina continues to face budgeting challenges. My decision to limit agency spending is crucial to North Carolina’s ability to meet our financial obligations and to provide essential services for our citizens,” said Gov. Perdue.



Additionally, Gov. Perdue identified 18 areas from which some $145 million in funds will be transferred to maintain cash flow in the General Fund.  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=289>For the list, click here.



Scotland County Adds Natural-Products Manufacturer, 98 Jobs

Nature’s Earth Products Inc., the nation’s largest supplier of natural cat litter and manufacturer of hardwood-blend fuel pellets, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Laurinburg.  The company plans to invest more than $12 million and create 98 jobs during the next three years in Scotland County.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $196,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



“North Carolina’s forward-looking policies continue to attract companies specializing in emerging green-industry markets,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce, top-rated business climate and extraordinary quality of life offer the perfect environment for businesses like this one to locate and expand here.”



The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.  Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.  All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.



Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.  Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, Scotland County, City of Laurinburg and the N.C. Rural Center.



Jackson County Manufacturer to Add 61 Jobs

Stonewall Packaging LLC, a joint project of <http://www.jacksonpaper-nc.com>Jackson Paper Manufacturing Co., is building a new plant in Sylva to produce recycled cardboard packaging.  The company plans to invest more than $16 million to renovate and modify a vacant mill, creating 61 jobs in Jackson County.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $200,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



“As global markets evolve, North Carolina’s manufacturing sector is keeping pace to take advantage of new opportunities,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Companies like this one are investing in green-friendly products while continuing to enjoy our state’s top-rated business climate, skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”



The 61 new jobs will pay an average of $39,344, not including benefits, which is more than the Jackson County average annual wage of $27,820.  The company will begin hiring this summer.



Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, the Department of Revenue, Department of Transportation, N.C. Community Colleges, Southwestern Community College, Jackson County, the Town of Sylva, the N.C. Rural Center and Duke Energy.



Growing a Green Economy

Speaking at a Charlotte energy summit on Monday, Gov. Perdue reiterated her view that North Carolina is poised to lead the nation’s green economy.  As she said in her speech: “The state that gets green right will own the next 50 years – and North Carolina must be that state.”

Dear Madame Governor,

I am confident the cuts required by the current budget shortfall in North Carolina are difficult.  The loss of jobs and funding for programs will affect lives in the short and long term.  I ask you to reconsider the cuts to state university tuition for students at our School of Science and Math in Durham.

The students at this school are of the caliber that are able to enter top universities in this country, frequently on scholarship.  The class of 2009, including my stepson, have not applied for admission to universities other than the UNC system; nor have they applied for scholarships.  This is because they accepted in good faith their tuition would be paid upon graduation from the school of Science and Math, as per the state’s agreement and promise. 

While this certainly puts the senior class at financial risk and peril, I ask that you also continue tuition funding for the current junior class, as they have invested their time, efforts, and sacrifice based on the promise from the State of North Carolina. 

I believe you will do the right thing and uphold the promise made by the state.

Sincerely,



Andy Dunlap

Subject: Schools

Comment: My County School System is having to come up with $3.6 million dollars in cuts to help you balance the budget. I am fearful that important programs will be cut and Teachers will loose their jobs. This will do nothing but drive up the unemployment rate even farther than the current 12.9% my county has. I know of $12 million that you can re-coup right now in NOT purchasing the land at Grandfather Mountain right now. The timing is way off. What do you propose that the Schools get rid of to help you balance the budget?

Subject: Education cuts

Comment: Governor Perdue I am a retired teacher in Montgomery County, a tax payer, community member, parent and in-law of two classroom teachers, and grandmother of a child who will enter the Public school system in 3 years. I am currently working as a Reading First Interventionist at Candor Elementary School and have maintained close ties with staff and students here. Two retired ("Double-Dippers") classroom teachers were informed this past Friday that they would not be asked back next year. I fully understand this decision made by our local administration-cuts must be made, and this was a logical choice. I know you support the maintenance of quality teachers in the classroom as opposed to "fat" at the administration level. My concern is that our local administrators will continue to pad the County Office with staff and cut no one on their level. Unfortunately I do not have much faith in our local school board, though I do plan to speak with our Chairman about my concerns. I have never contacted an elected official before, but I just needed our tiny insignificant voices heard. The classroom teachers are indignant but feel the threat of repercussions if they speak out-they need their jobs. They work hard everyday, get little for their sacrifice and feel powerless to fight. Thank you for your time. Help us. Laura M. Harris

Subject: teacher pay, including longevity pay

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am wanting to know exactly why are teachers having to take such a big hit with the budget this coming year. I thought you were a governor that backed education, especially k-12 education. I am not looking forward to my pay check taking such a big hit with health insurance premiums and the loss of longevity pay. Could you please let me know why k-12 educators, some of the losest paid state employees, being hit so hard for next years budget?

Content-Type: text/plain;

X-Folder: Education Issues

good afternoon governor Bev Perdue

after reading the latest on state health plan benefit changes for 
2009-2010 i am shocked on the increase in premiums, deductibles, 
co-payments, etc.

What is going to happen - the average family is not going to be able to 
afford needed health insurance and end up dropping it - then they/their 
spouse/children will be without health insurance and most doctors do not 
give these people the care that is needed. (i know for a fact someone i 
know went to the doctor, the doctor told them they needed diagnostic 
tests, etc. everything was fine until this person informed the doctor 
they did not have any health insurance - the doctor then changed their 
focus and said well maybe you can do without the test) actually the test 
was imperative however since the person did not have insurance the 
doctor was not going to order it (the person said I will pay for it out 
of pocket) however there are people that can't pay out-of-pocket so they 
would have been denied a possible life-threatening diagnostic test 
because they had NO insurance because they cannot afford it.

i thought the State as well as President Obama said he was going to make 
it where every child had insurance however the state is making it where 
parents cannot afford it.

when i first was hired for the state, benefits were an incentive for 
people to work for the state, now it has become a burden - why not 
consider some other method of reducing health insurance instead of 
raising it - i know companies that have BCBS however the employee only 
has to pay $75 month for their benefits, deductibles are much lower, 
co-payments are lower etc. - one reason is they offer a health 
assessment program for the people that do not smoke, etc. - why can't 
the state offer that to state employees - reduce their premiums, 
deductibles, co-payments that don't smoke, obese, etc. instead of 
reducing ones that do smoke, obese, etc. to a 70/30 plan

OR

send out on bid for other insurance companies to offer better 
coverage/lower premiums, lower deductibles, lower co-payments, etc.

OR
get legislature out of it and deal directly with BCBS

This is becoming a crisis if people will not be able to afford health 
insurance - people will die prematurely because they cannot get the 
necessary health care that is needed

It appears the State is not concerned about the average family whether 
they have health coverage or not - if so someone would make it more 
affordable -

FOR EXAMPLE:
just an employee having family health coverage, dental insurance, and 
parking at this university they shell out $800.00 month now - it will be 
more come July 1 when all the health benefits change

With the cost of living increasing (food, rent, gas, etc) and state 
employees not getting a cost of living raise (if so very limited) 
something has to be done about health insurance coverage.

with the way the economy is and everything increasing this health 
insurance has got to be the one affecting most families - WE ALL NEED 
AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE - Let's be reasonable this is NOT 
affordable for the average person

i'm asking you to please try to come up with a better solution.

Thanks for your time and consideration

SINCERELY,

FROM CONCERNED US CITIZENS AND STATE EMPLOYEES

Subject: House Bill 6/Senate Bill 199 - Davie's Law

Comment: To Governor Perdue, I am writing to you to ask that you help support House Bill 6/Senate Bill 199. I am from Minnesota and started working in your state years ago to try and help shelters improve rescue operations. The gas chamber is always on my mind as I have helped groups focus on humane euthanasia and rescue, I have helped shelters completely turn around in your state and their attitudes have changed. Please outlaw the gas chamber as this is prehistoric and so many of us are working to better the shelters and their ideas to improve life for the animals in their communities. When there are people like us, out of state, and in your state, that care, please show that you do. Re-election is important but so is accomplishing something under your leadership that makes the world a better and safer place for all that co-exist together. One last note, I have 2 dogs that were in an extremely high kill shelter that used the gas chamber from North Carolina. They are amazing family companions. Both had relatively serious health issues that I had no problem treating and taking care of and I can't imagine them not in our lives. I have personally spent thousands on the simple treatments to help the animals that have health issues to make them adoptable and I would never question that it wasn't the right thing to do. Please help the animals in your state by banning the gas chamber. There are so many of us who care. Let us know that we have made the correct decisions to help you by making your state a better place in general, especially for the animals. Most Sincerely, Britt Gage
