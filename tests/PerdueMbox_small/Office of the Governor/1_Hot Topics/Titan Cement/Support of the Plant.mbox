Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research an! d I know Carolinas Cement and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Benjamin Schmitt

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research and I know Caroli! nas Cement and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.
