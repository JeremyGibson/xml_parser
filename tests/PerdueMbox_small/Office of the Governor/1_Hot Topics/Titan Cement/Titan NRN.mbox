Subject: Titan cement plant

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My wife and I chose to move to Wilmington to raise our family 3 years ago. Having lived in big cities for many years, we have come to appreciate and love the natural beauty of Cape Fear. I fail to see any upside to the proposed Titan cement plant in Castle Hayne. The tiny number of new jobs it may create seem to be outweighed by the likely harmful effects on the region's wetlands and the health of its people(my two beautiful daughters included). As one who supported you in your bid for the Governor's office, I expect you oversee Titan's efforts to build its plant here with the interests of the people who live in the area in mind. Sincerely, Francis Bradley

Subject: Gov. Easeley Employed by Titan Lobby Firm.

Comment: Governor - I voted for you. I am not terribly political but I was taken aback to learn that frm Gov. Mike Easley is now employed by the lobbying firm representing Titan Cement. This is troubling. It is so important that the population not lose confidence that our government elected officials put interests of people in front of self enrichment. This Titan deal smells very strange and now to learn the Former Governor works for the lead lobby firm for Titan, is really troubling. PLEASE put all these permits on hold and evaluate if any impropriety occrured during the Easley Administration related to Titan. The majority of people who live in Wilmington do not want the cement plant here. Please do not let an inside job prevail. Please. Thanks. Earl Galleher 910.520.5466

Subject: Investigating Titan

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would like to thank you for the call to action to investigate the permit process surrounding Titan Cement. It is a shame that your predecessor has caused so many people to doubt the legitimacy and ethics of many of the acts of NC government. I applaud you for taking the steps to restore the people's faith in the righteousness of government. I hope that you will take this a step further and put a 90 day freeze on any additional permits related to the plant. This investigation needs to be concluded before another permit is issued for this project. Sincerely, Adam Shay

Donald van der Vaart and Governor Beverly Perdue,

No to the proposed Titan cement plant in New Hanover county!

The air and water pollution is not worth the jobs.  They want to burn coal and destroy wetlands.  This sounds like an entrant into Polluters hall of shame.

	I realize  that this only one citizen     but I hope there is also enough  feedback  to show that this plan has too many negative  consequences to be  approved especially  when it comes to the health of people and the environment  there should  be no further consideration  thank you for  listening   Peace     John F Holmes  from North Chase
