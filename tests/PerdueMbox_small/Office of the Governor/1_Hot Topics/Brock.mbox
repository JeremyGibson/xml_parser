Governor Perdue:

I am ataching a Word Doc File with a letter on these two important subjects, and I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with and/or talk to staff on these subjects  I would  also appecitate a written reply ASAP, not the standard email response with no pertinent information.

Thanks.
