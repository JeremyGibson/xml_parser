I am in shock over the governor's continued disregard of citizen civil rights.  She apparently is going to continue to fight the release of the prisoners who have ALREADY COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCES.  She has not said, publicly, her justification for this horror, just that she wouldn't want them living next door to her.  I would have thought our civil rights were safer with a democrat but now I see I was wrong, and that I was merely blinded by my hatred of the Bush regime; democrats can be dictators too.  Mrs. Perdue will never get my vote next time if she doesn't back off this outrage and let the prisoners who have served their sentences finally go home.  It appears that racism will persist into the 21st century if those of us who are not blinded by ignorance and bigotry do not stand up to those in power.

Governor Perdue, YOU CANNOT CHANGE A PRISON SENTENCE BASED ON YOUR OWN PREJUDICES.  What purpose is prison at all if we don't allow people to serve their time and then get on with their lives?  Why don't we just shoot everyone who's convicted of a crime?  This is not a rhetorical question, I would like a response.

Subject: Inmate Release

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I watched your speech concerning the inmate release today and have the need to let you know what I thought of it. First of all, I don't know any of inmates, but I do know that they are human beings. The speech you made only put anger in the hearts of some narrow-minded people and now these inmates have to worry about harm befalling them. These people are not the first hardened criminal inmates to be released from prison. There was a TV report that you have a female inmate working for you. It was said that she committed double homicide. Was this report accurate, and if so, what is the difference in her release and the release of these other inmates? Supervised or non-supervised, if a murderer is a murderer always then how is supervision going to stop someone from murdering again? I just don't see what good it did to put anger and fear in the minds of others unnecessarily. If these people served their time, then it is justice to release them. There are people walking the streets everyday that I fear more than I would any of the people being released. There needs to be some strict laws for all the gangs in this area; that is who we fear.

Subject: Prisoner release

Comment: I have been following the issue of the two prisoners that were due to be released today. It is my understanding that you are against this release. One of the prisoners in particular I feel should be released, and that is Ms. Faye Brown. My argument for her release are: She didn't actually commit the murder, so you have two people in prison and only one of them actually committed the murder. I understand that under the law, if you are with a person during the commission of a felony, you can be charged with the felony, However after serving more than 30 years, and being on work release (note, she still receives prison wages for a job that pays about 10.00 an hour) I feel that she has more than paid her debt to society, and the State. I would urge you to not think of this in a broad sense of political correctness (tough on crime) and take this matter as more of a life issue. Our constitution gives us the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In as much as a CEO of a major company can steal Billions of dollars, and receive a 2 years sentence, even after he has destroyed the lives of thousands of people. This women is in jail because she picked a no good boyfriend. Please release her!

Comment: For the Governor.... while I am not in favor of people who commit murder being released from prison, I am in favor of the law being followed. Everything I have read on this matter, and researched on this matter shows that the current ruling was correct, and the inmates involved should be released. The Governor is letting her personal feelings get the be best of her. The Governor is NOT above the law. I will wait to see what happens on appeal. If the Appeals Court rules the inmates should be released, I expect the Governor to abide by this ruling. Please make sure the Governor gets this message.

Subject: Refusal to Release Prisoners

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I write to ask why you continue to refuse to release prisoners who have served their sentence. The justice system of North Carolina has agreed, repeatedly, with various inmates sentenced to a life term in the Seventies that they have served their full sentence. The wording of the law is quite clear, indeed admirably clear as compared to many of the General Assembly's pronouncements. My hope is that the state government is one that respects the rule of law. You may not agree with the law the General Assembly put into effect during the few years relevant to this issue, but your oath and duty is to uphold those laws. Instead, I hear you giving speeches on the radio asking whether I would like it if one of these inmates moved next door. My answer to you is that I have no idea. I do not know these inmates. I know one fact about each from decades ago: that each was convicted of a heinous crime. I know that they have received credits for their time served, or else they would be in jail for the full 80 year term. I know they have not been convicted of further crimes while in jail, for again, they would not then be subject to release. I believe that the likelihood is that these inmates are either reformed or harmless. I would be proud if I could help them reintegrate as productive citizens and neighbors. I find scare tactics and grandstanding on this issue when the law is so clear to be beneath the office of Governor. If you are worried about the public safety, please spend resources supplementing police forces and re-entry services, rather than fighting frivolous court battles to keep old people who have paid their debt to society behind bars. I am deeply disappointed by your priorities and stances on this matter. Kindest regards, Sam Cone

Electrolux to Create at Least 738 Jobs in Mecklenburg County

Electrolux expects to create a minimum of 738 jobs over the next five years and invest $8.3 million in a new North American headquarters in Charlotte. The announcement was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant and a One North Carolina Fund award.

Electrolux looked across America to choose a location for a North American headquarters and they chose Charlotte, North Carolina, said Gov. Perdue.  Once again this states tremendous workforce and top business climate attracted a globally competitive company.

Electrolux is a global leader in home and professional appliances whose products include refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers and cooking products sold primarily under the Electrolux, Frigidaire and Eureka brands in North America.

The company will consolidate corporate offices from around the country into the new Charlotte headquarters. Electrolux currently employs around 650 people in North Carolina, the majority at a dishwasher manufacturing plant in Kinston.

Risk Management Consultant to Create 430 Jobs in RTP

International risk management consultant IEM will move its headquarters from Baton Rouge, La., to Durham County, creating 430 jobs over the next six years. The announcement was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant and One North Carolina Fund award, and is contingent upon approval of local incentives.

As a technology hub with a vast military presence, the relocation of IEM to North Carolina is a perfect fit that will benefit both the company and the state, Perdue said. This partnership is another step in creating the top-paying, knowledge-based jobs that I am committed to bringing to North Carolina.

IEM is a privately held company that provides risk-based solutions for measuring and managing threats to people, infrastructure and information. Since IEMs founding in 1985, it has provided emergency management, homeland security, military and information technology solutions to federal governmental agencies including the U.S. Department of Defense, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services and as well as working with cities, ports and the private sector.

The 430 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $62,778 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham County annual average of $57,772.

Governor Reestablishes N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday signed Executive Order No. 41 reestablishing the N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service.  The order was signed while Gov. Perdue participated in a home refurbishing volunteer project in Asheville.

> This year, more than any other time in our lives, our neighbors and communities need all of us to reach out with a helping hand, said Perdue.  As governor Ive asked all North Carolinians to make service a way of life.  Were reenergizing this important group and getting more businesses and community members engaged in service.

> The N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service, first established in 1994, is charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive statewide service plan for promoting and recognizing volunteerism in North Carolina.  In addition, the Commission administers four volunteer programs; AmeriCorps, Governors Page Program, Governors Volunteer Service Awards, and Citizen Corps.

> As Governor, Bev Perdue has made volunteerism and community service a priority.  In addition, to todays project in Asheville, Gov. Perdue has participated in a number of volunteer activities including reading to children, planting a garden for the hungry, and serving Meals-on-Wheels.  She has also called on family, staff and all North Carolinians to become more involved in their communities.

> Online Learning Report Shows N.C. Virtual Public School Fifth in the Nation in Enrollments

A new report 2009 Keeping Pace with K-12 Online Learning lists North Carolinas Virtual Public School (NCVPS) the fifth largest virtual school in terms of enrollment.  In just two and a half years, the school has become one of the fastest growing virtual schools in the nation, topping 20,000 in enrollments by the fall of 2009.

> Technology is revolutionizing the way we live and work  and Im committed to using it to revolutionize the way we teach and learn, said Perdue.  Im proud of what we have accomplished here in North Carolina, and Im looking forward to seeing enrollments continue to grow for the NC Virtual Public School.

> North Carolina continues to see rapid growth of over 50 percent per year in virtual school enrollments.  The Fall 2008 and Spring  2009 terms posted more than 15,700 enrollments, while the Summer and Fall 2009 terms saw enrollment surge to the current levels above 20,000.

> The roots of the NCVPS were established in 2002, when the General Assembly created the Business Education Technology Alliance (BETA) and charged it with ensuring that the effective use of technology is built into the North Carolina School System for the purpose of preparing a globally competitive workforce and citizenry for the 21st century.   The BETA Commission, under the leadership of then- Lt. Governor Bev Perdue, established the E-Learning Commission and charged it with establishing the North Carolina Virtual Public School.  The NCVPS offered its first online courses starting in June 2007.   For more information, visit <http://www.ncvps.org>www.ncvps.org.

> North Carolina Number One in National Board Certified Teachers

Gov. Bev Perdue announced that North Carolina once again leads the nation in the total number of teachers who have earned certification by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards with 15,695 teachers now certified. This group of teachers accounts for nearly 19 percent of all the 83,359 National Board Certified teachers in the nation.  North Carolina also ranked first in the nation in the number of newly-certified teachers, as the state is home to 1,509 of the 8,874 educators nationwide who earned the recognition this year.

> National Board Certified teachers are essential to helping transform North Carolina's schools," said Gov. Bev Perdue. Fifteen years ago our state saw its first group of teachers achieve National Board Certification.  We continue to be the nations leader as nearly 16,000 have earned this hallmark distinction. Throughout the years, I have seen first-hand how these outstanding educators have changed the culture of teaching and learning in their classrooms and their schools.   Most importantly, research shows that National Board Certified Teachers can be a valuable learning resource to all students, especially students who need them the most.

> National Board Certification, the highest credential in the teaching profession, requires an extensive series of performance-based assessments including teaching portfolios, student work samples, videotapes and thorough analyses of the candidates' classroom teaching and student learning. Teachers also complete a series of written exercises that probe the depth of their subject-matter knowledge, as well as their understanding of how to teach those subjects to their students.

> National Board Certification was first offered in 1994, when eight North Carolina teachers achieved this professional credential. Since then, the number of teachers in the state receiving the certification has continued to grow. North Carolina has led the nation in the number of National Board Certified teachers for 14 years. The other states in the top three this year are Florida, with 13,281 and South Carolina, with 7,293 certified teachers.

> Governor Calls on Federal Government to Ease Credit for Small Businesses

Gov. Bev Perdue today called on North Carolinas Congressional Delegation to support steps to ease the credit crisis facing North Carolinas small businesses.  Gov. Perdues #1 priority is creating jobs in North Carolina, and helping small businesses grow is critical to creating jobs.

> Small businesses are the backbone of North Carolinas economy, said Perdue.  It is critical that we get credit flowing back to small businesses to work our way out of this economic and financial crisis.

> In a letter to the N.C. Congressional Delegation, Gov. Perdue asked for federal government support for North Carolinas efforts to increase lending to North Carolina small businesses.  Specifically, the federal government should:

>  Identify sources of capital, such as unspent TARP funds, that can be repurposed and deployed through banks specifically for small business lending.

>  Extend the availability of 90% no fee SBA-backed small business loans, and ease the regulatory pressures applied to lenders to bring credit access back within reach of the many viable businesses that need it.

>  Consider tax incentives for small businesses that create jobs as a result of federally-backed loans.

> In 2006, small businesses accounted for 98% of employers and 49% of private-sector employees in North Carolina.

You will never receive another dime of support or ounce of energy from me or anyone else I can possibly influence.   Your inflammatory and patently transparent political pandering on this issue is truly beyond the pale.

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudills ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rands decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

Ms Perdue,

I understand your reasoning, but you are in violation of the rule of law.  You have the right to object and to appeal these rulings, but you have the duty to NOT disparage the courts for their considered judgments.  The courts actually defend the constitution against popular opinion.   The courts try to make sure that rules are properly applied even though popular opinions about those rules may change over time.

You have the duty as a leader in our state to stand up for the rule of law, not tear it down.  As a long-time resident of NC, I'm embarrassed by your behavior.

I certainly hope that your appearing to want to keep folks in prison forever doesn't reflect itself in future plans for building more prisons and incarcerating more people indefinitely.  It's a fools errand if so.

So, you are okay with that judge, but you don't have any use for the other judge and the Court of Appeals? Your pandering on this issue is an embarrassment to the already disgraced office that you hold.

I believe the governor should butt out and let the court system handle it. She is making a political manuever to get votes. The law as it was written at the time should apply to all.

Governor Perdue,
I strongly oppose the state's position on this matter.  The law these folks were convicted under defined life as 80 years. The court in State v. Bowden held that the plain language of the statute means that a life sentence is to be considered 80 years.  
I join many fellow attorneys, both individually and as a member of NCAJ and the NC Bar, in my deep opposition to the State's actions in this matter.  
The law is quite clear and court decision after court decision, judges in this state have interpreted the statute to mean 80 years and that consequentially, these particular inmates should be released.
It is my humble opinion that the people in this state don't need "protection" from these individuals as much as we need assurance that our Governor is going to respect the judiciary and its process.
Respectfully,
Sarah A. Carr

Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

I have been a yellow-dog Democrat all my life but am embarrassed to say that I voted for Beth Perdue. Not since Governor Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama has America had a Governor to utterly disrespect the judicial branch and have so little understanding of our judicial system.  I don't know what my father who was on the NC Supreme Court would think about our Governor--he probably would be ashamed like me.

Dear Governor Purdue,
What you seem to be missing is that whether you like the law or not, it is the law as it is written
and you have to follow that. I would hope that as a govenor of our state you would know this.
Your opinions must be separated from the law and you don't seem to get that.
Do we want judges to rule based on their opinions?
No, that is why we have laws.
Please make sure you remember this and represent our state in the appropriate manner.

Sandy Brown

Dear Madame Governor,
Your comments may be politically useful, but I think you will look back at some of them and be embarrassed to have ever let them pass your lips.
To somehow equate letting people who have spent the majority of their lives in prison living in ways that show that they have learned from their mistakes with just throwing the doors of the prison open for everybody is just stupid.  PLEASE be quiet and walk back from these crazy positions!
from a neighbor and precinct chair in Chapel Hill,
Charles Humble

The Executive has no right to defy laws made by the Legislature.  These people have served their legal sentences, and paid their debt.  Political squeamishness doesn't enter into it.  If the state doesn't abide by the law, how can we expect the people to?

This was/is a weak attempt by Governor Perdue to win the public back over after slapping us in the face with a recent sales tax increase. Just what we needed with the economic tragedy were all facing. What an idiot, first time I recall seeing a NC politician going for a state record of shortest term served. I cant wait to see her out of there and to think I voted for the moron.

What a sad embarrassment our governor has become to people who value the rule of law.  I regret every single thing I ever did to support her.

I would like to express my disagreement with the position you have taken on this issue, Governor.  That our leaders follow the law and protect the rights of unpopular citizens is part of what makes this country great.  Your disingenuous manipulation of the law to score political points is disappointing, to say the least.  I know you have the ability to show political courage.  You did so in signing the Racial Justice Act.  Please don't make a habit of this kind of cheap demagoguery.

Sincerely,

David Weiss

I am really  upset to see that the Governor and the AG have no regard for the LAW.   
Apparently we don't need Judges - we should just let Bev and Roy dictate who gets what.
Truly disappointed.    Voted for  you, still disappointed.

I would encourage the governor to support the rule of law in this case. It really doesn't matter what we think about releasing the inmates the law permits it. We cannot have a governor who believes that she can change the law just because the law was written poorly.

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudills ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rands decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

Dear Gov. Perdue,
I receive your mailings. I voted for you with enthusiasm.

However, I strongly disagree with your stance on the release of these prisoners who have served their time according to our laws. Our state and country are still governed by the rule of law. You may not like the law under which these people were sentenced and under which they served their time, but that was and is the law. For a crass political advantage, you are denying them their rights under the rule of law. That shames our state.

Go ahead and work with the legislature to get the law changed. I can respect that. But I can't respect you actions subverting the law in these cases.

Sincerely,
Steve Schewel

Dear Gov. Perdue,



My husband was a friend of Officer Davis, his wide Irene,  and sons Billy and Tommy. Tom Davis gave his life upholding the law. You apparently do not value the importance of an independent judiciary, a necessary component of our democracy.



If you believe change is needed, work to change the law, not its application. 



My husband and I are longtime Democrats and find your intervention not only inappropriate, but a dangerous breach  of the power of your office. I can only imagine what Tom would have thought.



Sincerely,

Jane Cowan

Governor Purdue:  Give these prisoners release  as the previous decisions of the state allowed for this.  Quickly put on probation and do what is required but give them their earned release.  We are a country that.supports good behavior even if it is in prison!  Thanks

Governor Perdue,
With all due respect to you and your position, I have to say that I disagree with your actions and feel that you have acted inappropriately.  I have supported you in the past but the last few weeks have led me to question your ability to Govern our state, in your impromptu speech on the evening news a couple of weeks ago you sayed the key words " This is personal to me".  We are not concerned with your personal feelings on matters such as these but rater the law should govern and overrule, that is why we have laws and courts. 

Please stop swaying with the wind of the public on all matters concerning the citizens of NC, the wind of the public did not elect you.  Remember the saying "Stand for something or fall for anything".  Thank you.

I wish the Governor would stick to the executive functions of her office and respect the rule of law and the responsibilities of the courts to apply the law without regard to the popularity of their decisions.  It is very disconcerting that the Governor has chosen to "grandstand" over this matter.  It reminds one of George Wallace or Orval Faubus, and the similarity is not flattering.

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudills ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rands decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

I am appalled and disgusted by Judge Caudill's clearly erroneous and apparently politically motivated ruling.

I believe the Governor has over stepped her bounds.  She needs to stay out of the judicial process.
