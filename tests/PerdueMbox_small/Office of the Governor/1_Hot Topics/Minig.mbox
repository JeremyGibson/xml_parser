Governor Perdue

In recent months, radical activists have pressured EPA to stall dozens of mining permits and subject them to an arbitrary "enhanced review" process.  They've pressured the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to consider suspending the use of Nationwide Permit 21.  And they're pressuring the Administration to change the permitting rules without the required public comment period.  They are using these regulatory actions as stall tactics to effectively end surface mining in Appalachia. 

These actions will have far-reaching repercussions across the Appalachian states and the nation.  Thousands of jobs depend on coal, not only in mining, but also in manufacturing, banking, retail and more.  Schools, emergency response teams, libraries and other important community services depend on tax dollars from coal.  And Americans across the country depend on coal for affordable electricity.

In these tough economic times, we need you to do more than say you hear us.  We need you to act.   

As my elected representative, I urge you to do all you can to intervene with the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the White House and demand that they play fair, set the rules and then stick by them.  Please take action today to restore certainty and clarity to the mining permit process.  We need and deserve a stable and balanced economic and energy policy - and it's your job to deliver it.

Sincerely,

When will our representatives in Washington get smart?  Put all of these people out of work and where will they be able to find jobs now that you have sent all the jobs out of Country be way of NAFTA?  Going to Socialism is not the answer.  Making our citizens proud people by earning their way is.  Can't you see that by all of the give away programs producing more and more genreration recipients.   When all are recipients, where do we get the money to give to lthe programs?  Common sense tells us that. Common sense which Washingdton seems devoid of!
