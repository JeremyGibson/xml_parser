Subject: ABC Boards

Comment: I was wondering what the Governor's stance is on how alcohol is sold in the state. I saw something mentioned on the internet that she would like to increase the state's control over ABC. However, I've now heard a rumor that she thinks it should be privatized. Could you tell me which is true? Or if neither is true? Thanks in advance for your time. Melissa

Subject: ABC Stores New Hanover County

Comment: in recent news the ABC Stores in New Hanover County has been making news on the salary of the Manager and his son $400,000.00 between them. When I read how state governments are cutting back on expenses we pay our ABC this large amount of salary. I think this needs to be investigated. I would much rather have teachers, firepersonal and police vs this ABC Manager and son. When I heard they were givin a 7% increase in July I was surprised. They said it was because the sales were up 14% thats really good in an industry were there is no competition because it is state ran. Thank you for letting me vent on this matter

To Our County Commissioners:

The pillage of our tax dollars at the ABC Board has to STOP!

The first thing is that both Williams should be fired/removed. They have failed to do their jobs - to work for the PUBLIC's INTEREST.

Pay rates should be strictly stated and limited. No nepotism - period. No bonuses for doing your job (!)

The argument that they do a better job than average is laughable. The product sells itself with no competition. Prices are set by the State Board as are most policies.

And to say you can't do anything about it except appoint new Board members is not accurate. You can ask explicitly and publicly for resignations!! From the whole Board and the Administrators!!

The voters are watching to see what you do.

I could not agree more.  Immediate action should be taken to replace the board and change the salaries back to a more reasonable level, and if they don't accept it then they should be removed immediately.  Everyone I talked to is appalled and of the same opinion.

Joe -
I agree completely - I was very disappointed / disgusted with the commissioners and boards attitude that they would not allow this IF it had not already escaped their control. The premise that they cannot - undue this calamity is warped. 
Its a bit like saying we have already run over the taxpayers - its too late to put on the brakes - but we will honk the horn - to let them know who is in the drivers seat.
We should all take note of who is in the drivers seat and reward this poor behavior!
We are without serious leadership. We deserve better from our commissioners to control cost and ensure that the precious taxes we pay are utilized effectively in the community. I concur with your appeal and extend the concern to all staff, boards and contractors that profit from our community of tax payers. The Community Water Boards comes to mind.
Can someone point me to the County budget and a listing of the 2009/2010 cost plans for New Hanover County?
We done Joe - this behavior is a cry for help from our commissioners - they are acting like the wayward teenager that need strong adult guidance from the citizen taxpayers.
Lets provide a strong voice to provide that guidance!

To the New Hanover County Commissioners:

As the ABC commissioners continue to "thumb their noses" at both you and the public; acting as though they are untouchable and cannot be removed. I urge you to please review the attached document.

In particular, please note the statement below:

"Qualifications: Appointed on the basis of appointee's interest in public affairs, good judgment, knowledge, ability and good moral character."

I believe that this whole situation with the Williams' compensation and nepotism is clearly a dereliction of their duties. In addition, them failing to tell you of bonus' given because as Mr. Culbreth stated, "you didn't ask" is an embarrassment.

I feel this is more than just cause for them to be removed from office and replaced with members who truly are acting in the best interest of the public.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Nick Carnevale
