Subject: Cut off taxpayer funding of ACORN

Comment: Cornelia W. Bush 473 Melanie Court Chapel Hill, NC 27514-1837 November 14, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask you to cut off all government funding of ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). The taxpayers should not be funding an organization that is under investigation for voter fraud, and is now immersed in scandals involving tax evasion and even child prostitution. Elected officials should do the right thing and vote to cut off all taxpayer dollars for ACORN. Funding this group is a misuse of our money, and I do not think we should be providing any support to an organization that might be a criminal entity. Please respond specifically to my letter with your thoughts on this matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Cornelia W. Bush 9193742428
