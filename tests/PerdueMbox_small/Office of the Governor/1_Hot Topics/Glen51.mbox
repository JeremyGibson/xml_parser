Subject: Beverly, I need housing.....NOW.....please respond......Money is a problem

Comment: Governor Purdue, I have been without water since April as I had a leak under the trailer I live in and could not pay for repairs. The inside is in ruins and the underside is in ruins and I am on disability. I cannot pay rent.....How do I get on Section 8 housing or some other list to where I can get some HEAT? (the heat went out last winter) and I have been paying or accruing light bills of $420 + to cool basically the outside.....I am using electric heaters. Estimated repairs to a 1987 trailer is about $20,000 and I am on disability income of $1100 per month....rental rates are from $450 up.....you know I could not eat or ever wear clothes again. I don't know what to do and don't want to impose on my sister for the $20,000 for a trailer that is worth less than $5000 per tax value....less than that if they only knew what it was like. I am sending this in confidence as I don't want to be cold and I don't have furniture that is fit to move....per se....the furniture was damaged by intruders who broke in 5 years ago....I have no doors I can lock and have a huge hole in my front living room inside and outside..dangerous to maneuver. I am white, barely have a car that runs.....it runs when it wants to....and I don't know where to go nor what to do as I cannot pay the rental rates people want. I found a town home...$900.00 a month....another trailer....$450 rental. I grew up in the country and love pets.....so they are a comfort. I need to know which direction to get a roof over my head and some heat and air that won't cost me my life in doing so. If I have to keep doing what I am doing, then I don't know what to do. I must say that the director of your notary service (I have been a notary for 32 years) gave me the shaft and wanted me to take a test and pay $20.00 for a book and $50.00 for the commission...I could not.....I LET IT DROP. THEY WOULD NOT LET ME TALK TO YOU. I FIND THIS DEPLORABLE. I AM A WHITE MALE, CLEAN, A CHURCH GOER IF I HAVE TRANSPORTATION AND BOTHER NOBODY. AT LEAST, I AM NOT SPREADING MYSELF AROUND AND FATHERING CHILDREN.....SO I DO EXPECT HELP.....I AM 58 YEARS OLD AND THIS IS THE WORST MESS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN. I CARED FOR BOTH PARENTS UNTIL THEY DIED IN 1998 AND 1999 AND LOST EVERYTHING I OWNED, CAR, HOUSE, FURNITURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE...NOBODY HAS A BIT OF MERCY FOR ME.....CAN YOU STEER ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? IF THIS INFORMATION IS DESSIMINATED TO OTHER PEOPLE, I WILL BE OFFENDED AND THERE IS NO NEED TO SEND ANYONE FROM DSS OUT AS I WILL NOT ALLOW THEM INSIDE. THEY HAVE NOT HELPED ME NOR TRIED TO HELP.....NOT EVEN WITH LIGHT BILLS.....SO WHY WOULD I LET THEM IN NOW? THEY DO HELP OTHERS. THEY SHOULD PAY THE MEDICARE PREMIUMS FROM WAY BACK...RETRO ACTIVE......BUT THEY ARE NOT AND WILL NOT. RIGHT NOW, THE SSA IS TAKING $100 A MONTH FROM MY CHECK TO PAY BACK MONEY I EARNED WHILE TRYING TO IMPROVE MY SITUATION.....ADJUDICATION OFFICE HAS THIS IN RALEIGH.....THEY NEED TO LOOSEN MY MONEY AND GO BACK AND PAY THE MEDICARE PREMIUMS WHICH WOULD GET ME OUT OF THIS BIND......FOR GOOD....PLEASE SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.....HAVE AN AID CALL ME....252-522-5191 I WILL TALK WITH THEM BUT WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE IN MY HOME AT THIS TIME......PLEASE DO NOT FORCE A SHOW DOWN.....NEITHER OF US WOULD WIN. I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT THE STATE CAN DO FOR ME AND WHY IT HAS NOT HELPED BEFORE. I DON'T GET FOOD STAMPS OR ANYTHING ELSE......I AM IN THIS WORLD ALONE AND GET NOTHING BUT THE HARD KNOCKS.....I CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER......SINCERELY, WILLIAM GLENN STANLEY.....THIS IS URGENT! I WANT TO FIT INTO SOCIETY ONE MORE TIME AND LIVE LIKE OTHERS.....THAT'S ALL I WANT. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND GOD BLESS......

Governor Purdue, Of all days, when I went to the mail box today, I had an envelope full from 
the office of Disability Adjudication in Raleigh requesting I appear at a hearing on January 
11, 2010.  I have faxed this office on numerous occasions without ever getting a response from 
them and tried to call them immediately as they say there is an envelope enclosed for me to 
return the questionnaires to them........there is no such envelope.  The last time the case was 
reviewed was 2004 which was the LAST TIME the intruders broke in and left me with the $15,5000 -
$20,000 damage which Imelda Pate DISMISSED (the local DA) due to the defendant mailing a biased 
and fraudulent letter to her in June 2006 which was not signed by me.  She arbitrarily 
dismissed all charges against the intruder and has left me with the burden of the financial 
restoration......from the floor up.......at least $5,000 at that time.......and let him go 
habitually free (Jerry Ray Honeycutt) DOB 08-19-1967.  Check his record, his prison records and 
all that go with it.  With this office of adjudication not sending an envelope to return the 
information in (which has not changed, just gotten worse, they are threatening me with stopping 
disability payments and they have been taking $100 for two years while the case was remanded 
back to ALJ as there were procedural problems in the first case.  In short, nothing should have 
been done with my SS disability and they owe me the money back and the Medicare premiums and 
they stopped paying to HUMANA the Medicare D premiums at the end of 2007.  I have to pay those 
now and I was never told they were stopping.  They lie through their teeth locally and 
apparently they don't have their acts together in this office as I would expect a good office 
worker, regardless the title, to enclose an envelope IF THEY SAID THEY WOULD.  I don't have a 
thing to say to them new....I am worse than I was.......I can only say that they are pushing me 
closer to suicide than I have ever been and I have tried it 3 times......to no avail.  This is 
not something I am proud of........but I promised I would never do it again...to my dying 
mother.  I want to see her in Heaven one more time along with my dad.  I see a psychiatrist 
regularly and the depression is still running rampant....it is bad.......I am irate....very 
much so....and as I said in the faxed material, I have no place fit to live....but others that 
live on a ritzy Woodside Drive and grow Marijuana get their $800 a month rent paid through 
secion 8 and live in a gorgeous brick home....my trailer has no water, no heat.....no entrance 
nor exits and then they think they are going to take something away from me? I just went out as 
I do daily to see if my car would start.....it would not......it runs me several hundred 
dollars per month to keep it going and I cannot do it.   It is a 1991 Mercury GM LS but won't 
run.....and I cannot put any more money into it.  Short of being thoroughly taken by the State 
of North Carolina and the woman at the local SS office, Beverly Cates, I don't know what else 
to do except cut the jugular.  She gave me two choices....pay $100 per month or she would take 
all my disability.....now where in H? is the fairness of this...2 years ago.....and an appeal 
had been issued.  I presume that the law does not apply to her........and if I can be lowered 
any lower than I already have been, then so be it.  I have been beaten, held at knife point (to 
my throat) and had the entire home mutilated.     What more can happen to me.  All I own...if I 
own that is a cemetery plot........totally.....and the title to the car that won't run.  So you 
tell me.......I need your help in the worst way and I need it now......I will be faxing you the 
cover sheets for the hearing which is in New Bern and I cannot possibly get there unless 
someone takes me........I hope frankly I am dead by then.  Perhaps then, all will be 
satisfied.......all that are involved or ever will be involved.  I have had heart problems, 
stomach problems and mini strokes......I cannot see with my glasses and have abscesses in my 
mouth......I need a doctor NOW....cannot afford one......they want cash.  YOU TELL ME WHAT I AM 
SUPPOSED TO DO!  I have no money........and family cannot support me.....they have done all 
they can do.  Please let me hear from you....SS #  239-86-5374  DPB 04-18-1951  PLEASE FOR 
GOD's SAKE HELP ME!  WILLIAM STANLEY

24,000 Census Jobs Available for North Carolina
Gov. Perdue on Wednesday announced that 24,000 Census jobs will be available throughout North 
Carolina and signed

Executive Order No. 33 creating the North Carolina Complete Count Committee to coordinate Census 
activities at the state level. 
“More than $400 billion in federal funds will be distributed each year based on the census count, so 
a complete count is critical to North
Carolina,” Perdue said.  “I urge everyone to fill out and mail back their Census forms.  It’s easy, 
it’s important and it’s secure.”
The decennial census will take place on April 1, 2010.  It is administered by the federal government, 
but requires support at the state and local level.  The state’s activities are coordinated by the 
state’s Complete Count Committee (CCC).  Individual localities
 also establish complete count committees, in order to coordinate participation in the census.

The Census Bureau will be hiring for 24,000 jobs throughout North Carolina beginning in January 
2010.  Job seekers can find application information at
www.2010censusjobs.gov or by calling 1-866-861-2010.  The information is also available via the
Employment Security Commission or
JobsNOW.nc.gov.  Some jobs will begin as early as January, while most will begin in February and 
March, and will extend until June or July.
Over $400 billion in federal funds will be allocated annually based on the 2010 Census figures.  
Based on recent estimates, the state will receive approximately $14,000 in federal funding per person 
counted over the next 10 years.  In addition, Census data
 is the basis for the NC State Demographer’s projections, which are used to determine the 
distribution of state funds. 

The Census will also determine whether North Carolina will receive an additional seat in the U.S. 
House of Representatives.  North Carolina narrowly received a 13th congressional district after the 
2000 Census by margin of approximately 800 people.

Governor Announces Steps to Strengthen Ethical Standards for State Boards and Commissions
Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed three executive orders to increase ethical standards for 
gubernatorial appointees to state boards and commissions and for certain designated employees.  These 
orders
 continue to strengthen the commitment to transparent and effective government that began with Gov. 
Perdue’s first day in office.
The new standards include a measure to remove gubernatorial appointees indicted for a felony or who 
refuse to cooperate with a state or federal investigation.
“These orders are another step forward in my commitment to enforce the highest standards of ethics, 
accountability and transparency in this administration,” said Perdue.  “Our citizens deserve nothing 
less than a transparent, effective and
 efficient government that works for North Carolinians.”
Additionally, the executive orders establish an attendance standard of 75% of regularly scheduled 
meetings for boards and commissions, and they extend the Ethics Act to an array of public servants 
who not otherwise be covered.
Other standards established by Executive Orders Nos. 
34, 
35 and 
36 include:
• Governor’s appointees to boards and commissions cannot accept gifts from those who contract with 
their boards, and they must recues themselves from votes in which they have a financial interest.
• New conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements for 17 specific advisory boards and commissions 
not covered by the State Ethics Act.

Logistics Task Force Formed
Gov. Perdue on Tuesday signed

Executive Order No. 32, establishing the Governor’s Logistics Task Force.  The task force will make 
recommendations to ensure that people and goods are able to move efficiently across North Carolina.  
The order was signed at a signing ceremony at the Raleigh
 headquarters of Longistics, a full-service provider of global logistics services.
“We must have an efficient and effective transportation system to move our people, to create jobs, 
and to be sure our economy is globally competitive
 in the 21st century,” said Perdue.  “Transportation is a major part of why North Carolina continues 
to be named the #1 state in America for business.”
The Logistics Task Force will review transportation systems in North Carolina including roads and 
highways, airports, ports, multimodal transportation and railroads.  The review will focus on giving 
North Carolina a competitive advantage in
 economic development by maximizing existing transportation systems and defining priorities for 
future transportation investments.  Lt. Governor Walter Dalton will serve as Chair of the Logistics 
Task Force.
“The Logistics Task Force is going to preserve and create jobs,” said Dalton.  “The ability to move 
goods, people and information efficiently and
 cost effectively is crucial to existing companies and emerging industries in North Carolina.”
The Logistics Task Force is part of Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative to aggressively create jobs, 
train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Annual Christmas Tree Lighting
On Thursday, Gov. Perdue joined Santa Claus and hundreds of children and their families in the annual 
lighting of the Christmas tree on the State Capitol grounds.  The event also marked the beginning of 
the
 Holiday Open House for the Executive Mansion - which ends on Sunday, Dec. 13.  Visit our
eTownhall blog for pictures, video and news of the holiday events. 



Textile Firm to Bring 66 Jobs to Burke County
Marves Industries, an international producer of non-woven textile cushioning and insulator pads for 
use in mattresses headquartered in Mexico, will open a new North American facility in Burke County. 
 The company will invest $1.75 million and create 66 jobs in Hildebran.  The announcement was made 
possible by a $200,000 grant
 from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina continues to attract international manufacturing firms seeking the perfect U.S. 
location to invest and grow,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state’s trained workforce, top business climate 
and exceptional quality of life are spurring
 companies to expand here and create the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.” 
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW 
initiative, the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain workers, and 
lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable
 economic future.

Governor Purdue, Tracy and Glenda called yesterday which was totally unnecessary.  If thinking 
I am going to commit suicide is all you folks can think about and referrals to East Pointe, 
which I would not take my dead cat to see, then you have another thought comimg.  I asked for 
help.......not a recorded conversation and no more calls will be accepted from any office.  If 
you cannot help me, please say so and just be done with it.  To know that you are as 
unconcerned as you are about living conditions and the well being of others concerns me most of 
all.  You were elected TO CARE!  You cannot dismiss problems by delegating them to others whose 
only solutions are "committal to institutions" or phone calls.  I went to the SHIIP site......I 
saw nothing there that would give me help with the ADJUDICATION ISSUE which leaves me in 
limbo.  I would strongly suggest that anyone handling anything about me do their homework 
before they ever make another call to me.  While I was nice and pleasant to the two ladies 
yesterday, I probably won't be so nice next time.  It amazes me that nobody cares........or 
follows up.It really bothers me when people do not know what they are talking about when they 
call me.....and insults me when they accuse me of being suicidal........As the late Ruth Graham 
said once, she never thought of suicide but did consider murder a time or two.   I think we all 
get to that point in our lives and when we have no help forthcoming, it makes it even worse and 
those who do call have no clue as to what they are talking about.  Such is government.  Thank 
you and Merry Christmas.
