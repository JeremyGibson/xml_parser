New information about how much money our state spends on the
problems caused by alcohol, tobacco and other drugs was released
in May by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
at Columbia University.

It is really shocking, because the researchers found that about
15% of ALL state government spending is for alcohol, tobacco and
other drug abuse and addiction and its consequences. The worst
part is that 94% of what states spend on substance abuse goes to
pay for the enormous but hidden burden of this problem on public
programs such as health care, criminal justice, education, child
welfare and mental health -- and less than 3% of this spending
goes for prevention and treatment. 

I urge you to take a really close look at the facts for our
state and read the report here:

We can't afford to continue this crazy, upside down spending
that wastes billions in taxpayer dollars at a time when
resources are scarce and results in untold human suffering. The
new report identifies common sense, inexpensive and effective
prevention and treatment approaches that would help reduce the
costs of substance abuse and addiction.

I urge you to take leadership in developing and implementing a
strategy to move our state from enormous spending on the burden
of substance abuse to investing in effective addiction
prevention and treatment programs.

Please let me know your thoughts on this revealing report. I
would welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue
with you further.
