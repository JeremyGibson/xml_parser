Subject: Support Sensible Poker Legislation

Comment: Alec Robinson 629 Tyler Run Drive Wake Forest, NC 27587-2840 November 21, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I am writing to ask for your support regarding specific actions our great state will be required to take if legislation in the U.S. Congress becomes law. Specifically, two bills to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker have been introduced in the Congress. If either passes into law, our state will have to make a choice. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE FEDERAL BILLS, THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE. We can either participate in the program or opt out of the provisions of the bill. I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Alec Robinson (919) 389-5071

Comment: Jonathan Valand 7817 Harbor Drive Raleigh, NC 27615-4516 December 7, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I am writing to ask for your support regarding specific actions our great state will be required to take if legislation in the U.S. Congress becomes law. Specifically, two bills to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker have been introduced in the Congress. If either passes into law, our state will have to make a choice. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE FEDERAL BILLS, THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE. We can either participate in the program or opt out of the provisions of the bill. I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members, can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Jonathan Valand 919-623-2029
