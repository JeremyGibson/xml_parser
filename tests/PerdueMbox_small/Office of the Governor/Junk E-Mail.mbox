From: MISS LOVELYN PETERS

Dearest One,

It is my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I and my brother Jones, intend to establish in your country.
Though I have not met with you before but I  believe, one has to risk confiding to succeed sometimes in life.

There is this huge amount of ($35,500,000.00) which my late Father deposited in a Bank here in cote d'ivoire before he  died in a ghastly motor accident.   He was a  well known  Contractor, supplying Chemicals to Companies and Hospitals.

Now I and my brother  have decided to invest this money in your country  for security and political reasons.

Our area of interest will be on Real Estate, Hotel, or Petroleum business. Since l do not know your country, and you are the one who knows  it very well, l will be glad to welcome your expert advise on the above subject.

Finally, we want you to help us transfer it into your personal account for a good  and reliable bussiness investment in your country and arrange for travelling documents for us to meet you there.                         

If you can be of  assistance to us we will be pleased to offer to you 18% Of the total fund  or more as we may later agree upon.

I await your soonest response:lovepeters36@yahoo.com
Yours Sincerely,
Miss Lovelyn Peters

	Message: 	I read with interest the article in the N & O this morning concerning the BEACON payroll system. I am not an employee of state government but, if I were, I would be trying very hard to get a class action lawsuit against this state. I don't know who the idiots were that decided this was a great system but there is no way that this is saving the state (taxpayers) time and money. Instead it is stealing money from employees. It really upsets me that this state has not pulled the plug on this disasterous system. No one seems to be smart enough to get it fixed. After all the problems, it seems to me that the state would have kicked it to the curb by now. The employees of this state deserve better. The people responsible for implementing this idiotic and pathetic system should be fired. Obviously, they were incompetent to think this would work. It speaks volumes for our state government that it hasn't been straightened out by now. In my humble opinion, these employees should be paid interest for all the months it is taking to get it fixed. I think your office and all citizens know this is not ever going to work properly. DO THE RIGHT THING AND GET RID OF IT AND STOP WASTING OUR MONEY AND EMPLOYEES TIME TRYING TO FIX A TOTALLY FLAWED SYSTEM!!!!!!!!How would you like to not have money to pay your bills when you have earned it???????? I have no confidence in our state government.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009  I Hope Anyway


oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly  she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs  I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces  there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes  to rpevent issues-  have to look  of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep  that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com  amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on  the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up  by USPS from home  well this was going to amazon  same place  but I got a no  and I know the other reason why  if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something  of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender  so that eliminates that  what else was I thinking  they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure  it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem  but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com  ah  I wanted to say earlier  the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder  EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT  WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk  that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office  the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself  which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up  you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will  but you shouldn't of and  it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen  especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to  i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary  but we didn't want you to do things the way you were  we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE  SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY  MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED  SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking  and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else  just like bank of america  and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US  that is what is wanted  what I think Barack Obama intends to induce  get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt  while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier  but that is it  it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people  and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs  which isn't all that heavy  it's a rural route  not as rural as could be  but it isn't the city  it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules  I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well  and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine  that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again  putting her pen through it  it was weird  and she was one of theirs  that was the one where when I reported a missing package later  that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me  not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over  just implying it  came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast  there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad petty - on youtube  justify my love  like a virgin  Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned  that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example  you'd pull most of your videos  or at least some of the ones I know best  for a material girl  which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority  it's an intersting argument to make  very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09  I did want to add for some  those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand  not all of them are the songs I like hte best  audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

pasted mail list 2 into hannity.com 11:55 EST 1/3/09


there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes  but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open  there si a reason I don't come out in the open  in fact  all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution  I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it  there is sort of this american  it's best if you don't ahve to hide  we want to see you  BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it  and you are kind of forcing me out into the open  and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result  and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes  yes it would be better in time  it isn't right now  for many reasons people cannot handle it  I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas  not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out  it may ahve been the only way  as I stated a few months ago  so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding  but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful  my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden  but you forced it  and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way  I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done  I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it  I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative  itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone  that may not be possible  but  I am worried that you are a planning a surprise  I don;t want antoher surprise  there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

Since then I went on to open my soliciting firm in the United Kingdom and I have manage LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV funds, which was in the United Kingdom..


On the 11 of March 2004,it came to my notice that LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV was on vacation in Spain , he was going for sight seeing when he got on  the commuter train system of Madrid when series of coordinated bombings took place (a suicide bomber with a bag pack on train) in the Madrid commuter train exploded which killed over 191 people and injured a further 2050 and my dearest friend God bless his sole LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV was caught in the incident I always remember when I spoke to him last on the 10th of that month and he told me how Spain was it took me over a year to get over it and come to reality that he was no more. Since then I have paid over £150,000 for the last 4 year to secure this funds I have been looking for any of his relatives since then and only to find out that he was the last generation of the BARKOV Family single and Died at the age of 65years.

	Message: 	Governor Easley, your state might have the same "Critical/Fatal Flaw" as the one mentioned below! Please have someone contact me at 270-757-0993 or rholtzcl47_@hotmail.com!

News media, let me introduce myself, I'm a retired AT&T Area Manager/Engineer, so basically down here in the sticks (Central City), I'm a nobody! Anyway, I have two sons, one who has already graduated from MS (Murray State - Civil engineer) and another one who's still attending MS. During my 25+ years at AT&T, I was responsible for the detailed analysis of 100s of millions of dollars of detailed billing from Nortel and Lucent, so detailed analysis is nothing new to me! During my detailed analysis of my second son's Grades and Grade point Average (GPA) I "uncovered a critical/fatal flaw" in the Grading system that MS's Administration is using! Upon further analysis, I uncovered that this Grading system is used by all the High Schools in the State of Kentucky and about 85% of all the colleges and universities in the country, so this is not just a big issue it's an enormous issue! Although I'm not a lawyer, in my opinion this "issue" makes about 85% of all th e colleges and universities "prime candidates" for "Class Action Lawsuits"! Therefore, if you're interested in sitting down with me to get/understand the "details" you can contact me at my email address above or call me at 270-757-0993. Brushing me off without a follow-up will be the biggest mistake you make this year!

Note: I've already sent several emails to the President of Murray State as well as Ms. Mountjoy (Kentucky's Secretary of Education) and Ms. Spellings (President Bush's Cabinet) and I'm meeting tomorrow with representatives of both of my local newspapers!

Dear,

Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.

Your profile pushed me to send you this mail,I am Mariam Kenzo 21years old and the only Daugther of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.Kenzo. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2005.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth!

My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$10.700,000) left in one of the leading Bank here in Abidjan Ivory coast West Africa.

He further told me that he deposited the money in my name,I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

Dear,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your Sister?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will
be good for you after the money is in your account?

Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.Through my private email box. 

Thank you so much and may God bless you.

Yours sincerely,

Ms Mariam Kenzo

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009  I Hope Anyway

I noticed how the congressman answered the question of being Senator  if that is his worst crime  give him some coupons for those restaurantsthat are on your site as a punishment.  - kfyo - 

2 paste errors on hutchison.senate.gov 8:50 EST - 1/5/09 - 3rd time successful. 

burris has to run for reelection in 2 years.

with Chicago you would have to prove intent  and that will be difficult  but yes the system failed and it is odd

on the 5th and 14th ammendments - the doctors can force you to pay medical bills - like when you are under court order- they tell you to get medication and by court order you have to get it and in my case pay for it.  And yes that is property or money - i ahve to pay it isn;t in the court truling - the court didn't designate me to pay for medication - it designated doctor treatment - - the doctor then can prescribe whatever he wants - you are saying technically that may be a right violation - in addition they did take property - they - by their actions they did - the hospital and the city - the police did deprive me of property and never reimbursed me for it.   it's been 4 years - - end of 2005 - 3 years.  - the bus ticket that went bad because of forced hospitalization worth $300-400 dollars.  - time expired on it while in hospital.

I did write in the browser randy.senate.gov partway  and caught it  8:39 eSt 1/5/09

We keep having references to the fun civil war ammendments-  the 14th ammendment is highly interesting  section 3 in particular  could he do that  he could  oh wow  and in a suit in a heartbeat that would flip  things  and it woudl bealmost cooler to announce the count and then invalidate them and elect the other person.  -

I note that the city of Chicago violated my 14th ammendment rights  when it lost myy motor voter application and I could not vote in the congressional 1998 election because of it  if I can prove intent and their might be intent  in addition section 1 of the 14th ammendment could be added to my case against Pittsburgh due to forfeited property and infringement of liberty  mother is going nuts downstairs  banging of door and motion  so yes the 14th applies to me in 2 different cases  - plus the federal implications  why am I having visions of like a thermo-nuclear explosion politically hitting the north  the equivalent of that  oh wow.   Not a real bomb  but just  I am getting  they are so far over the line  this still all seems like fiction at this point  it is beyond belief.  But yeah that ammendment applies to  we have 6 ammendments that were broken so far known - 1st , 4th 5th, 6th , and 8th , and now 14th  do I hear 7 ? - coughing badly. 

- I did have problems with icy and blurry windshields in cars in CT and IL  in IL I coudln't see in the sun from the streaks on my windshield at one point-  I remember that day  I was driving and I couldn't see out of the windshield -  that's not a good thing  no it's not  which is why I didn't very much  things would happen  - oh the car the AAA guy  who was russian or slavick by accent and who made getting the jump to move my car a huge problem nearly ran into him which would have been a problem  he was giving me bad instruction  constantly calling me an idiot and it seemed while he was standing behind the car in front of mine  parallel parked on those lovely Chicago streets by lake michcagan about 6000 North of downtown  Bryn Mawr- forehead resting on first two finger joints of right hand -  I thought he was telling me to put my foot on the gas to start the car and take foot off the emergency break and he kept calling me an idiot  this is the triple A person  you know when you can call  how stupid are you any way  and there was a witness family  I just was very careful and I didn't hit him but the family who owned the home was watching and were perfect witnesses  I was set up and got lucky - nothing happened  I still felt bad  I could have hurt him  didn;t want to  he put me in a situation by the way he acted with no visible witnesses to help me  where I almost injured him  it would have changed my life  there was no reason he had to stand right in front of my car  but he did  he set up an accident condition.  And yes he was slavick  I said Russian  maybe  could easily have been another slavik  But yes problems witth windshield wiper blades flying off the car  not working properly during heavy CT rainstorms and then during winter.  Frosted windshields in CT definitely a problem  rested forhead on first to finger joints again.  -  I called triple A when my car wouldn't start in Chicago and this is what happened  I never had good luck when people looked at my car  except for buying it and my first boss literally took me car shopping to a person he knew.  - not knowing how to use an automatic teller from drive through in a car. 

A colleague of mine in CMU  suction.com  and the indian in my class for two years  tried to get me to apply and go to Cooper Union and go there  in the year off  mother was against it  it sounded neat to me the way my two former classmates presented it -
Smartmouth mouthwash commercial on kfyo as I write this 8:22 EST 1/5/09


I am an only child as well. 

craddock in TX did the redistricting  that wasn't the most equitable thing as I know of it. 

can we kick Austin out of Texas  um kinda a national problem right now kids is that too many people want to do that sort of stuff on a national scale. 

--
A Middle Eastern Alamo?
I am not a good judge with Israel  I gave my theory  I do stick by it  the people of Gaza will remember this for a long time  and will feel  or I would feel less remorse at striking at Israel if I were one of them after an incident like this  isn't that a problem?   Have your really worked fully on methods to abduct or capture the people you deem responsible for the bombing without harming the rest of the population? - These pictures invite world outrage  Israel must know that  like almsot yhou are baiting the world to react  in honesty  like the Us(US) and colombia  when (you) do raids  don't you try to hit hard and fast minimize troop exposure to danger  get the targets quickly versus dragging out a campaign  I do not udnerstand any longer and have to again raise a flag-   What are you doing  besides levelling a city it looks like.  (unless this is the only way).

the mastermind of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, exhorted Palestinians to "crush" Israeli forces and to target Israeli civilians  that an interesting line -

and their rocket attacks concur with that  so the problem is that the leaders are hidden and the civillians are protecting them  would any of the civillians leave with the Israelis- into refugee camps while other business was going on in the city?   To clear the civillians not involved out of the way  or is that too hard to discern  I guess long term  if you are doing this it does make sense to be thorough -  i hope that it achieves the best outcome  again I think that if you did that to me  if you bombed me and forcibly took away the people i elected  maybe the election was done through terror  but that would encourage resentment that would not go away.   Do you have a second part after clearing out the people who may well just want to kill Israelis ?   Scratching back of head with right hand  you did say a permanent change in the situation.

60 Minutes  the wire for my keyboard is loose  I should have a still working spare and this one still works  yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer  it is odd how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV  itching  left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth  I was feeling aversion to writing this up  it is going now  maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney  said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time  my old license pla from Chicago  someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there  worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer  neat trick  the lights do blink  num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like  happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate  NY Prosecutor deterring drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder  this is a highly troubling story  and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems  the rammifications are not so simple  I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver  but as I cough up a little phlegm  here's the thing on this  I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude  bury him under the court  very vengeful  and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that  Someone is cackling somewhere  because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone  and that is the point  BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be  we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one  you can't win  be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink  he or she wasn'tr thinking  they lost control of the vehicle  and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case  a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident  the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown  it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent  to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case  you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women  but men may drink more  be expected to drink in more situations  I don;t know the stats  but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink  I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving  But the issues is  drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to  unless . . . .. intent can be determined  which in honesty even right now I bet it can  but not in a way that is admissable in court  but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing  the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink  it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk  that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along  he always made a big deal about that  I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish  when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me  it bristled me quite a bit  today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt  but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while  it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in  it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me  my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years  but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner  and I wouldn't have ordered there without him meniktoning it to me  and I didn't like  food was fine  it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk  I know with drugs  a professor bascially endorsed it by being there  and also smoking  it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving  second one  with brownies  funny brownies  I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor  we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it  again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases  with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs  and that is the big problem  oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs  and they probably could if they wanted to somehow  but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading  it has been done for quite a well  but we are talking about CMU  and trusting the wizards of CMU  DON'T  at least not at first  while brain patterns may be critical  I see a flaw in the study  but the premise can brain patterns be read  from my experience it certainly appears so  so the premise is not fully flawed  there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues  do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful  to me  I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003  there was a MRI of my brain  well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005  like in 2002 or 2003  there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff  but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test  the computer images didn't come up  and the person  female  dark hair  did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial  the data was wasted  because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons  like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B  C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study  because my data was thrown out  yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that  MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes  though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking  school pyschologist at CCAC  in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution  we were talkign about medication  he used the phrase won't you try a little bit  and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me  on Dec 23 2005  used the same phrase  won;t you try a little bit  when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no  in the emergency room  I did not say not  and I said maybe and maybe even yes  because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them  that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor  that female  reminded me of Jessica Lynch  from DAM  odd thing there.  Just a coincidence. 

But now maybe that I have shown how CMU helped me  perhaps I should help CMU  I am scared of these guys  Do they encourage the thought of window from the same picture-  because they said they generically know the brain pattern of window thought  what parts of the brain a person will use for window for any person  yet they haven't tried every stimulus or even a corpus of stimuli to indcue the thought of window  touching a window in a natural setting  may send a very different brain signal than the black and white image of window used  do different pictures of window have the same brain location  the word window  hearing it  hearing the sound of a double hung window being shut  they ahve those in Pittsburgh  mother got awning windows in this house oddly which the hurricane shutters on the top floor block from opening because of the low ceilings  8 foot versus the builder wanted 9 foot  that does not seem to be accidental.  - but the good people at CMU  should not say they know a generic pattern of thought  their data is too preliminary  with just using the same picture.    Their time horizon is very optimistic for a machine that can fully read someone's mind  I can be wrong  but no one who is deceiving the machine  not a test where subject  can think about any object from any reference they have at least as a grounding should be there  the technology will not be 100% accurate from what they have shown  or that iws not proven and I worry about using that as court evidence for a while  I think it might be like cancer drugs.   We'll see a few of them come and go.    CMU is getting more corrupt  or corrupted by powerful money  it was while  I was there  odd to have CMU and Texas Tech together in 60 minutes.  - Rubbing back neck after touch by both eyes  index knuckle bottom to right cheekbone top and index finger to left, left eye edge and palm on neck all with right hand 

Texas Tech Football  fairy tale brings NFL money and influence  I don't want to talk about the Texas Tech football team  I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons - - oh my keyboard just blinked  ho oho  but I guess we are switching things a bit  Okay with that done let's talk D &D  The Zhentarim are presented i nthe way Dugneons and Dragons presents evil where for the most part the villain just wants to eventually get you onto a torture wrack and take al lyour magical items  but the Zhentarim in the Forgotten Realms setting do build a network of spies in smaller towns like Shadodale  home of Elminster the Seer  the most pwoerful I think mage in Faerun as Forgotten Realms is called-  Elminster moves to Faerun(Shadowdale) after many adventures he isn't born there  it isn't the size of Saerloon i nthe summer which if I remeber reaches over 200,000 but defintiely not quite 300,000 just yet  Saerloon is something like that in its prime seasons.  But we are talking about shadowdale and the zhentarim like having a network of spies but being in dungeons and dragons they're evil and pose as shady merchants, only occassionally do you see villain in D &D get real villain smarts and like totally infiltrate a good com munity posing as something they're not  polymorph others spells and many to later one's appearance do exist And definitely in Zhentil keep in one time period 2 Devils pose as a ruling couple of humans and no one knows their disguise within Zhentil Kepp for a long time.   - Coughing as I write that-  nearly lopped off my right big toe toenail with my left heel  pushing up on nail as I crossed my feet.   Gelatine from gummy bears does get your toenails to grow doesn't it Haven't had to clip them in months.  What did mother give me oh -  and she bought precisely two boxes of gelatine  jello  that is the other reason forsmall amounts of food  she controls dosages of nturients like medicine  rubbing left side of face with left hand as I write that and hir cheeck with palm and top of head left side in hair with fingers.  Wasn't an even rub.   Oh this is such a good horror movie.   Dropped this keyboard a little  common theme that  gget distracted for a minute  thinking about buying used versus buying new stuff at amazon and high school and looking up one of the people from elementary school yesterday online like I did antoher classmate  get into loop of thought  get out of it and rub left corner of motuh with left thubm  pass gas as I write that up  -touched thumbs as I identified ti as a loop of thought  but Zhentil keep is not like Sauron in the second age  where he comes as the bearer of gifts and good tidings and comes into the isle of Numenor as a fair person and only slowly corrupts them  this is before the war of the ring series by a thousand years or so  Second age  war of the ring ends the third age.  Mother is up 6:31 EST can hear her moving downstairs.  Biting into hand another pimple or small scab on hand  whitehead on my right thigh last night  they had mostly healed for a while  back to story -  there aren't many athletic contests within Dungeons and Dragons  jousting is mentioned in the C  it'sbeing blocked  before Imortals and Master  -but after Basic and Expert  I want to say Companion  that's not it  it is Companion  in the Companion series  they do talk of jousting and hosting a jjousting tournament as a noble lord  and rules on that.  Rubbed all around head as I began to suspcet that ti was companion - - nwo a yawn  they do nto want me to write this one  it is funny to watch this  and not so funny  but In Dungeons and Dragons at least in the rule book one doesn't getting into how to maximize revenue from a joust very much  of course in the model given  the lord or owner pays for the peasants to come to the joust and ti is  means to keep them happy  no lord invented the idea of makiing the peasants pay for their own holiday.  And yes agian no one thought of how to maximize revenue or attendance and interest in a jousting tourfnament in Dungoens and Dragons  it just isn't that important to other goals of the companion set such as the eventually goal of some charctgers to battle with the monsters in the world or other issues  jousting is far down the list much of the time.  We probably don't get into the idea of fairytale jousting tournaments and their imapct on peasant interest in jousting because of course dungeons and dragons si a fairy tale and the idea of the little prince being crowned king is quite easy to produce in dungeons and dragons and doesn't have to be faked and managed to happen  it happens all the time  in fact is boring and we moved on to crowinging the dark elf rebel as a noble above ground.  
That was one thing I wanted to get into  antoher  ya know when looking over Palladium and Rolemaster or middle earth both of which use the same gaming system  from Iron Crown Enterprises  one would wonder why the company is named after the Iron Crown of Morgoth  details details  but all three of those games have like 8 to ten attributes to describe a cahracters basic abilities unlike dungeons and dragons which has 6  and therein actually USED to lie its beauty  it relatively simple game mechanics and then too many physicist and experts on hand to hand combat got together and now  apaprently in the 3rd edition there was a rules compendium put togehter just for the different  AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH  and it won appeal originally on its simplicity even if its depictions of combat weren't perfectly realistic  your fighter can take more damage than four warhorses  really ?  - but I digress  attributes I was focusing on attributes six attributes of dungeons and dragons  in particular things have shifted over the years  but I didn't want to get into the full history  instead  in Dungeons and Dragons when evaluating a person's mental abilities  the psionicist for example  intelligence over the ability to analyze data quickly is not just one stat  or being intelligent is not just one stat  it is actually 2 if not 3 stats  maybe even 4.   There is of course Intelligences which would be the stat that would be used in analyzing and calculating so many calcualtions per second or seeing a pattern and the raw recognition of a pattern or the many movements and getting to a pattern that would be under the attribute of intelligence  what used to be and still the traditional needed stat to be a wizard  of course in the third they introduced sorcerers who cast wizard spells but usede Charisma as the prime stat for their power and not intelligence or raw number crunching.  Charisma has changed over the years as it is hard to define  my definition currently may not fully match the games either  it used to sort of be good looks  it is definitely at first the characteristic a football coach would possess that drive and passion that can be used to sway the audience  but in current editions it has changed  and in 3rd edition I think  Charisma became more like Wisdom used to be and the drive the force of will  that became part of charisma's protfolio as an attribute  which is not there in the 1st edition  but it is there now and having a high Charisma is necessary to being a sorcerer.  Many sorcerers in the game tend to be loners it is noted here.  And the last definite mental trait of dungeons and dragons is wisdom used for clerics or priests  but wisdom is the ability stil lto see rammifications of actions and make good decisions based on the information one concludes  it is one thing to use Intelligence to analyze a situation quickly and rapidly and reach the right understanding of the plaiyng field  it is another thing to have the wisdom to take the right actions  many spell casters have higher mental attributes in all mental categories than physical  admittedly a high dexterity is useful for spellcasters to be able to duck out of the way when objects get thrown at them - - that did happen at nights as a freshman and sophomore at CMU when random people threw things at me as I ran on the track of Gesling stadium.  - just a remembrance  they did it fro mtheir dorm windows I think and I could not tell who was doing it  it made me move somewhere else to run.  Rubbed left cheekbone with right index finger.   - but to finish off  Being rated high mentally as a character in dungeons and dragons involves not only a high intelligence  but also wisdom and charisma  and one last score score also comes into play  Constitution  the ability to endure physical pain  and it was implied in older version that Constitution also was about enduring mental pain  I am thinking that should be Charisma to balance things out and make more sense.  Just checked it is in the 4th edition.  And the point kiind of was to push it out a bit  Some people can be very good in their analytic capabilities and lack wisdom to draw the right conclusions or the Charisma to challenge the status quo.  As I said earlier  I normally played a Wizard in the old game and now i would switch to Sorcerer.

son to inauguration  leadership thing  I was in a leadership meetings at CCAC  best way to bring country together is to sue rick Warren  BUT  IT IS NOT BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER  EVANGELICALS LIKE IT  BUT THE GAY COMMUNITY DOESN'T AND IT IS HIGHLY ODD OBAMA DID NOT SPOT THAT WEDGING  IT IS SEPARATING THE COUTNRY ON AN ISSUE VERSUS UNITING IT  AN ODD THING FOR A EEOC PRESIDENT ELECT TO DO

catholic  not as christian I guess-  that was used in CMU  freshman  Gary would say catholics aren't Christians  to me  freeshman and sophomore year-  caller knows that somehow -

my god isn't exclusionary  but I don;t call him that- you miss that aprt  and I want the ceremony the way I beleive and with my worship practices and to exclude yours  -which is what you want-  why do you win? - that gets to be the issue  we use a way during the ceremony  so you pick one as favorite

name dropping duncan hunter  benediction does not mean warren is in Obama's camp -   Jesus and his disciples only went where wantred- doesn't relate in truth -

Obama elected presidnet  actually not yet  Jan 9th  the electors come out  in addition if he is an illegal immigrant  if he has criminal acts  the election will not be the deciding thing and I thinki both of those statements are ture.  -  

fried chicken is not fundamental issues-  if we are one country we should get down to one set of fudnamental values-  there are some things that are left grey-  not certain thigns- we ahd a discussion about that in 1860  and everyone doesn't get that -  and you should have an opinion on your country  this idea  it's not important  it is the country  those couple thoughts are what do and what should bind us  the rest is individual -  and this southern bullshit idea of disagreeing without beign disagreeable  that is southern  northerners  USED to argue like hell even strangers and you don't get shot  that is the north  I know from DAM when I did UNCT TV  fundraising  the souterners have this no talking thing  don't say something to upset- no instead you have a civil war-  that is what happens when you don't force out things that need to be said-  the south is wrong on that  argue with each other to acheive solidarity  the south is wrong on being pleasant when you actually disagree  it doesn't work  and makes a weaker country.

Jay- I think =- how are u  saying positive  for gays  but no problem with pastors at inauguration  - not necessarily intolerance -  it's overestimating the importance of this  it says a lot about application of constitution -  you don't seem to want me to write anymore allen  so I won't  this guy is clever  several things I could write  but same as others

Eric  if I were gay I'd be happy  missed that till allen says it  are u born atheist  wow  - you're not  born a christian

Mike  advice  people should pay attention to what matter in their lives and not butt in to other people's life-  worry about bread instead of free speech  and no Idon;t agree  you can;t walk over me and get me to worry about my stomach  cancer or being full.    I did miss the last point  2 men getting married is not a basic block  of society  he slipped another one in  they are trying a new style to slip stuff under4 the radar that sounds more natural.    The other style was too easy to catch.,   - marriage is a legal contract though  he held his points until I started typing  we will catch them.

Gay people can be for gay lifestyle-  caller  can speak out against it-  but do gay people get ssame rights  that is where the line is  do you recognize that?  - radical gays better watch  get straight community upset  so the radical gays better watch what they say  ah that pesky 1st ammendment is being burned and I am wlaking into a trap  just like the second phrase in this paragraph  all rights should be taken with good ethics  which gets rid of inappropriate outbursts  where there are some  the law handles them and not other people deciding soemthing should not go on  that idea is what is a problem  that you can decide what is inappropriate for your neighbor without going through recongized channels -  people don't think the legal thing applies jsut lena on your neighbor until they get the message and that is illegal  but it is done.

I am not a conservative or liberal  follower of christ  that is total BULLSHIT allen  you ahve poltiical opinions-  people of faith do by default IF they believe their faith  do not try that  I don;t care line- you could be a moderate on every issue-  but you're not on gay marriage  you have opinions  not poltical  is a lie-  everyone has opinions  most won;t be honest- it is costly and sometiems hard to be honest. 

- what if he chose jeremiah right -  happny new year  Democrats and republcians cut from same cloth  soem dems and Rs  not cut some  extreme right wing view ridiculous-  Rick warren isn't honest

Scott  missed name  baptist guy  just espouting  jealous pf Rcik warren  H jealous of preacher  I think preachers may be calling a spade a spade

 Obama frightens people because he is unknown - unknown frightens people  I have information  some things in Bush  things that people can never know about in this coutnry  caller is coutnry dropping  H curl your nose hair  I do have nose hair problems - - saying I will never be known

why can't people jsut get along  greed  or simply there are cookies to fight over and people still look at eating cookies instead of planting them and getting a cookie tree as a better deal. 

mistype Firefox can't find the server at www..allenhuntshow.com.- 18:47 EST 1/4/09  passe gas as I reported this. 

another tin from the same company from mother when I mentioned them  my stomach is upset again  though no other affects yet. 

Kim -  prayer  is about Obama  not really about coutnry-  say what??? - get beyond your own agenda as a person  um so lie essentially  form of idoltry to have own opinion -  H  like princess of the pea  Victor Funderburk where are ya  yes she is antoher funny caller- caller-  she has gay friends last gay calel4r had Christian friends  odd all that -

itched privates as I emailed Ron Paul  8:43  and passed gas in last 2 minutes  didn't catch it

american who happens to be gay  not important the pastor- she is lying or not real  and she emphasized Bush thrown out  she is a palnt  not authentic at least.   18:42 Est  Janet

it is odd Obama could not have pciked someone more palatable to the gay community for the inaugural when you put it that way  I hand't thought about it. 

ahteists at 2% - that community is growing very quickly  then  1.4% in 2001 non-denominational  atheists and everyone else. 

Freedom should be more important than bread in a better world  it is not a better world and bread is more important than freedom -

separate but equal wasn't that decided in board of education ? - that is the issue with legal marriage  marriage is being redefined legally not in a religious sense and the religions do not hold sway legally.  The legal definition of marriage should comply with other laws of the country and not discriminate. 

Obama  we're not going to agree on every single issue  disagree without being disagreeable  um during the Bush years  his detractors were not disagreeable while disagreeing  get the conservative talk show host reeducation center ready and I will be put on Risperdal -  you cannot really disagree without being disagreeable  you won;t be honest- midwesterners aren't  they made Barack Obama  and that is not a good thing  complete fiction -  the midwestern way  it's flaw are on display right now. 

should preachers be at a presidential ceremony  no  not really  should be a judge  not at the oath or  whatever  it is more Christian than not  reflective moment perhaps

Wesley sleep program  autistic son iwth medication  oh yes you are in the mark levin commercial traditon  I see  kfyo 18:19 Est

It is important for America to come together  Backy  that is the line that scares me  with him that means  you may disagree with me  I ma holding a gun to your head buddy  come together with me and work with me or else  that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president  no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen  that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer  um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person  should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue  it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be  and that is regrettable. 

I forgot Rex -

and a little spider came down from the ceiling as I wrote the section below  spinning a line down between me and my computer  very small spider.   - the psider on my screen twice with Senator Warner  a year ago or more now. 

from movie critic to music video critic -
I guess I will say this it does apply to both groups that I saw  maybe a group and a person  I made the  comment on using a video to tell a story  music video to tell a story  there is some difference between what both of you are doing and what the groups I named are doing  there videos are tighter - the graphic story being told takes precedence over the performance  NOW IT IS COMMON WITH LOGICAL COHERENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE A PERFORMANCE COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE STORY LINE IN THE VIDEO AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE GOOD DO THAT  they give you hell, hope it gives you hell   they perform when they are artists in the video  logical placement  it's sort of like product placement but you are placing yourself-  but it is done in character -  other groups like to have the performance throughout, but not in places where it fully lends itself to the story they are trying to tell on the video   in a recent video and in this group's case  the themes in the videos are getting stronger  the story is stronger as the group gets older-  shall we say it's not the worst thing to have  that happen  but if I compare you on that idea  of STICKING TO THE SCRIPT  you have lines in your song  that don't directly reference graphically in the video  if you talk abou all this stuff in a mall  that feeling of all this stuff should carry on the video and in that place it gets abstracted and is a weak reference  if one of the singers is singing the part about a character at the mall  but she is performing and acting like a musical performer when that is not what she is singing about  that is logically inconsistent  that is another issue  IF you want to do this or want a video structured this way  when you jump it has to be logical  We didn;t start the fire has 4-5 different sets  jumps many times  and to a coffin  the jumps are very carefully thought out and I bet if I look referenced to song breaks  others like weird spacey shots in the middle of meaningful lines- and start off a theme of being a food court  and there is a mugging or theft  but it isn't perfectly clear what is going and then it jumps out of that scene  make the point and THEN jump out  and like if you built in  on the strong end theme of the song  sort of mall excess-  you build in vignettes in the mall excesses-  it can be corny and fun and zany it just has to aid the punchline which there is one at the end  but not all of what is shown up to that aids in building to that punchline -  like put the space stuff on the TV screen in the mall or maybe some fountain or display piece  the zany stuff could even be a cue at the end of each scene  it doesn't have to be disappear  just be placed and located better and look like you control the script versus pieces seem uncontrolled  that is the main difference  that and you jump in such a way that the story line can;t fully logically function and the ones I mention before do not do that.  And you can do wacky stuff like ride a bike through the mall  but what happens around the bike and and where the bike goes should relate to the song and what is being sung  it only loosely does that. 

 that is the idea-  you also put in pieces of you just singing when it's not chorus and they are substantive lines  description in the song  which disrupts continuity in getting into a story  If you want a tighter video  you may not  you like sort of zany theme where it doesn' fully come together

  - Someone else was trying to do that with a ship and a movie   If that is your point   If you do want a video more to the story of the song versus an outtake of a performance - when you sing in the video it has to make sense in the story you sing in a separate shot from the clips of the movie -  if you are sang to the lover on the side in certain places while the action is moving but the romantic male lead is doing something  like you are singing to him as he is in a picture frame moving through action and then the scene changes  - that would work and the singer is the narrator  your song sort of lends itself to you being a narrator and a moment maybe frozen or minimized again in a picture frame on screen while the words and the singer become prominent and then scene change and story is full  singer is hidden  it's that type of song and lends itself to that.  Versus the jar of one moment story and the next singer  they are two separate worlds  never mixed at all and it's a video  they should be intertwined.  Liked that movie and I liked the song above. 
For the song above before that  you could have security cams in the mall as the scene changer like end each mini-scene with like the eye of a security cam and go into it for the next scene  or use that for one scene  a Tv for another one  like that  where does the wackiness come from  and both of those could be somewhat logical places.  Like on pleasure seeker  at a cosmetics booth with free samples  at the food court getting free samples-  in a mirror trying on dresses or whatever else  using different things sold at the mall  one cool way  start with one and like put it in a video lense and like add one lense and then add 2 lense  each lense the same singer but seeking pleasure in a different way and at end of that section zoom into new lense and new part of the mall and start next scene.   - for singing the video  Tv screens music covers  even a digital picture frame or a computer laptop these days.  Or soemthing odder like the crystal ball of a fortune teller or maybe in one of the gumball machines.  - just soem thoughts cheers. 


there was an ad on hulu.co m for a website on education  not council ad2go.comm  that is not perfect  ti was like a gladitorial arena  but with people representing subjects and one even had equations on his body  pitting knowledge as sort of fighting for knowledge  but sort of a takeoff on the advice I gave on learning lessons from rock videos and applying it to education  of course this was not truly done with intent  just a commercial that seems to be a takeoff on something I said a day ago on hulu.com today 1/4/09  that stuff happens so often I stop recording it  they had skeletons of a pair of gladiators at one point for like biology.  - but again not truly to educate  and an ad for a website  ho ho.  + - passed gas while writing this. 

accidentally put the email list #5 on boortz.com  forgot what was on clipboard  had dinner  ro brought up dinner to have  and that assisted my forgetfulness  rubbed back right side with right thumb and the did something else as I wrote this up.  16:27EST 1/4/09

part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time  the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news  the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh  which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't  I watch those  I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me  the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09  did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity  true-  things we're still funny in elementary school  why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident  in that wondrous pattern  2 of those in primary school  in addition the third who hung around mom  not the kid  the mother  less contact with them -  that was and now looks funny - and in high school  the car accident  and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school  there is  a funny pattern  not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong  BUT  it is there  both high school and primary school contain - funny incidents  where I now go  how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it  isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson  an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil  Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working  NEEDING FUEL  yet the price of gas if under half  there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas  the rascals are still trying to drive that up  givng the political environment of the US  it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now  and then as OPEC cuts production  buy tons of oil contracts  jack the hell out of the oil price again  ship in a polar bear or two to congress  whine global and preach alternative energy policy  the evil Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally  or rascally  investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen  the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND  the polar bear comes in  A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy  in Congress  I can see it now

Drilling in Utah  robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone  of course if you know geology  all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled  no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent  didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years  but land does not stay pristine  that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen  and that can take 10,000 years  so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda  rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that  we hear Robert Redford instead  hmmm.   Not much data on impact either  just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers  no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts  that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong  first weathering  it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone  but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava  it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT  in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly  cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change  os even if it is the same land  it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest  I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls  one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil  these deluded souls who support green technology and forget to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff  they had evidence for 10 years  so what I've got about 6 years left  I see.   Not surprised at this point. 





CBS  Shawano WI  hit men for entire town or 60 public officials  Canadian who mentions he has an Italian connection and thus the mofia  and one other things bothered me  they are trying to get better at taking away initial thoughts and mother is doing that more often  hired to kill politicians in a small town  mayor had to stop her open door policy  no  trying to find the other one -they are trying to get expert on taking one thing away from me when I am writing down and they-  did like I got the nudge to write this up write now and not watch other stories  they are testing how well they can make forget a response within in a minute  which was used in court before-  where I couldn;t remember a key point at trial  that I wanted to counter of the doctors.   They are practicing so they always get it right  they get in the ehtnic thing which is from recent and they got in one other thing that is from recent writing - - AH  I got it back  the journalist was the source of evil in the piece  he was a very evil person for what he said the two guys on the street- they were blocking that from me and I got it back  15:12 EST  1/4/09  they are getting an AWFUL lot of practice on me  that is a bad thing and I guess it is nice not to be in court too  but they are trying to focus on making me forget every time  and here it looks like I remembered.   CBS is a communist organization  it is the representative of the group who may have hired the hitman saying that-  that some people think CBS is a communist organization  but it got in the piece  in addition  this was initially the only clip I could see  other than the full news  I talked about how for some reason the window was small  oddly  it is usually larger  so someone gamed it so I see this  I foudn the solution  before I saw this  but looked anyway.  - next  mother just came up after I finished this by 30 seconds  mentioned mice-  she has threatened that with the food here if  it stays in here  I will get a mouse  which happened in Pittsburgh twice.    We'll see. 

cbs seems to have forgotten the scroll bar on its video page  just a coincidence  not a coincidence  well  other associated videos have cropped up that have been helpful and me not seeing any but two of the available videos there unless I am does help prevent that from happening. 

See we scored another shot  cloning is evil  instead of introducing clones  you'll starve half of Africa and South America to death with your solution  I would take gladly the madness of cloning anyday  idiocracy.  - yu aren't  I know Japan said coopt the friendly videos  remember that segment like a month ago and they have tried to do it on youtube  and I did rub my face when I said cloning isn't a big deal and it isn't or at least it's not what some religious in the US make it out to be  I did get into a discussion about cloning with the recruiter in 2004  in Oakland  a brief comment  and he was disapproving  but I defeated his argument  the religious hang up of the military and others with its draw backs  like I will remember to envision the mayan ruler cutting his penis to feed the sungod when I think of your hangups with me in the future  I do feel it comes VERY close to being that stupid.  - next  you left the point to the end though  on hulu.com  good strategy  for various reasons I was sort of prepared for it to go that way.  Clones of the future perhaps replacing in time the current ones who like different, but think and act the same way  cuase obviously looking the same but being your own person is far worse than looking different but being compelled and acting the same  I am pretty sure the latter would doom society faster.   The first scenario might actually get the idea to vary the DNA in their place of residence every once in a while  the second gorup won;t.  Scratching left and right sides of face with respective hands and top of head iwth left hand.    I do get that you are chilling and heating my room  or I did suspect that.   - Itching right knee with right fingers.    Last episode of buck rogers on hulu.com. 

and I do get that the objective is to get rid of the USA and upturn the world order which will give strength to the weaker countries  but shor term will cause reat instability and long term will retard the growth of man  someone is trying to later get other countries on top  to do that you have to kill the leader.  But in this caswe it is not just a power struggle  there is a plan behind it. 

11:09 EST mother came up here to tell me we have laundry chute ( where she has lost clothes for several critical weeks)  but it was jus as I was thinking something else  calling me to brag you have a child as a high school roommate and a job and that seemed to be the reason for calling.  - I was looking over what I have of palladium deciding whether or not the larger guides to it are worth putting my savungs on the line or not  the answer is coming back  no  it suffers from middle earth's problem  from I.C.E  Iron crown enterprises  a system that on paper looks good and very detailed and interesting, but in practice will function poorly  too hard to keep track of all the details  rubbed left nostril side with right thumb- palladium is a bad rules system  he wassn't trying to help me  he was trying to cut down on the time I spent doing something else during high school  calling up to bragf later in 2004.  He kept copies of my drawings  the start of the collection  he wasn't a friend  none of them were.   Mother tried to get me down there before  they wanted me down there so people could see me.   And I got fired there  first place in my life.  And he knew the rat fink who ran it  head of the foundation  and the visit from another while in 3rd year in CMU.  - So trust no one is agood motto.  He is an American American as well  several generations.  - Because he used Palladium  they were afraid of the computers.   How many more smurfs am I going to see?  Rat fink  very wealthy rat fink  relatively wealthy  local radio show host to CT called him that  that ties it in with another group- all roads lead to the crossroads  uggggghhhhh. - he iniated those games senior year and it was very odd.

seeing finally and it did take me a while  that perhaps the biggest issue that Pittsburgh had with me above all else is that it couldn't control me  that I did get myself into a lifestyle where something couldn't just and take away my freedom and that no one else could push on me and get me to do something I didn't want to do  and they want people in that mode  where they have a mortgage and like a career job and debts that mean they have to live like that OR if an artist that they are tied to a group and to clients that support them  a person who needs little income and has no great debts is not someone you can't control  my student loan is $200 at most and not that currently  if I wanted I could pay it off now  and they gathered that because I paid more than the monthly payment in Pittsburgh  so it's not even really what I said  what I did  etc etc that's the big problem  it is being free and not welded into the system in a way they can push on me.  Forehead resting on first two index fingers  it's blatant political control  many will feel  didn't you get that?  NO  Everything I read says that's not supposed to happen  the employee leaving the door open to the commercial store and the 4 year old got in and played with the toys in the store  Pittsburgh didn't lock the door  and they blame me.   But that anology also implies that any other place will have similar conditions  and I'm sorry that's not fully acceptable to me  in other every one of you is lying about the true circumstances and none of the laws are real, all the regions of the US exercise control like that and you'd do the same Pittsburgh did  where they were trying to push me into a career and a lifestyle I didn't want and so you don;t look at Pittsburgh and say you should never do that  to you it is just  they messed up and don't want to admit it.  So you wouldn't let me write free and clear either.  I don't know  and you're not talking  and even if you were I couldn't believe what you said anyway.   But law isn't really the law if what goes on goes on  it's a tool to use in certain cases, I am  like for control  I'll have to find out and I may not agree with decision and may reject it  but for blatant  just we are supposed to be able to force him to do whatever we want to  and if we can't  we're gonna kill him.  Rubbed bottom of nose with left index knuckle  there is an element of that in my case  not just  hating my ideas and this and that  they don't approve of letting young people wander about on their own  they want control of them and were under the dellusion that they had control of me.    And it's blatant poltical force and power and a community's very strong desire to rule itself with an iron fist  stronger than I ever imagined a human could have- like in ethics and morals-  to me being like that is very immoral  very destructive.   It also only works if you're quiet- because when a stand in for Rush Limbaugh tells me I'm going to the gym  I don;t get that that means mother is coming home with those heavy bags of salt and I will have to haul them  just like in Pittsburgh I missed their cues or only would understand them later.   Where you're saying something and you're not really saying something.   The US is going to have to decide what type of country it is going to be  I am not in a position to make the decision on that- but I will pass judgment as best I can from where I sit and if that carries weight so it does.   To raise me with one set of values my whole life and be lying to me the whole time  well good day.    The Corps the Corps is father and kill anyone who gets in its way  ho ho ho ho ho ho ho  I almost sound like Santa Claus. 

kfyo 8:50 EST 1/4/09  even this show is interesting  caller with God on a real estate deal  it wasn't through clever economic manuevering  it was the grace of God  we want people deranged and thinking the world runs on strawberry shrotcake so they are easier to manipulate.  Whooppee.

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time  right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly  then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched  8:13 Est  just can't stop it. Ho ho ho  right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that  and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days  figure out how to do this to people  wow.

the truth potentially  IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show  and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie  maybe not started by him  but he believed that too  that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care  ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY  THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT  THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO  IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn  they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know  much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds  20 -30 east flying heading north  I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities  most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example  to make money he or they could just do another movie  or write a book  a charity is not  there is work and cost  like to take people's compalints and research them  even if the idea is to block the complaint  someone has to take and research it  and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it  licking upper lip and now coughing  one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be  that charities are easy money  a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY  THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL  YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months  or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior  there are potential others  a form of of population control  etc etc  in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity  OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class  to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society  really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money  cancer research instead of education funding  making education super expensive  conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end  you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead  I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization  like I can't believe it  it would so not demoncracy  I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces  we can pass any law we want to  I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment  coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going  the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus  the other stimuli did not stimulate well  the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others  then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade  this would include IL too  it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible  transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces  it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional  someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster  any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces  which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns  Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama  that does happen  but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing  with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction. 

FL -  had first MIA in gulf war which sort of explains things now. 

Spanish version jonah is also expensive on amazon  they are blocking messages they want to eliminate.   Repent or God will killl you is the message of Jonah. 

And when designing a new role playing game it's not really cool that you swipe from my mind what I am writing about and like try to find people who have already designed it  like games that exist that sue a feature I thought up  scratched the back of my head on the word cool in the first line  If coke and pepsi and the rest are so big on proprietary information  they certainly aren't respecting mine  I can;t even get into the computer format stage-  where the ideas go from roughly pencilled notes to being typed up  they're already lifted and people are trying to say - we'll see they laready did this - they have failed to show that, but like if you can do that to me, little prevents one from lifting ideas out of other people's heads in say major corporations  and clearly you want a double standard  it is illegal to do it to you  but with someone like me, you'll cheat and you steal it from my head and then claim it's yours.  Like you showed two games that incorporate  the first was a clear-  see she did it first with Battle Galactica, but it sounds a little different than what I have in mind.  Rubbing corners of with thumbs  each thumb on the correct side- touching thumbs as typing -  one part is similar  the other part is not.   The other seemed more friendly and more of a  they might be interested in what you have to say.  But yeah like it's one thing for political but you steal every idea I have even while you are ardent defenders of the patent system which of course becomes rubbish if you can read a person's ideas.  No it's more important than ever  but it's a complete fake  someone does invent things  but the claims could easily be falsified- it becomes fairer not to allow exclusionary claims which will actually prevent theft than allow theft  the person making the exclusionary claim may well be the thief.  Rubbing left eye with left middle finger.  Even in the spell recharge in unearthed arcana not quite what I do.  

I did wake up at 1am last night  but it was momentary  they tried to get me to go to the bathroom  but they didn't have anything more a notion than a need  I went back to sleep and woke 3:40 Est  their power on me is weak  the reason mother and they are so keen to get me out of the house-  the other telepaths have lost the connection and with my changes in appearance or something they can't do what they used to do  they may have gotten photos yesterday.  But yes they can no longer interrupt my  sleep the way they used to.  I do have to walk to the post office to return a package.  I could see if I could call for a pickup.  - also the tongue blisters  that stopped  a few  like in the last couple nights  a few seem to come temporarily  but they too weak  it only lasted like an hour or two.  - coughing  mother can only do so much on her own  and the reason she is key to get me outside is so that other telepaths can help  because right now they are getting neutralized to a large degree- perhaps they are holding  not over several days  the overnights issues are stopping-  during the day when mother is awake is what is left.  - had to rub right cheek and left wrist.  

Methane scrubbing Solar powered polar bear windfarm zoos  an invention for the new year  gets quadruple tax credits and is thus profitable by 2 cents per year of use.   But onhly if you factor in the payback back  the upfront cost is tremendous and the break even point occurs in year 3000.  

-Ah starting to sweat although I am lying on the floor  and just knocked the cup over and had to adjust things and the smell of my feces is wafting to my nose although it shouldn't be that strong anywhere near me  hi mom  try again  I know you will  dribbling sweat onto my makeswift pillow-  19:13 Est 1/3/08  after or actually while thinking up the blurb above  had the intense need to urinate  held it till finish  but then couldn;t hold it in bathroom  completely until getting to the toilet  and also got the intense need to defecate  not much urination or defecation in the end  left my room quick  usually bring something to work on  a book  writing something in the bathroom  after urinating but before defecating I turn around to find mother climbing the stairs at 18:55 Est to shut the window shades  she usually does that 21:000 or 20:00 she is early and was trying to block me in the bathroom without anything to do so I chose to let thing be partially out in back put my pants back on and run to my bathroom and she was eyeing and checking it out  I can tell monday and if I choose the trek to the post office I cannot avoid could be fun.  They want revenge and I will be vulnerable then.  Unless someone blocks them  theystill hope that they can get under my skin enough to make me want suiciide or to flee or attack them  I remember a prison guard who an inmate dinged a certain way and he went under and committed suicide.   It's like that-  they know with most people there is a limit  a point past which they can't endure- they are hoping to find mine.   A blind search of force now-  it is not one event it is a constant barrage  more in many ways than the past-  wanted to add more  but not sure there was one thought  specific thoguht  one thing they do try suicide and thoughts of fleeing and thoughts of anger  injecting those and see how far they go  I had a few  one 20 minutes ago  right after getting here and thinking can't I do it to her  ooh like a prickle in the air  room shoke  not an earth tremor  odd  but can't I focus on her like she focuses me and sit up here and while she is in bed cause  her body to be wracked pain  as she would do to me  she can't do fully that  she plays with my bladder and rectum and sometimes pain and sometimes forcing me awake-  something I did to the room has allowed sleep  I don;t know  I had good sleep the last couple nights  she doesn't want that to be  maybe a little becasue it is new year's and my normal demons are out partying  gremlins I should say are out partying and are not attacking me like they do  coughed as I started that thought on the gremlins partying.   -  but god tells me I shouldn't try something like that.   I for now agree.   It is like being locked in a cage with a demon.   Or perhap a mind flayer is a more appropriate reference.  - i did rearrange my room today and sge peeked in  why does that help  is their some way to better fight her  should i rearanged my books and furniture before bed  could I effectively lbock them from hurting me at night if I did? - I know you probably know answers  she is not stronger  but she has direct visual and auditory access to me  and tries to use that to beat you  - if I knew what to do  could I fight her better  I get it that you don't want to sue technique  because that can be copied- but just putting up with it all  it drives them crazy  because they believe in dominating and if you refuse to let them domiunate you  - . . . . . .  

I was going to mention  Travolta lost his son  did he intend for me to die in the bathroom in a similar way to his son  did scientology try that? - Tom Cruise  last week -  the CIA has appeared many times recently in ads  which is new  or the increased frequency is new-  and it used to mean every time a death threat against me  and generally with them  it appears  if you attempt to kill someone under their protection  the attempt fails and someone you care aobut suffers a similar fate that you intended for your victim  it is a decent deterrant-  though in my case the attempts have not stopped. 

I'm finally getting  rubbing right edge of lips with right thubma nd burping  I am finally getting that the reason Pittsburgh  hates creativity and hates people who do things differently is not that necessariyl it wants to stop innovation  it just wants full control  like they don't really think the invention  they just don't want the invention because it stops them from controlling if there is another way around them  -it's not fully the intvention they hate  it's the loss of contorl  and they are too shortsighted to see beyond control  they want to box up your options so they can better control what you do  it's not really a moral objection as much as they hide it in that-  it is an objection that they can't control when they  want to  bubonic plague time.

 FOX superscout of the boy scouts who is apparently jewish (here was a last name of a relative given)  and was name dropping Warren Buffet and real estate - we get to pick who shines - in which I will reject my home country and file for political asylum in another one  if this is your answer to me 17:48 EST 1/3/09  you're right I will tire eventually of the arguing game of why I have to keep pleeding for some semblance of justice and I know Obama feels he is going to use my past statements or something to force into jail or a mental institution and  IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE -  I may soon need diplomatic protection from my president from foreign government  swiss used to pass out citizenship to jews in Nazi germany-  I may need something similar.   I wanted something else down but it is forgotten  there were 5 ammendments broken  and its going to get shoved under the carpet -  he said in the interivew the sky is the limit you can be anything you want  and he  just the fact of scouting  which my parents kept me away from  the whole interview was a stab at me  so be it  and the same  this is rude  one of the reporters was the one with the former Israeli ambassador who was not in my opinion  overly diplomatic  no even more than that- or I wanted to say more than that -mother is trying to block it and it is almost tipping back  I will tire and leave this coutnry in time  AH  she was trying to block I got it- I am beginning to think after everything the government has allowed to occurr to me-  perhaps I owe it a challenge  by forcing its hand  if it wants me so much  than I will purposely disqualify myself from the presidency by becoming a foreign citizen so that the only way I could ever run for certain offices is if there were a constitutional ammendment which there should be anyway because the native born thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   I really should be the one planning my own future  and no one has made a convincing argument to the contrary.   I do not like the gaming and there is gaming  there is some need-  but they are hiding behind part of that it appears to get what they want.  And I'm not sure I want that.  I don;t want to make their job overly difficult, but I dont; want to be used either  I don't like he pushed into hero thing  it hasn't worked in the past.   I can mess up bad.  Too many people are enamored with that.  - maybe if I immigrated back you could change my name.  - Give me a new social security number  etc.

the only way I can see HAMAS being less popular is if the Palestinian authority is successful with it's territories and HAMAS appears to have squandered the future of the people  Gaza resembles Darfur including hostilities with the state near it  it's not a perfect resemblance but it is there  Darfur is not a stable situation and without some shift in politics or demographics  shift in demographics bluntly meaning the population changes its face  without one of those  there will not be peace in that region.  The hatred is too strong.   There is a reason HAMAS wins over the PLO- the situation will be interesting to see in 4 months-  or later  with respect if you have a way to make this anymore than a temprorary victory, you are very creative.   By achieving temporary peace the hatred wil foment  even if well-intentioned  no people likes having their government toppled at the will of their neighbor.  Would any of them trade living spaces to somewhere else.  - There is one place  integrate the population.  - And how accurate is Bush's picture? - That HAMAS is fully to blame  integration of the wrong sort will be perceived as trying to further destroy Palestine.   - Israel's moves so far will acheive a temporary lull - it will be very difficult to one destroy all HAMAS arms and two prevent HAMS from rearming though I may be wrong on that it depends what they do  but I would think that their actions currently only set up the conditions for a new cycle of violence  unless they add something else.  Again I want to see the situation 3-4 months from now. 

oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly  she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs  I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces  there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes  to rpevent issues-  have to look  of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep  that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com  amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on  the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up  by USPS from home  well this was going to amazon  same place  but I got a no  and I know the other reason why  if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something  of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender  so that eliminates that  what else was I thinking  they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure  it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem  but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com  ah  I wanted to say earlier  the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder  EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT  WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk  that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office  the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself  which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up  you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will  but you shouldn't of and  it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen  especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to  i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary  but we didn't want you to do things the way you were  we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE  SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY  MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED  SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking  and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else  just like bank of america  and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US  that is what is wanted  what I think Barack Obama intends to induce  get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt  while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier  but that is it  it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people  and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs  which isn't all that heavy  it's a rural route  not as rural as could be  but it isn't the city  it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules  I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well  and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine  that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again  putting her pen through it  it was weird  and she was one of theirs  that was the one where when I reported a missing package later  that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me  not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over  just implying it  came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast  there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad petty - on youtube  justify my love  like a virgin  Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned  that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example  you'd pull most of your videos  or at least some of the ones I know best  for a material girl  which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority  it's an intersting argument to make  very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09  I did want to add for some  those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand  not all of them are the songs I like hte best  audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes  but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open  there si a reason I don't come out in the open  in fact  all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution  I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it  there is sort of this american  it's best if you don't ahve to hide  we want to see you  BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it  and you are kind of forcing me out into the open  and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result  and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes  yes it would be better in time  it isn't right now  for many reasons people cannot handle it  I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas  not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out  it may ahve been the only way  as I stated a few months ago  so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding  but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful  my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden  but you forced it  and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way  I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done  I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it  I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative  itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone  that may not be possible  but  I am worried that you are a planning a surprise  I don;t want antoher surprise  there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, Give You Hell
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects Give You Hell and We Didin't Start the Fire Billy Joel  Madonna  whether I like her or not  Just Like a Prayer  Move Along All Aermican Rejects - - It Ends Tonight All American Rejects  the Wendy's commercial - Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show - in fairness Madonna can do it in others  she can also hide a message in hers  the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it  like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture  for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to  I will a music video  the right one  not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times  until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them  teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing  butyet a music video many things go  the well done ones  I named them up top  or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish  EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy  the backround isn't wasted  the facial expressions aren't wasted  everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society  billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes  to some degree  but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation  a pop up window came up on the abou of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that  where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  because you would have utter choas - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se  but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not  they do convey messages  but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it  the groupings  I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all  have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe  itching my right knee with right fingers wildly  stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video  but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe  organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements  as I element teaching jobs  it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to make it cool - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them  the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.

Odd breathing  sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name  though one's married name  she kept her own name  but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me  even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor  what are you doing here?  I might ask ou the same question. 

I don't want  French  no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher  not language  French american  and there weren't many if any French American sudents  both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence  one from France  one in high school and one in CMU  music in elementary school  then 5th grade or 6th she was both years  I am skipping one there  I can't find something he did  things happened around him and were trigered by other children  one time  I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities  but 4 out of the 5 seemed  odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen  and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong  and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course  my failure was planned  and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  You can do this with every group - that's just it  no, I can't  it doesn't work with Indian professors  it doesn't work Italians  there are individual  but not 80% - 20% if that  I don't think it works with the Irish  there were some bad experiences  but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est  mother came up starting questioning me through the door  throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus  she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet  though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though  about how dangerous it is  though someone will try to make her seem right  she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with move along the song  but used by nice productions  you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong  passed gas as I started writing this  et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps  they don't like it  8:39 EST 1/3/09  don't ahve to take a trip to the post office  can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county  he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here  Dupage  no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't  next county over  it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that  have  my mind combine two names  so I can't see  it's partly familar and partly wrong  rubbed right side of face with right middle finger  well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to  but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents  being asked to eat the leftovers  twice in my life  once by the  where did he live northwest chicago  but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh  but he took the metro in  not metro  metra as they are two different systems in Chicago   I visited there in 2004- the office is gone  but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do  it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004  someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin  container  deep or potato something  again it seemed out of place  polish   at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003  a woman  night shift  but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german  it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean  I do not know what to think on Milan  he was a nexus  saw him twice  he got me out of chicago or his wife did  but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me  he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh  had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire  as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have  and I guess- like he released me  he manueverd my anger and he did  it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time  rubbed left ear with left middle finger  they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people  by race  and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh  I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town  Pittsburgh is a town in many ways  it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't  there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go  I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much  I did drive down to see him in Southwest  I jsut didn't park too well as usual  cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say  about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention  the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully managed by other groups in the coutnry  yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU  she probably helped a great deal  was I a test for Pittsburgh  it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon  whatever  was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution  there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted  it is true that one was voluntary  but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand  I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things  it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency  history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence  the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm  we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips  even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck  lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me  how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue  high school and elementary  2 instances each that I see  high school more  but 2 in elementary  and then Pittsburgh  the thread follows  in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person  but there were in elemenary and high  elemtary into junior  mother's election helper  she is running around now downstaits  I can't trace  Milan? - Chicago  I didn't know the names  the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral  I never suspected.  - 3  oh wow  3  so much of this country hated me  driveways and odd trades  a one time incident  just happened  left no mark  just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me  but people from farther away  it wasn't an accident  none of it was an accident as early as  pretty early  it wasn't accidental  children aren't fully innocent for very long  the same people in one case where one thing happened  they would appear later  much later college from elementary school  I don't know what happens to others  in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random  very few  cause you can trace the same few classmates involved  i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy  sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing  but these tests never seem to stop  and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel  Obama or someone else  I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me  it's just not right  you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy  I am not happy about that part of it  you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not  no  I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take  and it never ends  it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to  I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit  rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb  do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up  I am the best qualified to handle me  and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever  and they are jsut tests  you could have stopped it at any time  I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with  yes I could probably figure it out  I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by  I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like  we'
re still not satisfied  we want one more thing yet  there is a crisis  but . . . . . at the same  you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you  WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE  I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care  but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all  I will find soemthing  it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that  so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me  that is all  real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it  let me see it  let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop  see if I ever break  yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me  I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot  you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked  you could have fixed it a long time ago  is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever  I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better  I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never  but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going  who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me  but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides  you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious  but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out  to you it's a big deal  to me it is  they fight like hell because they don't want to lose  but they won't be killed if they do lose  they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose  they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything  but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it  you ahve to agree  you hoodwinked that part  because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE  DAM PUSHED  BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT  AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict  you didn't let me know until today  who was the agressor  it seems like a test of me  how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling  I don't wnat a gandalf around me  this isn't the hobbit  but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can  and I will not know if you need them or not  but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to  much of the pressure could vanish on me  part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam  which has gone on for years  all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent  itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care  I was modelling my life  and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing  but I lost full control for a long time  and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year  I do not have freedom of even thought  you contorl what things I write ,read , and do  ne4ar totoal control  pushing me out of certain activities and into others  and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety  part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me  rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it  you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me  along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS  LET THEM BE  YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY  TURING  WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever  you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain  nor will there be  but now is bad.  - so be it.  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09  kfyo  that is a first

btw  trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem  you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009  DJI Average Dow Jones while up  the chart is bumpy  whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago  the US chart still has zig-zags  smaller ones-  but they are there  and that means fun and games  arbitrage  zig zags help arbitrage  but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton  hi mom .

 however big you are  certain people are key and other are not  Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters  competition is weaker than invention  and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole  and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff  martians burning brain out that calculates  all threats  oh yippee joy -= more threats  ho hgo ho  dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Phoenix Jim  70  auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not  govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need  we don't need them  we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here  and try to sell at premium in US  and in other coutnries they actually compete  they could price different in other countries than in US  and with Nafta  not NAFTA WTO  mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently  so big 3  gouge US customers potentially  but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3  make a plan  but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code  they all rate their education  and he slipped in something softly while I was typing  car thing  they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten  see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller  H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war  no we don't  we probably could Create an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii  do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout  militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami  charity  dumping thousands of shoes  I need shoes  sometimes  glue could be drying out  oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there  did someone figure that out  I didn't want to mention that  there is a backup shoe  unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family  sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight  could not get up  amber alert  silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo  ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris  they are like poison pills  the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken  but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point  others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA  people want to go snowboarding anyway  risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can.

save money for a little while  this caller sounds almost pittsburgh  the diction on that  anybody who pays 0 taxes-  there are people who don't buy anyhting  - they pay no tax  yes so what the caller is trying to do is say my way of life will destroy everything  couldn't we just revise how taxes are collected -versus killing me off- if that is issue  I need a lot less services than people to because I don't own a home and it does reduce waste and not owning a car reduces use of gov't services so is it so unfair I pay little taxes-  the gov't power of Pittsburgh does not want to risk reducing size so it wanted o condition me against my will to spend more- but that is against the constitution and they overlook what is lost by taking hte attitude they have the right to condition me to spend more to float their gov't when they are losing people and city services aren't so necessary and perhaps they should cut jbos out of the city governmwent-  because they do have less people  and they try not to.   Tehy don;t want to hear later that will lead to more jobs- better o get rid of unproductive jobs- but Pittsburgh didn't work that way

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh  1/2/09
Zaron  Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh  may know host  are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords  switched parties  on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse  in US over teacher awards  Canada  Quebec  politics flipping parties  Vermont  is not Granholm that is MI  telegenic  granholm is telegenic  what comes of her mouth does scare me though  and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA  Ken  tried to catch me with many numbers  pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems  I did not get down the 20,000  I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score  so I got down the point  and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my member - first a sharp pain  when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears  the burning with a little pain  is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare  don't cure illnesses  want them to be chronic- a

I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing.

I am not sure arts funding is so bad an idea  get rid of picking whno gets funding  make a criteria  something like that-  don't pick artists to do artwork  I will look at it.

we're

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09  nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho  grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand  as I thought to wait  they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way  mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on  but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors  this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others  but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this  and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo  some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est  as soon as I tried to mail a second time  on yahoo mail. Hmmm  that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description  the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set  is  from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover)  well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12  I can't but though cuurently  I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high  considering other prices on other items

if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set

Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $35  that is spiked  it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for  can be $25 maybe $30  but $30 should be and not a players  handbook  I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release  someone is spiking this price  boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series .   The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price  these books are not baseball cards  this is very odd. 

Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $34 on new book  new is lower than a used

Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000)  low price  $3.15  - I own a copy of this now  but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for  the publicated dates are similar  not a decade apart- YET  the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other- 

Ravenloft is a horror series-  I just identified that as a no  no  BUT  the devil is in the details  a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well  like if someone wanted to caricature  oh a famous software CEO  I don;t know what is in 3.5  but it is spiked  and the gamma world I got -

Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)
8 Used & new from $23.49   -  I do own this one now  similar to the amazon price  shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back  most dungeons and dragons go down  copyright 1996-  there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes  BUT  there is a story in here  it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups  it turned a forest planet into a desert  that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out  not a long book  96 pages  I would expect $3 for this maybe $6  but given what other D &D supplements there are  this is gets targeted  the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things  additional spells and this and that  few creatures  but nothing several different books don't contian  other books  many ohte books contain similar things-  wizard's handbook is similar.  - The history is the only thing I didn't have. 

The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more  it appears -  Bil gates destroying gamma world books  ho ho ho  yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book  by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb  Jeff was with Gary Gygax  he has been there a while -  copyright 2000  192 pages or so  oh  the cover I got is there  but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon  the book is on amazon  just not with the cover I have  or that is there too  but as a backup picture  not the main one shown  there is a different cover shown -
Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback)  - low price of  $24.95  for the new book  the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens.  - I paid  $7.65 for mine on amazon on  12/16/08  plusa shipping -  but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -

things like that can happen  but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -

why are books important  shutting of messages  Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable  many parables and like with defilers nad preservers  there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want  BUT  it had a message  severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest  and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first  people in the US first-  it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -

The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing -  BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE  - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved  many of those have been worthwhile  there are messages in them -

SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES  INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES-  I AM A REASON TOO  BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL  KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION  WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS  GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE  STORIES  so that all moral conditioning is controlled-  nifty huh  the technology revolution in operation right here.  - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well.   There is a modicum of material.   Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this.  - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games.   - yawning as I am about to email  scratching back of head too  with right hand  and scratched scab with left by left side of nose.   9:25 EST 1/2/09. 





All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com
I don't know if it  rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this  it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing  but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something.   People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever  in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product  scumbag.   I think the short version won't do  I don;t know the products before I buy them.  I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5  there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something  $4.75 I think or $4.79  under $4  the next price is $18  on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong  I knew that  it was worth the risk  for that price  Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book  happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once  now  that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller  usually there wil lbe a bidding war.   Itching right thigh with right finers -  but in this case I ordered it-  I got the product  it looked great  but there was a lot of air in the box  huge box and not much inside  it was the Revised Edtion  box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms  Babylon 5  when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online  like I even found a site  the attic I think a premium role playing game seller-  who previewed the first five pages  there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games  just a one line review  how to tie things in  the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50  and it had two small books  each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it  BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT  - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box  normally when one orders an item on amazon  amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items-  pages missing  so a ruelbook missing would count like that  but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside  I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff -  BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON  YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION  VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT  BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT  YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH  IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9  WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES  WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-  WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME  PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN  THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE  AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU  FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH  WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS.   Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.  
But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms  no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide  I was hoping  against hope to find a few page book preview  and I did  but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it  because it wasn't what I fully wanted  it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was  BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part.  But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price  I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box  so I didn't feel so cheated-  but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs  I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide  Babylon 5  through amazon  and I wasn't initially planning to do that-  THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come  probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine  again the whoemver- government  will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time  or they come when something happens  but with the recent game too of  if it gets held and I didn't want it  then they want me to return it and get something else  so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund  actually cancel the order)  they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy  the other side flipped that on them  by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal  and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date  but in order to get me to return  like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy  the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take.   And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide  and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars.    Bit upper lip as I mentioned that.   So what happened  I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set.  Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly  this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end  movie references  there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5  I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller  that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted-  I had to go back to amazon to get info this time  no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time  but amazon had a page count ofor a box set  and I checked the page count of the item I ordered  against the pages I got and it is short a bit  I do not  I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed  which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon  where  they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes-  and it's your fault for not reading the note  that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes-  but it said in the notes it wasn't english  see you missed a detail  it's your fualt  versus  should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with?  -  Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference.  - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description  but he sold me a different item  that from the cover looked very similar  and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available.   And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick  of course  I get to rate him a second time as well.  - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale.    Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.   - I was putting more books in a box  and mother woke  up  the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again  because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in  they're all small boxes  and mother was up in a flash  like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books  which neatened things up a little  and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books.  I did throw one out several months back  but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.  But mother was up  here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell  german town where my fahter's family is from  we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII  and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me  and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car.  But we shall see  the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous  but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that.  She would have had to.   She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle  it would tag my computer-  she does that-  she had me order for christmas last year  this book she never read  a cartoony sort of physics  book which sat on our coffee table  she also has her own computer downstairs  she could look it up  she doens;t she asks me  I declined  she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance.   I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much -  I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me  when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out.   Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed  but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation  she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous  I mentioend that above  but saying it down here made mne catch the error above.  But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this  if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry-  I am trying to get prepared to deal with that.   You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time. 



wpht's audio stream links are working again  good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09

Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep  rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle.  The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too  and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day -  again we are taking the gives you hell from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you  not with just a we hate piece ot it. 

- education with levin  I did lose  -forgot what should go here  I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up  I do golf worse than the union memebers do.   At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think. 


businesses in CO suffered because of the mad bomber - let's get this straight  the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped-  but we get more money during the holidays  BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't  don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind  which is crazy.  It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays  it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is  harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business  why have a shot like that  we make more money-  but you do it for all the wrong reasons  and overall things would be better if it weren't done  less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well  and just bought when they wanted or needed something  through the year.  It works pretty well for me.   Versus  oh Christmas  gifts are good  gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people  because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same  most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no  I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me - stories  that is not the norm.

like if everything keeps  and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case  could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers  that might be itneresting? - they'd scream  we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is too big to fail - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering  though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job  but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me  they do lean on people not to do things and that is not legal  and like murders on buses  beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way.   Get more people to drive. 

the marines like move along from All American Rejects  I think although that one is good too  -my pick for explaining things would be Gives You Hell - one of these days we'll stop fighting  cause that is a central problem with a society  not picking one side over the other  but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST  - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending  he got it right  but society doesn't see that yet  they ot it right  bands are teams oo I guess. 

rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com.  Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09  16:10 maybe

Weaalth envy  listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation  shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth  the way he says it does reek of wealth envy  and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument  that people buy $500,000 parking spaces.    And indeed even in Colorado that seems like  someone set that up just to play with people-   And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value  too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods  that is true  weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything  the $500,000 NYC studio apartment  and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue  the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual value of each of those dollars  many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created  in truth  capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it  but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system  in short people cheat like anything on the market  and actually on several markets-  real estate is an issue.  Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping.  Or is only halted.   Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA  or does it go out of state  jsut a thought  west losing power  political power and financial power  even in CA  though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam.  But back to the first point-  I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws  you can only be so much wealthy  nor for  rubbed  right calf with left foot  coughed  passed gas  nor for  now I forget  I will get hat(that) one though  nor for  licked lips lower lip as I got it  nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy  I may think about that a bit-  not force  but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays)  do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point  not sure on that  a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities  for very little good reason  but I am not for telling a perosn  don;t be ostentatious  you have to live this way -   the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure  the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US  as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO  and the elites to control and fix that market  prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs  there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay-  and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism  more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it  TWO  get rid of one central head like that and focus one person  that thinking will change  is chaing  freeware  it's not one perosn  it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out  but it will  that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis  who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public.   But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class  that fixes nothing  the guy is basically telling them  you can do it-  jsut be secret  our society has too many secrets -  I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales  in this age  I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it  I think that could yet be perfected.   It is sort of agaisnt the idea of old capitlaism - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product  better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory. 

But wealthy envy is an issue  people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up  the military is a good candidate for unions  that is scary  speak the language of bread  uggghh  but not the language of doing but of complying  but they don't know well enough -  um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list  he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever  he tried to kill me  or had others do it for him  or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate  and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president-  which theoretically can't happen legally  and he will do something to me with the power he has  he won't play by the rules -  there was a book on Dragon empires in space  which was kept cheap  in order to  it looked like what I wanted  but it was designed to assuage me  the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama  and suggest it will not be the end of the USA-  I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line  mother's foot mvoed too  can hear it  so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom -    got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else-  touched right index finger to left thumb  rubbing right calf with left foot  the middle class and class envy  people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000  the waste bothers me some  but I do not desire their life  for it seems foolish  the price paid.   If more people were satisfied with what they  the wealth envy issue would go away-  moeny in most cases is not the issue  it is dissatisfaction with life-  and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand.    And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned  on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere  I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade-  sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this  the price was right  I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully  it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide  like I don't know  was i getting hlepd or hurt  it appeared that i was getting helped-  I got two used books for the price of a new one  and at times  beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way  But uncertain  and the door just bumped-  the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide-  the definiton of the planets is not so good-  we shall see-   because the review for that guide on amazon  mentioning what I bought in the end  prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it  it was lower priced  that immediately draws some suspicion  again  but it could be for two reasons  one good  one bad  they do both  and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked-  the first batch  on the second  they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see  though one did not go through without a fight  they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids-  like as a gorup  I guess I will find out as things come in  itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger.  1/1/09 15:49 EST

about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com  got my first  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I got to the mail page  for the new year  1/1/1/09 15:26 Est  joy oh rapture. 

1/1/09   


FOX  early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the the beauty of HI  the beauty of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me-  and I have to admit  when I went to HI  I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind  in addition  HI when I saw had bugs  there were none in the pictures  hmmm -  HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.   

On that note  Junea or Anchorage for state capital  sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute  as well as city officials -  AND  I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power  Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business  if it does  like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions  where  things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center  it won't give up the money or power  Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields  Itasca  than suburbs of Pittsburgh  - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes  my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money  and another near deletion occurred here-  seem to be doing a string of them  I never did them before-  that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it-  mother  I know gremlins can play with computers too  they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well.  - licking upper lip-  - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry  hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words  In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places  walmart and chicago mile  which is impossible without a car and  I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago.  Definitely not in Chicago  not even a walmart in Chicago  and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe  southwest  sam's in Evansville.  - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an oversight in their transit.  It was on the way to the airport.    Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger -  but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars  there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities -  $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado -  it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent  for the parking.   That is not a loop price.   And someone wants that revenue  versus having a stronger and better working transit system.   So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money.    - In my case people seem willing to kill over it.   Touching upper lip with tongue.  

popup window as I looked at notes  and left thumb on right foot's center  as I go to my notes
touching thumbs
for the last email  the full version 

cbs news  touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me  technically barter should be illegal as I noted before  not without using the monetary system  they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their friends while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system  you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency  it should be the equivalent of counterfeit  that is the essence of what it is  coughing as I put that up.  It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another  and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it-  BUT  they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money  we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless  maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early  bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive  I nearly deleted this section  the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error  and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared  and a hacker is probably behind that  deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen  perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price  that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed  - But not allow simply exchanges between friends -  and my door bumped again.  Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56  total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

100% Risk Free: Federal Government Reserve Account::

Calvary Greetings.

I work with a bank here in Uk as an accounts officer. I have just found out
that a foreign customer with A/C NO 122-0000-240 who deposited US$4.5 million
in an Natwest Croll Account in our bank died since July 2006 without leaving a
next of kin to his funds and he has no known family to claim his funds.

Since the bank will return the fund to Federal Government reserve account if it
remains unclaimed, and this will only favor the Government of Uk, I decided to
look for a foreigner that will inherit the funds while I prepare grounds for
the claim.

The claim itself is overdue and will be given prompt attention by the bank upon
request. If you partner with me I will give you 50% of the total amount
involved. I will give you exclusive details and support from here as an
accounts officer.

I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. I will furnish you with
more details upon your reply.

Further More please i would like you to please provide me with your personal
informations so as to enable us carry out this transactions with immdiate
effects.

I left the firm in 1997 after LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV retired at the age of 58. Since then I went on to open my soliciting firm in the United Kingdom and I have manage LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV funds, which was in the United Kingdom..


On the 11 of March 2004,it came to my notice that LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV was on vacation in Spain , he was going for sight seeing when he got on  the commuter train system of Madrid when series of coordinated bombings took place (a suicide bomber with a bag pack on train) in the Madrid commuter train exploded which killed over 191 people and injured a further 2050 and my dearest friend God bless his sole LATE MR VIKTOR BARKOV was caught in the incident I always remember when I spoke to him last on the 10th of that month and he told me how Spain was it took me over a year to get over it and come to reality that he was no more. Since then I have paid over £150,000 for the last 4 year to secure this funds I have been looking for any of his relatives since then and only to find out that he was the last generation of the BARKOV Family single and Died at the age of 65years.

Date: Tue, 6 Jan 2009 09:15:09 -0600
X-Folder: Junk E-Mail
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Sir/Ma'am
I have family in Qazah, elder women (my aunts 70 and 82 years old,  childern 5-16 years old , my cousins and their families.  My family been suffering from the tight israeli sanction for months and years. hunger, humilation, no water, no electricity, and now war.  please help in demanding cease fire now.

here is some information:

1) The Israeli strikes, which started on December 27th, come after several weeks of a tight Israeli blockade which left many of Gaza's 1.5-million inhabitants without sufficient food, water, fuel, or medicine.

2) As of December 30th, the United Nations indicates that the Israeli air strikes over the past three days have killed 375 people, including 63 civilians, in Gaza and have left over 1,650 more injured, almost 300 of which are in critical condition. The UN estimates that 5% of those killed are children under the age of 18.

3) The population of Gaza is 2/3 refugee and more than half are under the age of 16. The UN has listed Gaza as the most densely populated area in the world with a population density that is higher than that of Manhattan in New York City.

4) Israel has a responsibility as the occupying force under international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions, and the laws of war to avoid harm of civilians in Gaza.

5) Israel's actions with the tight blockade on the 1.5-million people in Gaza is a violation of those laws.

6) Israeli's attacks on Gaza, thus far resulting in the death of over 375 people, including over 62 women and children, and injuries to 1,650 more people, calls for an immediate investigation by the United Nations and objective review by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

7) The timing of the strikes calls into question Israel's political motivation as this comes in the final days of a lame-duck US Administration and one-month before a hotly-contested Israeli election in which the challenger is attacking the incumbent for being "soft" on security.

8) It is time for the US to take its proper role as an honest broker in the conflict and to live up to its promise as a champion of freedom, liberty, and justice.

9) An immediate cessation of hostilities on all sides and a complete end to the blockade is the only way to reinstate a cease-fire agreement that will ensure the security of both Israelis and Palestinians.

10) The mainstream media in the US has thus far miserably failed in its news coverage of the humanitarian tragedy taking place in Gaza. Media outlets should recall the disproportion, context of occupation, and siege when mentioning the indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas on southern Israel.

Situation before the strikes:

Cease-Fire from June to December: During the cease-fire brokered by Egypt in June 2008, rocket attacks by Hamas extremists had greatly diminished. The blockade of Gaza was relaxed slightly by Israel; however, it never ended completely.

November: Israel escalated the situation in early November by killing 4 Palestinians in Gaza; claiming they were involved in weapons smuggling, in the bloodiest violation of the cease-fire during the Egyptian-brokered agreement. This resulted in renewed rocket attacks by Hamas thus resulting in the crippling tight blockade by Israel on the 1.5-million people in Gaza.

December: The siege of Gaza continued to suffocate the population with renewed Hamas rocket attacks against southern Israel.

Impact of these strikes on the security of Israel:

The disproportionate nature of the Israeli strikes furthers the humanitarian disaster, and represents a collective punishment of the population of Gaza, which will not likely lead to security for Israelis. Multiple studies indicate that similar attacks in the past have failed to make Israeli citizens any safer and resulted in increased support of Hamas extremists.

Final Thought:

Throughout the history of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations only cease-fires and agreements have brought peace and security for both Arabs and Israelis.

                               STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


Attn.:Sir/Madam,

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mrs Gladys Declark, the wife of Mr. Philip Declark, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.

 I got your contact on South African trade journal, and decided to write you. Before  the death of my  husband, he had taken me to South African for annual  year holi day  in (2002) During our holiday he deposited the sum of  US$7.500,000,00. (Seven Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), in one of  the private security  companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in  Zimbabwe.

This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company, This amount was meant for The purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and Establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my husband was One of the victims, It is  against this background that, I and my children who  are currently staying in South African decided to transfer my husband money to any  country since the law  of South African prohibits refugees from opening any bank  account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the  territorial zones of  South Africa, As the first wife of my husband, I am  saddled with the  responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account  where this money could  be transferred into without the knowledge of my  government who are b ent on  taking everything.

All I seek for is an honest businessman/woman, whom I can entrust my Future and that of my family I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to South African, so that you can help me open a non-resident account in your name in any commercial bank here in South Africa which will aid us in transferring the m oney into any account you will nominate overseas.
This money I intend to use for investment and growth in your country.

I have two options for you; firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this Transaction or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your Country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might insure in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing To give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will remain for I and my family.

If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with the above Telephone: +27 83-472-2059 and e-mail addresses: <mailto:mrsdeclark@hotmail.com>mrsdeclark@hotmail.com, or <mailto:madamdeclark01@yahoo.co.uk>madamdeclark01@yahoo.co.uk

Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as possible, I'm in Dire need to leave this country soonest.

Thanks for your mutual co-operation.I expect your soonest response.

Best Regards,

Mrs Gladys Declark

Dear Friend ,




I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, but as things unfold,we will know each other better. I will start by introducing myself to you.My name is Thomas Cole a solicitor at law.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as his next of kin so I have contacted you to assist in repatriating most especially, the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where the huge deposits were lodged.




Particularly, the Equity Development Bank Plc where the deceased had an account valued at about Usd28.5 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the Next of kin, or have the account confiscated.




I seek your consent to present you as the Next of kin of the deceased,I need somebody who is trustworthy and willing to assist me get the funds transfered.Whcih the account which my late client operate is valued at Usd28.5 million dollars can be paid to you, as my clients Next of Kin, and then we can share the amount on a mutual agreed percentage.




All legal documents to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be provided. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law and you should endeavor to keep it confidential.

Email: barri_morgan_smith333@hotmail.com

Please kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you I believe you are a highly respected personality considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events.

Well, I am Barrister Morgan Smith, a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr ANDREAS SCHRANNER Who Died With all his Family in a Plane Crash in the month of July 2000.
See the Weblink for details: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my client's relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client in a Bank in bangkok thailand, Particularly, the Bank where the deceased deposited the US$25 Million (twenty five Million United States Dollars only).

Consequently, the Bank issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin to claim the US$25 Million (twenty five Million United States Dollars only) in their custody within the next twenty official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 7 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased to claim the fund as the Next of Kin to him so that the fund will be transferred to your account by the Bank.

Upon receipt of the fund, I will come over to your country to meet with you for the disbursement of the fund and then you and I will share the money in this order: 60% will be for me, 40% will be for you. I have all the necessary legal documents that can back our claim we will make with the Bank.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
kindly send me the following information

1. FULL NAME:
2. COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:
3. PRESENT ADDRESS:
4. DATE OF BIRTH:
5. OCCUPATION:
6. TELEPHONE NUMBER:
6. FAX NUMBER:
7. MARITAL STATUS:


upon receipt of this information, We will forward them to the Bank with a power of attorney from court presenting you as the next of kin, and as such the beneficiary of the fund.
You are needed as a next of kin to inherit the late deceased left fund For more information, please kindly contact me through my email above to enables us discuss further.

Best regards .

I would like to meet with the governor to discuss what funding is available as I would like to use existing properties to house the homeless and feed the hungry. I strongly feel this is an issue that has to be better addressed and I would be willing to head this issue and receive no compensation for my efforts. I just need to know how to get this heard and gain funds from the local, state, or federal government. I know we all want to believe their are enough shelters out there but that is certainly not true. During Christmas I personally fed 3500 seniors in our area.

If you are having difficulties in paying for your medications, a number of drug manufacturers have developed assistance programs to help those who cannot afford the products they market. If you qualify, it may be possible for you to get some of your medications at no charge through your physician courtesy of the drug manufacturer. If you are interested in pursuing this matter further, then I would ask that you contact the GuilMED at 336-641-8030 and request information on the Medication Assistance Program.

I hope you find this information helpful.

Governor Easley,
I recently lost my job due to an illness. I was out of work, and they fired me because I missed too much time. That was on Dec. 16th. I applied for unemployment. Of course because I was fired I was not guaranteed unemployment. When I contacted the local Greensboro branch of the ESC they told me it could take 4-6 weeks before I had a decision on my unemployment. When I contacted the Raleigh office they told me it could take 10 weeks before I had a decision. I am not married, and I do not have any family that can help me financially. I had a decent job and I was able to pay my bills. No one is hiring right now, and I do not have savings. What am I supposed to do in the 4-10 weeks it takes for them to make a decision about whether I deserve unemployment? How am I supposed to pay my rent or utilities? I have worked since I was 15, and I am 27 now. I have paid taxes for 12 years, and now when I need my tax dollars to help me, I cannot get them. By the time they even make a decision on my unemployment I am going to be homeless. I need help or a suggestion. I have applied for food stamps, and am waiting on a decision but that can take up to 30 days. The department of social services will not help with my electric because I do not have a minor child living with me. What am I supposed to do? Where are the programs to help me that my tax dollars have gone to support for the last 12 years? Please feel free to call me or email me with any suggestions? Thank you in advance for your time. Amie L Hodges

	Press Release
	Office of Political Affairs



	While fighting Hamas in the effort to safeguard the citizens of Israel, humanitarian supplies have been allowed to enter Gaza to address the crisis and shortages created by Hamas and its operatives in the territory.  To view more images of the humanitarian aid movement, please visit <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0011RHVcUU5i-3-IO9zhqBBHOeoiL55Az2_0OjL5vasgPjjJ7rW3puks4KfOGPRF5MnnI7Qd-tmt0HwsRQ78jyvrLuicKUNaA9nhOK2yRxX7PE=>Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/D7DAB8A4-89B1-432B-B400-02949F816D3D/0/idfkeremshalomjan2.jpg><http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/EBC646F3-C6EB-4EDC-B19B-D04563392D0B/0/idfhumansm.gif><http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/8E23D35F-7DB0-4E5D-AE4E-ABAAB96F47ED/0/idfhumaitarianjan6.jpg>

The Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast has been receiving statements in support of Israel from our region's elected officials.  See below for some comments of the South's Senators and House Representatives:

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA)
"Since 1948 and the creation of the nation of Israel, it has been and remains one of the greatest and strongest strategic allies and partners of the United States. Our countries have worked closely together in the areas of national security, economic development, and trade.

Israel is an important foundation of stability and democracy in the Middle East. The resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is important not only to the peace and security of the Middle East, but also to the rest of the world.

The United States and Israel share common principles including the strong commitment to eradicate terrorism and secure a better future for the world. Israel has been a steadfast ally of the United States, and I assure you, the U.S. stands ready to assist our friends, the Israelis, to promote peace and defeat terrorism.

Following years where terror groups in Gaza launched rockets at Israel targeting the Israeli civilian population, it became clear it was time for action. After Hamas failed to renew its self imposed cease-fire--one it had never enforced fully--Israel was forced to take appropriate action to protect her citizens.

The United States supports Israel or any nation that is responding to attacks in self defense on its country and its citizens. I do hope that this conflict soon will come to a peaceful conclusion.

Nevertheless, and let me be clear, Israel has every right to defend its citizens while taking necessary precautions to spare the civilian population in Gaza and reduce collateral damage."

Senator Bob Corker (R-TN)
FROM ABC'S MEET THE PRESS, DEC 28, 2008
"...So far, certainly all of us -- our hearts and prayers go out to people on both sides, and certainly especially the civilians who have been harmed in the Gaza area.  But mostly, [the military response has] been confined to people who are part of the security forces for Hamas, and certainly all of us want to see an end to this conflict and some long-term peace settlement actually occur there..."

Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC)
"I'm deeply troubled by the recent rocket and mortar attacks on Israel launched by Hamas. No one should have to live in constant fear and no sovereign nation can stand by while their citizens are attacked daily by terrorists.

Years ago, Israel controlled Gaza and surrendered authority over the area in order to broker a better peace. In exchange, Israel has patiently waited for Hamas to renounce its violent ways, act responsibly, recognize Israel's right to exist, and come to the negotiating table. However, it is clear Hamas has no intention of living peacefully with Israel. With an unwillingness to move forward, Israel has every right to take the necessary steps to protect and defend its citizens and target those who preach hate and violence.

Israelis and Palestinians both deserve to live in peace, and I have always hoped a safe and secure Israel could live side by side with a sovereign and peaceful Palestine. Through their actions, members of Hamas have made it clear the organization is nothing more than a mouth piece and aggressive arm of the Iranians that cannot act independently for the benefit of the Palestinian people. Hamas must renounce violence and act as an honest broker. If it does not, it will be the responsibility of every nation in the Middle East to shut down the long supply lines of rockets, bullets and bombs that run from Iran to Hamas in Gaza."

Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)                                                                         
"In some reports that you see on television or you read about in the papers, you would think Israel's actions were unprovoked and unnecessary. The opposite is true. Israel has been provoked for 15 months by Hamas in Gaza, and Israelis have finally drawn a line in the sand and moved in to try to protect the best interest of their citizens," Isakson said. "As long as Hamas is unwilling to enter into a meaningful peace agreement that can be trusted and verified and make a meaningful effort to stop the terror, then Israel is doing precisely what it should be doing in the best interest of its people. It is doing no less than we in this United States Congress and America would do were we attacked in the same way."

Rep. Tom Price (R-GA)
"The restraint exercised by Israel prior to the current conflict was remarkable.  The defense of sovereignty ultimately dictated action," said Rep. Price. "Hamas must not be allowed to perpetuate a violent open-ended threat to the Israeli people.  Like all those who stand for peace and democracy, I urge the leadership from Israel, Palestine, and all nations to work for a responsible and peaceful resolution. Especially during this time of transition in our nation, we must ensure the United States does not waiver in our support of democracy in all parts of the world."

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL)
"We must all remember that all free and democratic nations across the world are engaged in a war on terrorism. Hamas is no different than Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah or any other ruthless terrorist organization. It seeks to terrorize free people by killing and traumatizing innocents. Israel is fighting a terrorist group that is relentlessly attacking its people, and for Israel to do anything less than fully defending itself militarily would be completely irresponsible. Inaction could cause long-term detrimental implications to Israel's security in the region. I wholeheartedly support Israel's right to self defense and its efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorist and rocket launching sites in the Gaza strip through their military offensive. I urge the United Nations and our European counterparts to do the same."

Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC)
"This troubling situation in Gaza is yet another reminder of the dangerous circumstances the people of Israel face while Hamas continues to kill innocent civilians through indiscriminate rocket attacks. Israel has not only the right but the obligation to protect its citizenry, and I hope the international community will recognize and support their acts of self-defense."
