Kelley,
I believe this is just a legislative issue that she has.  She is making suggestions on changing the law and her husband is not currently eligible to apply for a pardon.

The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; “It takes all of us to make it work.”



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article “That’s an order”.” Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.”



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and can’t seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor I’m attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

David, this e-mail came to the Governor's Office and Kelley forwarded it to me.  My inclination is to respond that the matters mentioned in the e-mail are within the courts system, over which the Governor has no authority, and also involve changing laws, for which their legislator needs to be contacted.

Let us know what you think.

Thanks.
Allison

It’s not county. It’s Administrative Office of the Courts. They are not subject to the State Personnel Act. If what she wants is a job, I can send her a reply about that. If what she wants is to complain about her former supervisor, it needs to go to AOC. Your call.

We cover 8 counties in the cental coastal plain including the counties of Beaufort, Carteret, Craven, Jones, Lenoir, Onslow, Pamlico, and Pitt. We have a desperate need for high speed internet service in these counties. With the increased use of e-mail communication, the Divisions use of Beacon, starting back in April and the begining of the new year launching a new fire report program that also requires the use of internet. With our budgets being very tight we could not afford internet service through OITS. We have tried to use aircards in some of our counties and this has worked with some success. We do have a few that, due to their location, does not get acceptable service. The cost for internet service through OITS is about $280 per month, with a total of over $3,000 per year. All of our counties are in a cooperative agreement with the local county governments and get a portion of their opperating money from these counties. With the economy the way it is and the budgets the way they are we feel that $280 per month is a little bit much. Is there anyway possible to get internet service at a cheaper rate for our county headquarters? At the present time we have one county, Beaufort, that is using OITS internet service. Anything you could offer will be greately appreciated....Thanks

Hi Justin,

The name of the new venture is Environmental Carolinas.  We’re launching it this month.



It’s pro-business, uses web-enabled technology, and is based on NC Department of Environment and natural Resources (DNR) recommendations (as well as EPA, Energy Star and SC Dept of Health).  I’ve attached a draft of a summary sheet for your review. 



The concept is new and exciting (like Bev Perdue!), and I’m hoping that Governor Perdue will find it very attractive.  It’s good for small businesses…for the environment…and for North Carolina.



I’m grateful for any help you can give in guiding me to the right people on this initiative.  I’m not looking for funding the project.  I’m looking for the widest audience to expose the new venture.



Thanks Justin.

I want to wish you and your family a healthy and happy holiday season and
thank you for your friendship and support during the past year!

        During the holidays I hope you will join me in thinking about two
things.  First is family - like many of you, my family and I will cherish
this time together.

        Second is our state - like the rest of the nation we have endured
some tough times of late, but I know we will work together to get things
back on track in 2009 in our country and in our state.

        I hope you will join me in wishing the people of North Carolina a
happy, peaceful holiday and a wonderful New Year.

        Happy Holidays!

Dear Beverly,
Our daughter, Alex was recently deferred at UNC-Chapel Hill.  I realize that you have many obligations to fulfill but I am hoping that you can find the time to submit a letter to  Stephen Farmer on her behalf.  Alex is a vivacious, conscientious, athletic, energetic young lady.  She will be an asset to whatever university she attends next year.  I am attaching a copy of her resume for you to attain an impression of her and her achievements.  She enjoyed her successful participation in the Honors English class offered by the NC Virtual Public School last year.  I understand that was one of the programs that you have championed in the past,  so you have had a personal impact on her education. 
My mother-in-law, Eileen Cella, is sending you a letter by mail, but I wanted to contact you to let you know her letter is forthcoming and to make my own plea on Alex's behalf.  We are certainly proud of our neighbor the governor!  Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do for us and for eastern North Carolina! We will certainly understand if the demands of your office do not allow you to help us in this cause.  If you do feel that you can be of  assistance, the required contact information is below.  Thank you for your kind consideration.  Sincerely,
Bridget Cella

Kelley,
He asks this question -  "Are there any laws that might soon give a felon a second chance? Especially those that haven't committed any crimes in years and it having been their first offense. This was my first and only felony offense."
Wouldn't that be a legislative issue?

> Hi Bev Perdue,
> 
> I'll be quite frank with you Bev, when I was younger, 20, I was quite naive. I never thought that one mistake could endure the rest of my days. I was about 20 years old, and I was living with my mother, a registered nurse in Carolina Beach. The only thing I enjoyed was having fun and partying with my friends. I never thought about the future because I thought I could put it off until later. Well the sad thing is my mother kicked me out of her house. She set me up in a little apartment on Carolina Beach. Well one night I was trying to sleep so I could wake up to go look for a job so I could survive on my own when Tim Reid, Angela Reid, and Robert Pridgeon showed up unexpectedly and asked me to help them with a wicked plot. Tim wanted to kill his parents because he didn't want to go to prison for forging their checks. Although at the time I thought life hopeless I wasn't crazy enough to engage in the plot. I was young and naive at the time, but I did the right thing. I told them that I wouldn't help. As they were all leaving Bobby Pridgen took my car keys from the coffee table and said they were taking my car.
> 
> Sure enough I didn't want them taking my car, so I acted like I was going along with it. As a result, being the fool that I was, I ended up driving them to the Reids' house. Tim broke into the house once there, and I started trying to talk them out of it. In the end, I ran out of the house and hopped in my car after the dog started barking, and the others followed. To make a long story short, we were caught driving out of the Pine Valley housing section. As a result, I ended up believing a court appointed lawyer, and thinking that I should plead guilty to the crime. In court I stood up and said that I didn't intend to kill the Reids'. After having signed the plea bargain waiver for an old-law 10 year sentence, I served a 10 year sentence in about 4 years. To be honest one of the main factors in my signing it was the drive to get out of the county jail.
> 
> Sadly enough, in the current digital age I might as well have the word 'Felon' stamped to my head. Since I was released in 1998 I obtained a 2 year degree in computer engineering and a 4 year degree in information systems. I'm also doing pretty well considering that I'm monitoring the operations of a call center that houses about 400 Internet technicians. Most importantly, I'm staying out of trouble (the worst trouble I've been in was getting speeding and a seat belt tickets).

Working with the court system seems impossible considering that all of the elements needed to withdraw a plea seem to be waived in the plea agreement. It seems to me that it should be due process for a judge to throw out a plea given that conspiracy to commit murder requires 'intent' of the defendent to commit the crime and that obviously I didn't really understand the nature of the offense that I was pleading to or I wouldn't have been saying I didn't intend to kill the Reids' while I was pleading guilty. Are there any laws that might soon give a felon a second chance? Especially those that haven't committed any crimes in years and it having been their first offense. This was my first and only felony offense.

Subject: NC Wildlife Resources Commission proposed hunting changes



The Honorable Governor of NC, Bev Perdue;

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission has proposed very significant and almost certainly damaging changes to the hunting season. The vast majority of the hunters in NC are opposed to these hunting regulation changes proposed by the NCWRC. I attended a hearing in Morganton, NC and the auditorium was packed. Many, many hunters spoke out against the proposed extended gun season. David Cobb, Division Chief, was reported to have stated recently at another hearing that over 13,000 comments have been made which is more than he has ever seen in his time with the Commission. He further stated that his perception is that there is a majority of people who are in opposition. This opposition is occurring all over the state.


Dr. Craig A. Harper, who is a professor in the Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries Department at the University of Tennessee, spoke at the Morganton hearing in opposition. Dr. Harper is nationally recognized in quality deer management and has published many papers on such. Dr. Harper stated that there is no biological reason to try to establish one common deer season across the diverse state of NC. In fact there are many valid reasons to not have a common season statewide. I have attached a copy of an open letter from Dr. Harper on this issue. The deer population, weather, people, food sources, growing season, etc in the mountains, the piedmont and coastal plains are all considerably different. One size does not fit all and makes no biological sense. The Commission's deer density map on their own website supports our claim.  The same is true for the Commission's turkey season proposed changes. It is so glaringly apparent that these proposed changes are so ! seriously flawed that virtually everyone at these hearing, including the NCWRC biologist staff, understand it.


In the July, 2006 minutes of the Deer Committee meeting of the NCWRC, the minutes state that "In fact, discussion during the Deer Committee revealed that there is more support for decreasing the length of the all-lawful-weapons season in the Central Deer Season area" instead of these proposed increases in the season. In a later meeting of the Deer Committee in April, 2007 a hunter survey by the NCWRC with 5,005 hunter responses was presented to the committee. In these meeting minutes the "Committee felt that it would not be prudent to increase the length of the all-lawful-weapons season in any season area..."  And "Comments were made as to why this issue is being revisited again, and concerns were raised that our staff were being asked to evaluate and possibly propose a regulation proposal for which there is little to no support for at the field level." We are at a loss to understand why the Commissioners are trying to shove these changes th! rough when no staff biologists support it. Where are the studies and surveys that support their positions? Yet the NCWRC is still proposing to make these hunting regulation changes.  The Commission is not listening to the proven science of wildlife biology from their own biologists, outside biologists nor to the hunters of North Carolina. If the Commissioners ignore the science of wildlife biology our wildlife and hunting will suffer greatly.


There are many other significant detriments of this extended deer gun season if passed, such as bear hunters (who primarily use dogs) and deer hunters being in the woods at the same time and bird hunters effectively getting reduced hunting. The bear/deer issue in particular will create conflicts and animosity again as it did years ago when the seasons overlapped.


This is a very serious issue and will damage the fragile deer and turkey population in the central and western parts of our state where some hunters have just started quality deer management practices to improve the numbers and quality of deer. We don't have hunters from other states traveling to NC to hunt deer like the Midwest and other states. Why? Because our deer herds are not in good shape and don't produce many big, mature bucks.


The majority of NC hunters oppose this seriously flawed proposal. If the Wildlife Commission wants to promote wildlife in NC then they should propose changes to encourage and promote quality wildlife management programs that work. I hope you will join us in opposing these damaging hunting regulation proposals and will work to see they are NOT passed by the NCWRC.


Respectfully,

Brian Heath

Hi,

Since Mr. Todd filed a tort claim, this is a legal matter with the NCDOT as the defendant and the Attorney General's office handling the case. Per Department policy, we can't have any correspondence with him from our office while the legal process is under way.

As an FYI, it can sometimes be months before a ruling is issued on a claim. Mr. Todd could find out more about the process by contacting the Industial Commission at (919) 807-2500.

Visitor: Mr. Johnny Todd

Address: 18009 G Kings Point Drive,  Cornelius, NC  28031

Email: jtodd13@mi-connection.com

Subject: road debri / car damage

Comment: I'm in a logjam with the NCDOT who is per their web site page under Maintenance responsible for road debri removal. I incidently struck road debri on a NC highway in a Work Zone. This debri not removed cost me 150.00 in tow fees and a 250.00 insurance deductable fee. The insurance company I have took care of the 2800.00 plus bill. I have filed claims and now a TORT Claim T-1. Please advise me as to what to do to get this negligent act on the NCDOT sub contractor who is responsible for debri removal paid. I pay insurance to get me car repaired and I'm sure NCDOT pays insurance to keep road ways clear. See Todd vs. NC Dept of Transportation file # 08-1969. Your help or direction in this matter is appreciated. Iredell County I77S @ mile marker 31 jtodd 704 763 3850

Dear Madame Governor,

    I am sure you are aware, that to make lasting changes within the Mental Health Facilities and Nursing Homes in our state, there will need to be more than a tour yearly to check up on things.  I would like to know you long lasting plan.  When the cat is away, the mice will play, so to speak.

    For long lasting change, there will need to be a "fly" on the wall so to speak in a nurse that will be hired to be on staff without the others knowing she is working for you as Governor to write a report in secret and send it to you about what she or he observes on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

    Otherwise, people will straighten up when you come by or when a family finds a loved one mistreated and the initial mistreatment may continue.  We have to nip this in the bud.

    Just like the Judiciary changes that need to be in place before some judge ruins a person's life by issuing an order that is entirely not fair and does not support a person's civil rights as according to our Constitution,or follows civil procedure.  We have SOME BIG PROBLEMS in our state that need OVERSEEING ON A REGULAR BASIS just like the Mortgage Lenders needed some REGULATION years ago to prevent the current disaster. 

    Well, you know my thoughts speak the truth.  We are either going to DO THE WORK or just talk about it as a lot of politicians have done in the past of which you are aware and visit every once in a while.  THAT WILL NEVER GET THE JOB DONE.

    MY PRAISES TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR.  AT LEAST YOU ARE STARTING OUT TO "KEEP PEOPLE ON THEIR TOES."  GOOD FOR YOU !

    Sincerely,

As far as finding insurance, she might want to contact the N.C. Health Insurance Risk Pool to see if she would qualify at:     <http://www.inclusivehealth.org/>http://www.inclusivehealth.org/



She’s doing the right thing by appealing the decision on her disability – that is Federal (CMS).  I hope she’ll find help with the Risk Pool.

Address: 320 Clairmont Circle, Greenville, NC 27834

Email: Kralice4u@hotmail.com

Subject: Health Care/Disability

Comment: I am a damsel in distress so to speak. I have been unemployed secondary to Fibromyalgia and various other health conditions. I am no longer able to make doctor's appointments due to the lack of funds and priamrily because I have no health insurance. I filed for social security disability and was denied (Of course). I went through an appeal and that was denied, now I am waiting to hear when I can go to a hearing before a judge! I am told that it will be at least a year and a half before I get an appointment. My health is failing; therefore I am getting WORSE! What in the world am I to do? I have worked since the age of 13 as a candy striper. I ahve worked hard all my life and already put into the system by working sometimes two and a half jobs. My husband and I are seperated due to his cocaine usage. I am struggling harder than ever. Social services in this city is a joke. Since I do not have a household full of children there is no assistance for me. I am told that I receive too much through Long term disability insurance from my last job to receive any assistance for food! I need some help! PLEASE! I need some health insurance for starters. There are medicines that I have had to do without because I can not afford them. I cover all the expenses in my home from Rent to phone, electricity. I do not have any extra money to make regular doctor visits. My vision is getting worse and I need to see an Optomitrist, but I can not afford to see one. Am I to believe that here in America if I am unable to work there is no help for me? Is the state hoping that I will die off before seeing the judge for disability hearing? What can you do to help me? PLEASE help me.

I think reply that if they feel laws were broken they should contact the DA.  Also, send to Revenue (and let them know that).  If tax fraud was committed, that's  where we should send it.

Since it starts as a work disability, send it to Kay to forward to the IC.  They would be able to advise him, I think.  (I think the problem is that we cannot assist him. -- they would know for sure.)

> Comment: I need help! I am a 60year-old male that has been disabled since Jan. 2002.When I became disabled I worked for Federal Mogul (FM) an automotive supplier. I was the Manager of Design Engineering. I asked FM everal times for a copy of the company disability policies and procedures. After 3years they gave me a copy finally at the same time they told me that they that they had over paid me $66,497.00 this was on Jan 27,2005.They said that they were stopping all my benifits until I paid this money back. The reason that they said I was over paid this time was because I did not inform them of my Soc.Sec. acceptance letter. (I have documentation that shows I did exactly what I was directed to do.)I had to get a lawyer to get them to agree to take only half of my disability pay so that I would not loose everything. The only reason they agreed was because they knew that they should have given me my disability policy within 90days of my becomeing disabled. (NOT 3 YEARS).FM sent me and my attorney a spread sheet that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Dec. 2008. This was not the first time they told me that I was overpaid. On Feb.18,2003 they stopped my benifits until I paid them back $2,184.44. Which they said was because they paid me 65% of my pay and I was only supposed to get 60%. (I have several letters from FM that states I was to get 65%, and besides how was I to know they would not give me a copy of the policies!!) On July 6, 2005 Metlife insurance co. (in 2005 FM turned my case over to MetLife to manage) sent me a letter that stated that they had over paid me $443.56 because they thought I was to get 65% of my income. I had to pay this back to resume my one half benifit. I received a letter from Metlife that stated the overpayment would be paid off in Feb. 2009 not Dec. 2008. I started questioning this in Sep 2008 because I didn't understand why. I have paid 4.04 years as stated in the spread sheet. Then metlife said it would not be paid off until July 2009. they could not tell me why so I continued to question metlife for 4 months. They sent me from one department to another. Finally in Nov. 2008 they told me that I was paid up and would start getting my full benifit starting Nov 2008. When I didn't get my full benifit I called again. They told me Now they are going ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2002 AND TAKING ALL OF MY COST OF LIVING INCREASE THAT I HAD RECIEVED FROM SOC. SEC. and that they will continue to take out as much as they deam appropriate!! I have talked to several attorneys and they all say the the law is on the side of the large companies and it will cost me a lot of money to fight it! How Can this be allowed? I am almost bankrupt because of this. I have had to barrow money from my children to buy food and pay my bills. I have sent a 5 page letter to President Obama, I have sent letters in the past to my congressman with no responce and a letter to Senator Dole and she sent it to the Labor Board who said that they could not help. I am getting desprate and have sent it to some of the News Papers with no responce. It seems that no one cares about the disabled in this country. HOW CAN THIS INJUSTICE BE ALLOWED? PLEASE HELP ME and I know if they are doing this to me they have to be doing it to others. P.S. Ihave documentation to back up everything I am telling you. Hope to hear from you soon. Paul Goad

> Comment: ****IMPORTANT:**** I expect strict confidence in this matter due to possible reprecussions. I meet every afternoon for coffee and drinks with a group of 10-15 local business men. Of course, we solve all political problems on a daily basis. We discuss national, state and local news and give our opinions. We have, for the past several months been discussing deficit spending and the problems our economies are having. We have one person that boasts he is paid $400 a day as a contractor under contract with the NC State Medicare program. He is a programmer. It bothers me because he also boosts that he mostly does word puzzles and plays computer games most of his working time. He says there is nothing for him to do since the state has been trying to decide who was to get the Medicare bid. Wednesday he boasted he changed vendors and asked how much the previous vendor was paid for his services. He was shocked when he was given that dollar amount. He asked for a raise with the new vendor and was given a $12 an hour raise to over $60 and hour. ****Again, I do not want my name brought up in this matter and will refuse any questioning.**** I simply think, with the current economy, this payment to a contractor is rediculious. I am sure he isn't the only contractor making this kind of money. I can't blame him for asking this kind of money but I can blame the State of NC for paying this kind of money for a vendor/contractor when there are hundreds of out of work citizen programmers who would love to have a job with the State making, say $25/hr or $52,000 as opposed to paying a contractor $62/hr or $128,960 a year to play computer games. He also boosts that he and some of his programmer friends will probably be hired for even more money by the company who just got the Medicare contract. When asked if he doesn't owe the State his loyalty and stay on with the State he laughts and says "that's their loss".

I just think say that we cannot intervene with OAH hearings, and that he should contact them to ascertain his appeal rights.

Box 629 Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 ISSUE Whether the Respondent wrongfully denied Petitioner’s request for salary credit for “non-teaching” experience based upon his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I with the North Carolina Department of Revenue. APPLICABLE STATUTES AND RULES Official notice is taken of the following statutes and rules applicable to this case: N.C. Gen Stat. § 150B-23 N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296 State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006 WITNESS FOR PETITIONER John M. Radford Robbie B. McLamb Lisa Beth Corser WITNESSES FOR RESPONDENT Sheila White Charles David Bennett Ellen Greaves EXHIBITS RECEIVED INTO EVIDENCE Petitioner Exhibits 1-7 were received into evidence. Respondent Exhibits 1-12 were received into evidence. BASED UPON careful consideration of the sworn testimony presented at the hearing and the entire record in this proceeding, the undersigned makes the following: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Respondent, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (“DPI”), is charged with the responsibility of licensing professional educators in North Carolina. 2. Teachers in North Carolina are paid on a salary schedule based upon experience level, meaning that a teacher receives a salary increase as his/her experience level increases. The salary schedule incremental increases are based upon both degree level and experience level. 3. Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-295, all teachers employed in the public schools of North Carolina must be certified, or licensed, to teach. North Carolina General Statute §115C-296(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows: The State Board of Education shall have entire control of certifying all applicants for teaching positions in all public elementary and high schools of North Carolina; and it shall prescribe the rules and regulations for the renewal and extension of all certificates and shall determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes. . . . N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 4. Pursuant to its statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes,” the State Board of Education (hereinafter the “SBE”) has adopted a policy, QP-A-006, entitled “Policies related to Experience/Degree Credit for Salary Purposes.” 5. The policy recognizes that educators employed in the public schools may be awarded salary credit for past employment experience as well as for certain graduate degrees. Generally, the salary credit falls into three main categories: (1) prior experience as a teacher; (2) prior work experience that is non-teaching in nature; and (3) possession of a graduate degree. 6. Respondent employs licensure specialists to evaluate license applications and also to evaluate requests for non-teaching work experience for salary schedule purposes. 7. Licensure specialists are given a three-page policy guide and a general information guide, both of which list North Carolina State Board of Education’s policy on granting experience/degree credit for salary purposes. The documents state how salaries are calculated and who is eligible for the experience/degree credit. 8. In order to be eligible to receive credit for prior “non-teaching” work experience, the prior work experience must meet several criteria. The critical factor for deciding whether to award “non-teaching” work experience credit, however, is whether that prior work experience is “directly related” to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. 9. Specifically, QP-A-006 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Non-teaching work experience shall be defined as professional work experience in public or private sectors that is directly related to an individual’s area of licensure and work assignment. State Board of Education Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20 (emphasis added). 10. Petitioner is currently employed by the Wayne County Public Schools as a Guidance Counselor under a provisional license, and only has four more courses to complete. 11. After beginning employment as a Guidance Counselor in 2005, Petitioner requested credit for past non-teaching work experience. The Local Education Authority recommended that Petitioner receive credit for 16 years. 12. Petitioner’s request for credit was initially denied by members of licensure staff at the Department of Public Instruction. The denial was based upon the Department’s determination that the prior experience was not “directly related” to Petitioner’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. 13. Following this initial denial, and pursuant to SBE Policy QP-A-006, Petitioner’s employer, Wayne County Schools, requested a review by the Experience Credit Appeals Panel. 14. The school system and Petitioner submitted further documentation in support of his request for non-teaching experience credit, including official job descriptions from his Revenue Officer I position, official job description of a school guidance counselor, and Petitioner’s own comparison of his previous job duties with the job duties of school guidance counselor. 15. According to the official job description of the Revenue Officer I, the person in that position: is responsible for resolving complex, high liability delinquent tax cases. The Revenue Officer I must possess comprehensive knowledge of all tax schedules in order to determine tax liability, secure delinquent tax returns, conduct tax investigations, and assist taxpayers with filing delinquent returns. The Revenue Officer I position plays a key role in the Department’s enforcement efforts to enhance taxpayer compliance by educating the public and collecting the State’s General Fund Revenues. 16. The job description divides the duties of the Revenue Officer I into two categories: (1) Research and Enforcement; and (2) Administration of the North Carolina Revenue Laws. 17. Research and Enforcement comprises about 90% of the duties and includes various investigative duties. Petitioner admitted on the stand that, consistent with the job description, he frequently dealt with the Department of Motor Vehicles, with lawyers and clerks of the court, with banks and bank records, and with the Employment Security Commission. Petitioner had to review court tax records and the grantor-grantee indexes in the courthouse. He stated he had to have a working knowledge of accounting concepts, business law and tax schedules. 18. In fact, Petitioner’s prior experience was deemed to be creditable towards his other license area of “business education” and “middle grades business.” The Licensure Section determined that Petitioner’s work as a Revenue Officer I was “directly related” to the area of business education, and awarded him the full 16 years’ experience credit. However, his prior experience as a Revenue Officer I, while related to business, was not related to guidance counseling and was not transferable under the State Board Policy. (“Credit for non-teaching work experience is not transferable to other licensure areas for which the experience is not relevant.” SBE Policy QP-A-006, section 6.20). 19. The purpose of the school guidance counselor, as set forth in the job description, is to “promote student success, provide preventative services, and respond to identified student needs by implementing a comprehensive school counseling program that addresses academic career, and personal/social development for all students.” 20. The school guidance counselor is responsible for interpreting student test data; assisting students in developing academic and career goals; working with parents, the community and students concerning identified concerns and needs; providing individual and group counseling; interacting and communicating with teachers, administrators, and other school personnel; adhering to relevant laws, policies, and procedures; monitoring student academic performance, behavior and attendance; and assists with appropriate intervention. 21. All of the information submitted by Petitioner in support of his request was presented to the Appeals Panel at its September 26, 2006, meeting. The Panel reviewed the material and compared the official job responsibilities of the prior work experience with the Standard Course of Study and job expectations of the position of school guidance counselor. 22. The Panel consists of professional educators, none of whom is employed by the State Board of Education or the Department of Public Instruction. The Panel was created to give another level of review in the process and specifically to permit teachers another opportunity to present information in an objective forum. The Panel is inclined to give the benefit of a doubt to teachers but nevertheless seek to award credit only within the strict letter of the State Board’s policy and to ensure consistency in the process statewide. 23. The Panel here thoroughly reviewed and considered the information submitted, and after deliberating, voted unanimously to deny Petitioner’s request. 24. Two members of the Panel testified at the hearing of this matter. Both stated that, in their opinion, the job duties of the Revenue Officer I were not sufficiently related to the job duties of school guidance counselor to award salary credit. The role of a school guidance counselor involves assessing student test data, dealing with the student’s future plans, working with parents, and assisting students with interpersonal skills. 25. While Petitioner described some job duties that involved working with taxpayers on a personal level, as Respondent’s witnesses pointed out, most employees, especially those in professional capacities, engage in some counseling. 26. Petitioner admitted on the stand that he did not deal with adolescents, did not deal with class schedules, did not deal with testing or scholarships, did not deal with teachers or principals, and was not familiar with school laws. 27. The term “directly related” as used in the State Board Policy at issue here, and as applied by DPI staff and the Panel members, is a term of art that is understood by the licensure staff, by members of the Panel, and by personnel administrators in the local school systems. 28. Licensure staff is trained on the job for six to nine months prior to being permitted to apply the policy without oversight by supervisors. The Panel members worked closely with the policy in earlier attempts to revise portions of it and have had substantial experience in applying it to real situations. The term “directly related,” sometimes used interchangeably with “directly relevant,” describes the process of comparing “what the person was doing in a verifiable way in their [sic] past . . . with the specific responsibilities and knowledge and skills that would be required to fulfill the position in public education.” 29. As stated by Dr. Ellen Greaves, a licensed attorney and educator and member of the Panel, there is no precise formula for determining whether the prior experience is “directly related” to one’s area of licensure and teaching assignment. It is a “situationally contextual understanding.” In this case, the direct relationship did not exist and the Panel voted unanimously to deny the credit. BASED UPON the foregoing Findings of Fact, the undersigned makes the following: CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The parties are properly before the Office of Administrative Hearings. 2. Petitioner bears the burden of proving the claims alleged in the Petition by a preponderance of evidence. Peace v. Employment Sec. Comm’n., 349 N.C. 315, 507 S.E.2d 272 (1998). 3. The State Board of Education has the constitutional power “to supervise and administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for its support.” N.C. Const. art IX, § 5. This power includes the power to “regulate the grade [and] salary . . . of teachers.” Guthrie v. Taylor, 279 N.C. 703, 709, 185 S.E.2d 193, 198 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 32 L.Ed.2d 119 (1972). The State Board has the specific duty “to certify and regulate the grade and salary of teachers and other school employees.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-12(9)a; Guthrie at 711. 4. Finally, the State Board has the statutory authority to “determine and fix the salary for each grade and type of certificate which it authorizes . . . .” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-296(a). 5. While Petitioner’s duties as a Revenue Officer I were directly related to or relevant to his former position as a business teacher, his duties as a Revenue I Officer were not directly related to or relevant to his new duties as a school Guidance Counselor. 6. In reaching this determination the court relies upon the testimony of individuals with years of experience in applying the policy and the uninterrupted interpretation of that policy over the years. This court may rely upon consistent interpretation by a State Agency of its own statutes and policies in reaching a conclusion with regard to the application of a particular policy to a given set of facts. See State v. Jones, 358 N.C. 473, 598 S.E.2d 125 (2004); Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Hunt, 350 N.C. 39, 510 S.E.2d 159 (1999). Moreover, the agency’s interpretation of its own policies is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous. Morrell v. Flaherty, 338 NC 230, 237, 449 S.E.2d 175, 179-80 (1994). 7. Petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that Respondent has deprived him of property or has otherwise substantially prejudiced his rights and that Respondent has: (1) Exceeded its authority; (2) Acted erroneously; (3) Failed to use proper procedure; (4) Acted arbitrarily or capriciously; or (5) Failed to act as required by law or rule. DECISION The undersigned recommends that the State Board of Education affirm the decision of the Department to deny the Petitioner the relief requested. ORDER AND NOTICE The Agency that will make the final decision in this contested case is the North Carolina State Board of Education. The Agency is required to give each party an opportunity to file exceptions to the recommended decision and to present written arguments to those in the Agency who will make the final decision. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150-36(a). The Agency is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36(b) to serve a copy of the final decision on all parties and to furnish a copy to the parties’ attorney of record and to the Office of Administrative Hearings. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 150B-36 the Agency shall adopt each finding of fact contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision unless the finding is clearly contrary to the preponderance of the admissible evidence. For each finding of fact not adopted by the agency, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the reasons for not adopting the finding of fact and the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in not adopting the finding of fact. For each new finding of fact made by the agency that is not contained in the Administrative Law Judge’s decision, the agency shall set forth separately and in detail the evidence in the record relied upon by the agency in making the finding of fact.

Gov. Beverly Perdue signaled to a feminist group Wednesday morning that she would be a stalwart defender of a woman's right to an abortion.

"North Carolina is going to be a state where choice is safe under my watch," Perdue told about 230 people at a breakfast sponsored by Lillian's List, an abortion rights group.

Dear Governor Perdue,
Back in mid-January, I sent an e-mail to this web address asking for you to consider eliminating the state's current 7% tax on retiree pensions but have not, at this time, received any reply (other than the automatic "Thank you for your question and your request will be handled as quickly as possible".  Unfortunately, I have no idea what is meant by "as quickly as possible" so therefore I would like to explain my situation to you once again.  During these hard economic times, most of us had our retirement savings locked into 401K or other type of IRA accounts and have seen our net worth crumble by more than half over the past year alone.  I for one, am now getting concerned about my ability to pay my monthly mortgage out of my remaining funds.  I know that retirement accounts were tax deferred and I am going to have to pay taxes on these funds as I need to withdraw them (which I have to do now every month) but, when I moved down here from Michigan in 2006 after my retirement, I had no idea that North Carolina taxed retiree pensions at 7% of total.  In Michigan, your first $75,000 of pension is tax-free and then I believe the rate is something like 3% for anything over $75,000.  I knew that Tennessee and Florida did not tax pensions at all but I had no idea just how heavily NC taxed them.  In these hard economic times, I am begging you to help out retirees on fixed incomes and remove the 7% income tax on pensions.  We have worked our entire lives paying taxes and, in our golden years, I think we should be given a break and allowed to live out the rest of our lives without having to worry about how we are going to keep the roofs over our heads.  As I stated at the beginning of this letter, this is the second time I have sent you this request.  I never heard anything back from you regarding my first e-mail.  I hope to hear back regarding this one.

                                                                                                                               Sincerely,

I hope the Department of Health/Human Services in North Carolina can reconsider what I hear is a decision no longer to support the Drug Effectiveness Review Program, via the Center for Evidence-based Practice at the Oregon Health and Sciences University.  The "DERP" is one of the most effective and useful programs that North Carolina has supported -- providing unparalleled information useful for Medicaid and S-CHIP, about the comparative benefits and harms of medications that might be used for populations covered by those state insurance programs.  Especially with new monies coming to the state for the stimulus, this is no time for North Carolina not to participate fully in a highly successful program.  Please see the attached for further information.

Thank you!

Thank you, once again for your reply but,  I am now becoming increasing concerned about receiving an "actual answer"  from North Carolins'a 's state government compared to this type of  what, appears to me,  to be some type of computerized  acknowledgment of my message  . It seems to me that it would be  somewhat more believable if  I received an actual e-mail with a name other than "FROM THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR" to acknowledge my e-mail.  This type of previous acknowledgement was the same that I have received after sending you several prior e-mails regarding this matter.  (NOTE:  Do you have any idea what my initial question even was??)   I am sure you can see how frustrating this is becoming.  I truly await for an actual response from Governor Perdue..  The result of this exchange will confirm whether or not these type of e-mails are really being looked at or simply being tossed into a trash can after sending out an electronic "we will look into this" response. .  I hope I find d that Govenor Perdue (or her staff) actually read these e-mails and state the Govenor's policy (without any "B.S.) to let us know where she stands on various aspects (including this one regarding taxing  pensions).  I initially asked this question back in early January and I anxiously await a response to this question from a real person who represents Governor Perdue's view on this matter.  Please allow a real person to contact me either by e-mail or by phone @ 828-891-3608.

> Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My wife and I moved to Western North Carolina from Michigan after our retirement in 2006 mainly becuase of the beauty of the mountains and the more temperate climate afforded by this region. I was only after completing our move and getting our 2007 taxes ready that we found out that NC taxes pensions at 7% of total earned. This came as a total shock to us and something we were not prepared for in the least. In Michigan, the first $75,000 of pension in tax-free and only 4% above that limit is taxable. We truly love it here but this loss of income (especially since it is fixed) is causing a terrible hardship on our standard of living. I am therefore imporing you to consider eliminating this unfair tax on senior citizens with nothing but fixed incomes to live off of. I know times are tough financially for all at this point in time but seniors get hit the hardest because their income is so low and losing an additional 7% makes it all the worse. Thank you for your consideration regarding this matter and I look forward to hearing back from you regarding your decision.

Well, since he’s demanding.  What he is referring to is a recommendation of the 21st Century Transportation Committee.  Here is the address of the committee website:  http://www.ncleg.net/documentsites/committees/21stCenturyTransportation/Homepage/ 



All the information he would like is available there, including the contact information of the legislators on the committee, and the final report and recommendation.  Here’s the recommendation he wants information about:



Vehicle Miles Traveled {VMT} Fee. The Committee recognizes the State needs an

alternative or supplement to the motor fuels tax. This fee would be a true user-fee

independent of type or amount of fuel consumed. These days, North Carolinians are

traveling more miles in more vehicles. However, our roadways are suffering from lack of

maintenance and new construction due to the slow growth of motor fuels tax revenues

due to improvements in fuel economy One possible solution is to base our tax on how

much we drive, not how much fuel we consume – in other words, a “Vehicle Miles

Traveled Fee” (VMT Fee). With the VMT fee the consumers would pay taxes

proportionately to the number of miles they drive. There is a pilot project in Oregon that

is testing the feasibility of a VMT fee. A simple approach to a VMT fee is to charge each

passenger vehicle and truck 1/4 cent for each mile driven. The average driver drives

12,000 miles per year, so with an exemption for the first 2000 miles the cost to the

average driver would be $25. This fee could be collected as a part of the vehicle annual

inspection program. In addition, the General Assembly should consider authorizing a

local option VMT fee.



It’s important to note this was not even a recommendation of a committee who’s job it was to make recommendation regarding the nature of funding of the NC road system.  It was not a recommendation of the general assembly, the Governor, nor any specific legislator.  Additionally, the draft legislation that was part of the final report of the committee AND the legislation that was introduced in both houses as the recommendation of the committee DID NOT HAVE THIS PROVISION. 



The VMT is “one possible solution” proposed by the committee, but it is not one recommended by the committee.  It is always possible a legislator may introduce this as legislation before the bill filling deadline, but at present this isn’t even pending legislation.

> Comment: Ms. Perdue, My name is Shawn Foreman, I am 26, I live in Goldsboro, North Carolina and I attend North Carolina Wesleyan College. I am a student of Paula Harrell, I have heard her speak of you working to change things that the previous governor had put into place. As a student of higher learning I have a simple question I would like answered. I would like the question explained to me in laymens terms, not the usual spin that is put on things to confuse people. I am an average citizen with a below average job. I work at a pet supplies store and I make a measly 7 dollars an hour. My question is, why in the world am I in a 38% tax bracket when my income is so little? I make less than two hundred dollars a week, yet the state along with the federal government takes nearly half of what I make. That is completely unacceptable to me. I do not make that much, I barely make enough to pay my bills and I'm sure that I'm not the only one that this is happening to, I'm just smart enough to notice it. It's rip offs such as this that is ruining our country and that is contributing to our current economic crisis. I'm almost certain I won't get a straight answer from anyone that I contact but I am making my voice heard. This is completely unacceptable to me and I am willing to go through all of the proper channels to have this question answered and perhaps have it corrected. You represent the people of this state and I expect my Governor to work for the average citizen that placed him/her in office. And with this being a concern to me I expect a straight foward answer. I am certainly sure that I am not the only one who is getting screwed. A 38% tax on a person who makes less than eleven thousand dollars a year is completely and utterly ridiculous. I apologize if I seem a bit caustic but when the government is getting nearly half of what I make and they do nothing but give my money to banks and C.E.O.'s of auto companies I get a little pissed off. I look foward to hearing from you concerning this issue. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Shawn Foreman

It's and AG issue.  (and this is why it's NEVER a good idea to put more on a card than you can pay in a month!!!)  The law allows (I THINK) up to 30 %, so they would also need to contact their delegation about getting the laws changed.

Phone: (919)733-4240 Fax: (919)733-2120 I may submit to you online, but I cannot communicate back and forth, so absolutely no E-mails. Greeting to you, the Honorable and first Woman Governor, of the State of North Carolina, the Honorable: Governor Bev Perdue, I am writing to you today letting you know of many things as I have just done, via fax to your office 2/17/2009 2:17:46 PM. I sent to you letters of the things of which I have endured in the state of North Carolina and the State of New York: the United States of America. But please let me show concern for we here of the County of Warrenton or that of the Granville Counties. That already we are getting an understanding that another drought may be on the way. And we of these counties already pay a very huffy price for the water we use. Major construction has undergone and we the citizens of these counties have been stuck with the bill. There was a time when my water bill read of $25. , but even before this major construction was in play, that even changed. My water bill went from, $25.00 to 43.00 and from that to $47.00 and from this to $76. 00 At where it is now standing at $79. This was all for the amount of 3000, gallons, but as to my understanding this has shortened to 2000, gallons of water and sadly I am not all that sure if this is the complete amount of water set to the standard limit before the price increases or if that is for sewage and also drinking, separately. But on: 1/26/2009 3:15:02 PM I have sent my concerns, via fax to the: NC Utilities Commission - Public Staff 4326 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-4326 Phone: (919) 733-5610 Fax: (919) 715-6704, Public Staff - Consumer Services Division 4326 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-4326 Telephone: (919) 733-9277 Facsimile: (919) 733-4744 With this letter, in which, Mr. Carl Goldstein, at 919-733-9682 gave me someone else to make contact with and the other has not responded, On 12/9/2008 12:40:30 PM, this letter of complaint was faxed to this particular office below: NC Division of Water Resources, DENR - 1611 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-1611 Phone: (919)733-4064 â€“ Fax: (919)733-3558 Water Resource Engineer 919-715-5453 Greetings to you at the North Carolina: Division of Water Resources, my name is Mr. Dwayne Keith Mobley and today I would like to try again to make this complaint to your office, as my first letter of complaint was forwarded to The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. I have made letters of complaint concerning the prices of water that we citizens of the county of Warrenton, pay monthly. I have been a resident, where I reside in the county of Warrenton, for over seven years and since then I have seen the price of my Water, skyrocket. When I first moved into my apartment, the price of what I used, was no more than; $24, from there it went to $44, and than $46, and change to $74, and change, to where I has been at &79, and change. NCDENR, 1601 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-1601 919-733-4984 Fax 919-715-3060 When I first made this complaint someone from my county, phoned me concerning the problem, as if you told them to do so, and I feel that you did not and so, how did they know as I spoke with a Mr. Perkenson of the Warrenton County Water Department. But I was told that our county has a new system of how our sewage is taken from the county and that new system has a greater challenge of taking the sewage away from us, as this challenge consist of our sewage traveling up-hill and the power needed to do this has the forced the county to spend money on the necessary equipment and this cost has been pasted on to the consumer. I feel that after the severe drought we had, that forced the usage of water in North Carolina, to its limits and after this act of nature subsided, that relief in paying for water would not have remained so expensive, but it has and there seems very little we can do about this. So what are we going to do if the act of nature arises again? And sadly nothing ever came for me in response to this and so I felt that being I may have failed to make this a responsive complaint with the State of North Carolina, that you should made very much aware of the prices we the people must pay in order to use regular drinking water, here in the State of North Carolina. As these are prices we pay, after all the restrictions placed on some, concerning water usage and added prices for over-usage. I will not call, but a written response from you would greatly be appreciative, as I make this statement also stating that there are no exceptions to this comment, that it must be in writing. I feel that someone did in fact response to my concerning my first letter of complaint, as I did not get it, as this is due to the theft and fraud of my U.S. Mail. What are we people of the poor, as I am, going to do if we suffer with another drought and water prices must continue to rise? Do we then turn to the Department of Social Services, for help financially as well, provide payment for water also. The Governorâ€™s office, made restrictions on the prices of gas, but what of that with water? This must be look at as price gauging, even after I was told that our sewage system is a new one and is under great stress to take our sewage uphill, away from the area to its final destination and that alone cost, just to pump that sewage away from us to a more better area of which can handle the waste, but is that my fault that engineers were not able to find better ways of disposing of the countyâ€™s waste. When I first moved where I still live, as is at the top of my letter, we did not even have a Sewage price or was there any mention of sewage on the bill itself at all, but since certain county unpublicized take-over, as I state this concerning the Granville countyâ€™s, much have been added on to we the people. No exceptions, you must provide me with a letter of response! If I am unable to fax to you this letter today; Monday, I will do so the next business day!

Subject: Bryson City

Comment: Today my sister contacted me about a situation that I thought should be brought someones attention. Recently my brother Richard Keith Poe was released from prison. My brother is mentally unstable. I know this because he is my brother and has torchered and abused our family for years. He sexually molested several children when he was 13. He beat and choked my mother. He has abused every woman he has ever been with. I had him put in Broughton mental hospital once. His latest is my 85 year old father that he held a knife to his throat and told him he is going to kill him. After 2 days my sister called my father and he was able to tell her what was going on. She went with a sheriff to the house and took my father from there . The magistrate in Bryson city said they couldnt do anything because it had been 2 days since he did it. Well Richard has now gotten someone to take him to a truck stop close to where my sister lives. I feel your office needs to investigate why Bryson city isnt doing thier job. Richard has said on a number of times that he intends on killing his family. Someone need to do something before its to late.

To our Governor/Legislators,
We have a problem. A complaint has been filed with Pitt County Branch NAACP because ECBH withdrew mental health endorsement from a minority National Accreditation agency known as Parakletos Services Incorporation. This is an agency that provides community support services in (14) North Carolina counties.

This agency achieved National Accreditation from CARF in September as mandated by the State. How is this Possible??

We have learned that NC DHHS/DMA has not completed the appeals process with this agency within 90 days as mandated by the summer 2008 legislation.

At this time this Agency has lost ability to provide services and their medicaid number has been terminated.

This matter needs immediate attention.

How can we allow this to happen to providers who are National Accrediated and who stand to loose their Endorsement by subjective interpertation of rules, procedures, and service delivery?

Our policy is to request you to please immediately look into this matter, and to assure this Agency regain their Mental Health Endorsement and other certification inorder to continue to provide this outstanding service that is so badly needed in our communities across this state.

"With the NAACP, an injustice anywhere, is an injustice everywhere".

Calvin C. Henderson
President
Pitt County Branch NAACP

I have also worked as a furniture craftsmen for 32 yrs. I work for a place called "Hickory White" (I helped make the new furniture in our state senate,how do you like it?) Furniture has been made at my workplace since 1902. However, for years now our employer has been sending more and more of our work to his plant in Vietnam. At the same time a flood of import furniture is driving us out of our jobs! I know there are plans in motion for job retraining, but how about some job PROTECTION? I am age 50 and it's a bit late in my life to transition into another occupation. Why should we be forced out of our present jobs because a greedy employer wants to exploit cheap labor overseas and doge US.Labor laws and fair pay to American workers? If the working middle class is "The backbone of our economy" Why then do our representatives in our own government aid men like my employer in breaking that backbone? How about a high import tax?

> Comment: Governor: I am Lucille Ferry, CEO/Founder of The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. I founded Foxglove for help to displaced families. In my work in getting my corporation off the ground I have experienced my own displacement. I had my identity stolen from me and it took 2 years of fighting with Texas and Florida to get a new and valid state ID. There is no national database that can help a person when this happens and a person has to have documentation from more than one state in order for them to get their new identity card. One of the things that I want to be able to do at The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. is to put together a database with the help of state leadership that will enable us to work with any family so that when a fire, flood or other disaster happens to a family, their documentation can be gotten in a timely fashion and their identity restored. When I had my identity stolen I contacted Texas because Florida requires a valid birth certificate to replace the lost ID. Texas told me I had to have a valid ID to get a copy of my birth certificate. The wrangling that went on between the states and myself lasted for two years until I rolled (I am in a wheelchair) into the DMV and said I wanted the Florida supervisor to contact Texas and see what besides my paychecks, IRS statements, and residency receipts would they take in order for me to get a birth certificate. It is my goal to help others so that they will not have to go through what I went through. It is even harder when that ID is used for a criminal act. The person whose ID is used to buy or steal things and the bill is sent to the person whose ID was used while the criminal keeps racking up charges against the owner of the ID. I would like to know who in Raleigh would be the person/department that I could work with so that we can create a database that would have information from each state showing what that state required in order for an id or a birth certificate or a death certificate or a wedding license to be gotten. This would be a secured database so that no one could log in to our system and gain access to information that would create a even greater criminal act. Then when a family comes to us we can pull up that database and see what is required, what can be used as an alternate , and what the cost is in getting the required documentation. This will allow us to help the families so they can have access to their bank accounts, cash checks, replace credit cards, or go to buildings or jobs where their ID is required. The following link is to our temporary web site. We are having a .org site built This will give you some more information about who we are and what we will be doing to help families. Since I have started this project 4 years ago 7 more cities, some in Florida and some in other states have requested a project like ours. I have told them that we would be glad to come and establish our displaced family program in their area but I have to get Jacksonville up and running first. I now have a Board of Directors that not only see the vision but embrace it. I want to be the first call that Disaster Services makes when a family needs housing. Our mission states says "When housing counts". This is my passion. This will enable Disaster Services to spend their limited funds helping in other areas. This will enable a family in crisis to have a safe place to stay together while we get their house, their ID or their job rebuilt, repaired, or replaced. Whatever you can do to help us will be most appreciated. Sincerely, L M Ferry CEO/Founder The Foxglove Foundation, Inc. 904-647-9059 foxglove123@comcast.net www.geocities.com/foxgloverich/

Comment: I read Governor Perdue's comments in Stateline.org from the Pew Center and I'm curious about any restructuring efforts you are pursuing. I work in the Governor's Office here in Michigan and am working with a group that is looking at restructuring our current 18 departments down to 8. I'd be curious to swap best practices or ideas with anyone charged with doing the same work there. My sister is a resident of Asheville, N.C. and has said some very kind things about Governor Perdue. In addition to the e-mail address provided, I can be reached directly at (517) 335-0344. I look forward to hearing from someone soon. Thank-you!

I think since it's Carteret County we should make sure to reply.  Tell her that we've sent her e-mail to the State Treasurer's office (to see about the State Retirement Question), and to the Department of Justice (to see about the attorney representation).  Ask Lisette to see if the Law Enforcement folks can offer any assistance.

And memory loss issues.  He is limited to how long he can sit and walk. He try’s but it is very painful to sit for a long time and he can only walk short distances before he has to sit.  He has a 10th grade education and did get his GED and then went through BLET.  No other education.  His Doctor said in his letter to them that he would never be able to hold a job.  My question to you is, are there any state assistance from attorneys from the state with regards to any help with this claim as he is retired from the State Local Government Retirement Plan or from the Disability Act. I feel like they are trying to confuse the medical documentation because he went to specialist for his injuries.   I don't think the processors are trying to put the whole package together to see the whole picture from all the specialists.    Do you have any suggestions on any agencies we can go to for help?

With our fundraising efforts, we are able to supply eye exams and glasses, hearing aids, low vision readers to those who would otherwise go without. In addition to helping our community, we are able to contribute to the many state and international programs that make Lions Club International the incredible organization that it is. We also remember those who are alone, by visiting them throughout the year and surprising them with Christmas gifts. One of our major fundraising events is scheduled for October 3, and it is the Tractor Show and Fall Festival that funds many of our projects. I would like ask if you would donate something for our auction or perhaps, even come to our event! Last year, our raffles made over $1,000 which is a GREAT amount for us. I am hoping that we will be able to double that this year and I am asking for your help.

Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2009 15:21:51 -0500

February 20, 2009



Dear Governor Perdue,



The timing of this weekend’s National Governors Association Winter meeting, which focuses on “rebuilding, repairing and maintaining a national infrastructure system that supports America's economic competitiveness, facilitates economic growth and is environmentally sustainable” could not be more opportune. [1]  As American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding starts flowing, you will have to make decisions very soon about how to improve North Carolina’s deteriorating roads and bridges and its transit, bikeway and walkway systems, which are in dire need of investments.



The Act, which provides $735,526,684in flexible Surface Transportation Program (STP) funding, offers you a unique opportunity to create the kinds of jobs that will help build an infrastructure for the 21st century.  As you gather with your fellow governors, we urge you to lead by example in your home state by directing the state’s transportation department to make the long list of ready-to-go transit, highway and bridge repair, bicycle, and pedestrian projects the top spending priorities for your STP funding from the Act. Contrary to some recent news stories and other sources, the STP is designed and intended to fund numerous modes of transportation, not simply highways.[2] 



Use of the funds in this manner would have immediate payoffs for the state. A 2004 study by the Surface Transportation Policy Project using Federal Highway Administration data and modeling found that investment in public transportation creates approximately 19 percent more jobs than new road or bridge projects.  Construction projects that repair our existing roads and bridges, many of which are crumbling under us every day, can be quickly stated and, according to the study, would create 9 percent more jobs than projects that add new highway capacity.[3]  



The most recent National Bridge Inventory estimated that 5,059 bridges in North Carolina were structurally deficient. The extra funding provided by the Recovery Act provides an unprecedented opportunity to make up for lost time. However, the list of transportation projects proposed by state officials for Recovery Act funding misses this chance by focusing instead on new highway construction and expansion.



 A key purpose of the Recovery Act is to put Americans to work building the infrastructure system you are set to discuss in Washington this weekend.  Spending these dollars on bridge and road repair, public transit, safer routes for pedestrians and bicyclists will do just that – and will provide a better, dollar for dollar investment than building new and unnecessary highway capacity.  The benefits reaped through reductions in green house gas emissions, commute times, traffic congestion and energy costs makes the superior return on these investments even greater.



In his statement on the signing of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood said, “We will use the transportation funding in the Act to deliver jobs and restore our nation's economy.  We will emphasize sustainable investment and focus our policies on the people, businesses and communities who use the transportation systems.  And, we will focus on the quality of our environment.  We will build and restore our transportation foundations until the American dream is returned.”  We urge you to share Secretary LaHood’s message with your fellow governors this weekend as you travel to Washington, but more importantly to take charge right here in North Carolina by investing the money in projects that advance these critical principles.



We are pleased to make ourselves available as you and your administration make timely decisions about spending Recovery Act funds and would be happy to provide specific examples of the kinds of ready-to-go projects that should be given top priority. We believe that greater public involvement in the choice of projects and the creation of effective information systems for the public to track Recovery Act investments will only enhance the effectiveness of and support for those investments. 



Moreover, we are quite encouraged by your commitment to building a sustainable infrastructure, developing clean energy, and growing green jobs.  In addition, your dedication to accountability measures helps to ensure that the people of North Carolina benefit from the Reinvestment and Recovery Act.



Thank you for giving this letter your careful consideration.



Sincerely,



Ashley

Dear Governor Perdue;

The hottest thing to come along in years is the motorized bicycle, sometimes referred to as "power-assisted vehicles", "human-electric hybrids", "pedelecs" (for pedal electric cycles) combine the driver's pedaling with a motorized assist from a rechargeable electric battery, which can be plugged into any standard AC outlet.  This is in contrast to mopeds or motorcycles, which run on gas and have environmentally polluting combustion engines like those in cars. The rider turns the electric assistance on or off using a toggle or a twist of the handle grip and can choose and entirely electric ride, an entirely pedaled ride or a ride combining electric with pedal power.

Great America Electric Bicycle Company (GAEBC) was formed to offer the public and exciting new mode of transportation for the family and commuter - electric bicycles and scooters.  On December 9, 2002 President George W Bush signed into Public Law PL107-319, which defined a low-speed electric bicycle as any bicycle with fully operable pedals, and electric motor not exceeding 750 Watts (1 H.P) of power and a top motor-powered speed not in excess of 20 miles per hour.  An electric bicycle, scooter or tricycle that meets these limitations is regarded as a bicycle.  This law places electric bicycles under jurisdiction of the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) rather than the Department of Transportation (DOT).  In North Carolina a driver's license is not required, and the bicycle/scooter/tricycle does not have to be registered, inspected or covered by liability insurance.  A helmet is required by law in North Carolina.  The motor cannot exceed 750 Watts have an external shifting device or the capability of exceeding 30 miles per hour on a level surface.

Great America Electric Bicycle Outletis a licensee of GAEBC and opened a retail store in beautiful Historic Downtown Apexon Salem Street and has the largest inventory of Electric Scooters, Bicycle's and Tricycles in North Carolina.  They offer a wide range of electric bicycles that will meet the need of every person.  They include electric bicycles, scooters, fold-able bicycles, mountain bicycles and three wheeled tricycles ranging from 180 watts 36 volt 12 AH, to 750 Watt 60 volt 20 AH models.  Our bicycles travel between 20 and 30 mph taking you effortlessly around town, to your place of work or just on a leisurely ride with your children.  There are 11 models to choose from in a variety of new exciting colors that will be sure to get you noticed around town.  Most models come standard with an audible motion sensor alarm and remote control key fob, for your security.  Forget about gasoline and maintenance. Electric bicycles can scoot around town with 40 miles between charges and recharge in less than 6 hours.  The batteries are recharged at the same cost as running a small electric light in your home. 

At Great America Electric Bicycles Outlet outstanding customer service along with a superior product is there number one priority.  We have a Gold Key Service Department, carry every part available and have a 2 year warranty on the motor and battery.  Our electric bicycles meet the requirements of Energy Star Complying Green Products, as defined by US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Department of Energy.  Non -polluting and low noise requirements. 

We would like to invite you to take a test drive today! 

I would be happy to bring an assortment of my electric bicycles to  the Governor's office so you can see for yourself how you

save the public money by going green while having a great time. 

I look forward to meeting you.

Dear Governor Purdue,

We need your help.

Below is a msg to Commissioner  Mark Jones outlining a most severe problem in Jackson County
and the surrounding areas; Lack of high speed Broadband.
Also my response to Ron Masssingale at Balsam-West below that.

Balsam-West has the Fiber in the ground already in several areas, but lacks the funds to hook up small businesses and private homes.
I spoke with Balsam-West, owner of the Fiber cable, installed from Sylva to Cashiers, NC ., funded by Private monies yesterday.
Ron Massingale Vice President of Sales & Marketing,  BalsamWest FiberNet, 704-896-3666

He stated that his company simply can not afford to hook up businesses or private homes along the route of

of their fiber cable due to the high costs of doing so and not being able to show a return.
