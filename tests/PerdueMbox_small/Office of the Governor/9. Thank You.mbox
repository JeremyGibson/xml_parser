Thank you for your quick response.  I am glad my voice is heard in my Governor's office.  The information you provided me is the same information that I received in your packet.  I will gladly take the nutrition counseling and lower medication costs for weight lose products.  In fact I will never turn down any assistance to help control my weight.  I have always hated my body and the way I look.  I am not trying to make excuses but, being fat is not like smoking.  I was 10 lbs the day I was born into an entire family of overweight people, who as far back as our family photos go, were over weight.  Even as a child I tried dieting in the 1st grade.  My sister and I were both placed on diet pills by our doctor when we were in 4th and 5th grades.  Can any smoker say they were born with a cigarette in their mouth?  These two issues are not the same.  I did not wake up one day and decide today I will begin gaining weight.  I never remember a time when I was not over weight.  My blood pressure is good, my heart is strong ( just had a echo to prove that).  My blood sugar, cholesterol, thyroid, kidney function are all normal.  I just have some T-Cells that float around and need to watched.  Since loosing over 100 lbs  I have begged you, the insurance company, to help me have surgery to remove loose skin that droops half way down my thighs and causes major skin irritation.  That alone would decrease my weight by at least 20 lbs.  I have skin that just hangs off  my upper arms, another 5 lbs easy.  These surgeries would help me feel better physically (when I walk or exercise I become rubbed raw between my legs and under my belly apron area from the sweat and friction.  No amount of counseling will help that.  Your work place wellness programs are only as good as a "work place" makes it.  Without my county schools using your information, it is no more helpful to me than any other diet book or magazine on my shelf. 

Your willing to take things from me and people like me, but not help me.  Removal of my loose skin will help alleviate a significant barrier in my exercise routine.  It is hard  to go home after work and exercise up a good sweat and heart rate, when you know you will have painful sores which will make simply walking on my job difficult the next day.  

I am sorry I still see this as a way to weed out those who you think, are costing you money.  You wont approve my surgeries, it costs you money.  You wont allow me to pay for a higher premium of insurance, it costs you money.  Let's just face it, this is not about "helping" me be healthy and happy.  It's about money and I am just the target this time.  You might be the target next time.  Fair skinned people and red-head burn faster in the sun and are therefore 50% more likely to develop skin cancer.  So, if we come to your workplace and do not find sun screen on your skin, we will drop your insurance down.  Do you see how ridicules this is getting.  You may think your not trying to develop a "Master Race", just a less costly one.  I still say, May God Help Those of Us Who Don't Fit Your Mold.

Dear Ms. Walton:



Governor Beverly Perdue’s Office of Community and Citizen Services recently contacted the State Health Plan (the Plan) with your email concerning the Plan's new Comprehensive Wellness Initiative (CWI).  As the Customer Relations Department, we would like to provide the following Plan information in response to your inquiry:



This initiative was developed to encourage Plan members to make healthier lifestyle choices. It also provides supports to assist Plan members to quit using tobacco and maintain a healthy weight. The goal of CWI is to engage members in managing their health more effectively, while saving money for themselves, the Plan and taxpayers in the process.

Healthcare costs continue to rise nationally and in North Carolina. Chronic diseases account for costly health problems and 70% of deaths in the U.S., and yet, they are mostly preventable.

To prevent or control chronic disease, recommendations include:

§ Stop using tobacco,

§ Eat nutritious meals/snacks,

§ Maintain a healthy weight, and

§ Engage in regular physical activity



The CWI applies to active employees, retirees, COBRA participants and dependents whose primary health coverage is provided by the Plan. The CWI does not apply to members with Medicare or other health insurance as their primary coverage.

At the time of testing, you will be asked if you qualify for an exemption based on participation in a program or due to a medical condition. If so, the testing vendor will give you a Physician Certification Form to complete and submit to the screening vendor, by fax or mail, within fifteen (15) business days from the day of testing. The form must verify that participation in a cessation or weight management program occurred prior to the testing date, or that you have a medical condition that prevents attainment of the required BMI. The form must also be signed and dated by the physician, and you must complete the “member section” in order for the form to be considered “complete.” If the completed form is returned to the testing vendor by the deadline, you will remain in the Standard 80/20 Plan.

The Plan offers you a variety of weight management resources and tools, including:

§ Four (4) nutritional counseling visits per year for all members beginning January 1, 2010

§ Prescription Medications with lower copayment amounts beginning January 1, 2010

§ NC HealthSmart Health Coaching 1-800-817-7044

§ <http://www.shpnc.org/worksite-wellness.html>Worksite Wellness programs and materials



As long as you submit an exemption based on participation in a weight management program or due to a medical condition, you will remain in the Standard 80/20 Plan.



Please direct any questions about the Comprehensive Wellness Initiative to the Customer Services Department at 1-888-234-2416. In December, you will receive the PharmacyWise newsletter which will outline enhanced benefits and other NC HealthSmart resources for members.

The State Health Plan appreciates your ongoing input as we seek to fulfill our mission “to provide quality health care products and services for your health and wellbeing.”

Subject: State Teacher Health Insurance in 2011

Comment: I read a letter from our State Insurance plan last night that informed me of a new program coming in 2011 that would lower my Health Insurance for 80/20 to 70/30 because I am over weight. In my life I have done every diet and even had Gastic Bypass surgery to loose weight. In 2000 I weighed 386 pounds and have lost over 100 pounds and can't seem to get any lower. I would even consider the lap band if the doctors would do it, but since I had half of my intenstines removed due to colon cancer in 2006, I am not a candidate. When I read this last night I looked at my husband and said, "We have to move back to Ohio or else I will need to get a new profession." I can't go with poor or no insurance. I will not allow myself to die if my cancer returns because I can't afford my medication or services. Yes Chemo is covered, but not all the tests that are run to keep one step ahead of the cancer. This takes us one-step closer to a national break down of individual's rights and the ability of insurance companies to deny services due to a person's genetic make-up. We as a people will soon be able to weed out those whose DNA is not one of a "Master Race". Does that sound familiar to anyone. May God Help Those of Us Who Don't Fit Your Mold.

Subject: Thank you for supporting HB 2

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Thank you for showing a commitment to protecting the health and well-being of the citizens of North Carolina through your support of House Bill 2, Prohibit Smoking in Certain Public Places. I am looking forward to January 2, 2010 when all restaurants and bars in North Carolina become smoke-free. This is a great step in the right direction toward protecting North Carolina's workers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Once HB 2 becomes law, 69% of the workforce, or nearly 2.8 million North Carolina workers, will be protected by smoke-free policies. In addition, millions more North Carolinians will be protected from short-term exposure when spending time in our restaurants and bars. Studies have shown that smoke-free laws can reduce deaths and hospital admissions due to heart attack by 20%; in North Carolina, this would translate to more than 4,000 admissions and 800 deaths due to heart attacks. This will save us more than $15 million in health care costs. More than 395,000 North Carolina bar and restaurant workers will be able to go to work knowing that their hearts and lungs are protected by smoke-free policies. Your support of HB 2 shows commitment to improving health and saving lives. Thank you for standing up for the right to breathe smoke-free air. Sincerely, Richard Chandler 906 Pridemore Ct Fayetteville, NC 28303-5672 (910) 867-7889

Thank you for cleaning up Wake County.  I have lived in Wake County since 1991 and in NC all of my life, and I love it!  However, under past leadership I have noticed that trash pick-up on the side of the road all but stopped.  There were times when there was so much trash on the sides of the road that I would become depressed about our state.



Under your leadership, I have not had any days like that.  I am proud of you and what you are doing to keep NC beautiful.



Thank you Governor!

I am really disappointed in your response to this problem. I think you have inflamed an issue which is a legal matter that needs to be addressed with thoughtful deliberation. I didn't vote for you to be just another "good old boy" who flexes macho muscles. try to do better! Anne Thomas

I  think you made a good move in the early release of lifers,   The legal system is in a shambles, Why then  does the DOC continue to build  top security prisons   when they don't intend to keep the serious offenders there. Another waste of tax payers money.  I guess we are returning to the days of the  old west   where everyone had to protect themselves.  Sad when the Criminals have more rights than the victims.    I  think you are doing a great job, I have meet other great ladies if given a chance they  would do the  same.

Gov Perdue's pandering on this issue is shameless and cliche.  Not what I voted for.  Do something about the economy rather than beating up on prisoners.  If I'd wanted that, I could have voted Republican.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release
Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.
Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.
While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.
At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.
 Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.
 Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose



When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Thank you.   Hang tough, please.    "Life" should mean for the rest of one's life on this planet.    There should be no "good behavior credits".    They were convicted and sentenced for violent crimes.   Those crimes should never be excused nor pardoned because of a moment of good behavior.
Please do not release these criminals.

Well done, Governor!  This ruling by the Supreme Court is going to cost a wad of money for the state to attempt to fix, where as, if the original sentences were left in place, those costs would not be incurred.  Let me also state that I am a firm  believer in the death penalty and believe that these kinds of criminals will never contribute to the community in any possible manner. and to house, feed, and pamper them in prison is wasteful and a drain on the same community they have offended.  Why do we feel the need to "store" these kinds of maniacs?

Subject: THE "20"

Comment: Thank you, Governor Perdue, for taking prompt action to keep The "20" off our streets for the near future anyway. I find it appalling that DOC would even consider release without further legal investigation. I will support you in any action you feel necessary. I think this is also a good time to start discussions on changing out state laws to incarcerate for life without parole pedophiles and everyone convicted of sexually assaulting a child. We must stop the violence however we can whenever we can. Thank you again, Governor.

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Southeast Governors Announce Formation of a South Atlantic Alliance

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.

The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

“All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”

This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Hi, my name is Theresa Hill and I just want to say HOOORAH to the governor for not letting these harden criminals out. I agree with the governor, if their  sentences were for life then they should serve it for life.

Madam Governor;

Thank you for your quick action in preventing these dangerous Inmates from being released back into society.  I know of no one that would want them released especially if they knew why they were incarcerated for Life.

I am, as always, at your service;

> Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:

> When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

> Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

> While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

> At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

> Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

> Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

> The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.

> The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

> “All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”

> This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

> All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

I'm very pleased with your decision on this,I agree,life means life.But on another subject,I would ask that you give some thought to involuntary annexation and ban them from our state.Municipalities use this as a tax grab,and the affected residents are the ones who suffer.As bad as the economy these days and the importance of saving every dollar,municipalites should be made to stop taking in land just for a tax base.If you get a chance I truly hope that you give this some consideration.Thanks for your time.

Thank you for working to keep these criminals  in prison and stopping 
their early release.  Life should mean life or certainly more than 
thirty five years.  Thank you for taking a stand in this serious

still be incarcerated.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release
Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable. 
Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities. 
While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Courtâ€™s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard. 
At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.
 Mr. Bowdenâ€™s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.
 Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Governor Perdue,

Thank you for being so diligent in researching the legal issues surrounding this court ruling. I am all for reducing
the prison population when individuals are serving sentences resulting from minor offenses where life and property were not involved.

I don't believe rapists and murderers fall into that category. In fact, if any such individual was released and killed or raped another person, that would be a terrible burden to bear.

Respectfully,

R. Ivey

Thank you for your efforts to prevent the release of  "Life termers" in prison.

My question is this!
 When did YOU first learn of the NC Supreme Court's ruling? and why are you just now attempting to prohibit the release of these prisoners?

Respectfully submitted,

Southeast Governors Announce Formation of a South Atlantic Alliance

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.
The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after they’ve been struck by natural disasters.
The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.
“All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations,” said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. “This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.”
This Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.
All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the South’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Governor,

Good for you and thank you!

We may disagree on some things, but on this issue you are absolutely correct.

What can I do to help keep these bad people in jail?

Dear Governor Perdue:  Thank you for your recent action regarding making sure prisoners with life sentences will stay in prison.  One of the best ways to reduce death sentences is to assure juries that prisoners given life will actually get life.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose



When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.  

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.  

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Courtâ€™s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.  

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees.

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:

> When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

> Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

> While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

> At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:
When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.
Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.
While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Court’s decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.
At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s.

This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.
Mr. Bowden’s case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.
Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.
