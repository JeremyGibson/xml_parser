I hope the Department of Health/Human Services in North Carolina can reconsider what I hear is a decision no longer to support the Drug Effectiveness Review Program, via the Center for Evidence-based Practice at the Oregon Health and Sciences University.  The "DERP" is one of the most effective and useful programs that North Carolina has supported -- providing unparalleled information useful for Medicaid and S-CHIP, about the comparative benefits and harms of medications that might be used for populations covered by those state insurance programs.  Especially with new monies coming to the state for the stimulus, this is no time for North Carolina not to participate fully in a highly successful program.  Please see the attached for further information.

Thank you!

Subject: Charlotte Mecklenburg Elementary School layoffs

Comment: My sister is a School Psycologist in the CMSD. They were told today that all Elementary School psycologists will be laid off at the end of the school year. The CMSD Superintendant is going to Washington to find out how the money will be allocated. The same article stated that he will continue with the layoff plans until this is addressed. You said education was a priority. I contend that the School psycologists are just as important and iraplaceable as the teachers. They have to meet stricter guidelins and make judgement calls when it comes the the mental/physical state of the children. They also conduct mandatory testing and evaluations of students. Governer Perdue can you please intervene in this matter. Thank you for your attention. Raymond Kornfeld

Subject: ABC Stores- Sunday

Comment: Is it true that you are considering having ABC stores open on Sunday? If this is a consideration of your office I would like to log my discontentment with this idea. Could the sabbath just not remain sacred by efforts to decrease the possible incidents of drinking and driving. If revenue is the issue lets tax that which hurts as you have with cigarettes. One more day is access to that which hurts in ways such as domestic violence, drinking and driving and in support of alcoholism. I am happy to pay tolls on our highways to raise the needed funds, not open ABC stores. Governor, Just Say NO! Chik-fil-A is a highly profitable company that has remained faithful to being closed on Sunday, lets get on board.

Subject: environmental education

Comment: Governor Perdue, I read today that your proposed budget eliminates the office of environmental education. I have 3 concerns: (1) I thought this office was funded with grant monies, not taxpayer money. Am I mistaken? (2) It seems that eliminating environmental education is working against our nation's efforts to develop a more "green economy." (3) I would rather see a cut made openly and transparently than to suggest that transfering the function to another department without funds or personnel to carry it out would somehow soften the blow. Such a suggestion is a dishonest misrepresentation of reality, and I would applaud your bravery if you let the act stand on its own. If the office of environmental education is taxpayer funded, then perhaps if the cut is made openly a private organization will see the loss, recognize the need, and provide funding to continue it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. May you be given wisdom for the many hard decisions you must make. Sincerely, Elizabeth P. Massey General Music Teacher Moore County Schools

Comment: I have been very upset over the head-lines splashed all over the tv concerning the lack of support of many dems who are publicly criticizing Obama's budget package. I worked very hard to elect dems and voted for Obama,s vision for getting us through these difficult times. Many dems rode to victory on the president's coat-tail and this stance seems to be a slap in his face. Please support the president in any way possible and I would greatly appreciate it. I am a retired school teacher and would like to put in a plug for education also. Thank you for your time. A loyal dem who wants all senators, reps,and governors to work together. Ann B. Neal

Subject: any tax increases

Comment: I am writing to beg that any increase in taxes will be reconsidered. We are now struggling to keep our home. It's really difficult just to eat, heat and anything else needed to survive. Now I hear tolls on the roads are being considered. Where does it end for people like us. Earning 25,000.00 a year doesn't go far and increasing expenses on the people are going to destroy us. Anticipating tax increases on petrol, cap and trade will also increase utilities, again when will this end???

There is not a day t6hat I don't get into a near miss situation with someone who is not paying attention on the road because they are busy talking on the phone. Help me, Save me and many others who have to share the road with these inconsiderate people. Impose a $250 fine on anyone caught speaking on their cell phones or even worse texting while driving

Subject: Medicare costs

Comment: My mother is on Medicare, is diabetic and can receive a new pair of shoes yearly. I was horrified to learn that a pair of shoes with 4 sets of insoles cost $285.00 (our tax money) and of course, they are made in China. They are as light as sneakers and have plastic injected molded bottoms with stitched uppers. Surely we can make a pair of shoes for diabetics in North Carolina at a lower cost. How about using some of that stimulus money for a shoe factory in Hickory that targets diabetics, and seek government contracts for Medicare products? I'll bet we could make better products, less expensively, put some of our unemployed people to work earning decent wages, and still save Medicare a boat load of money. Respectfully, Penny Smith

Subject: Education - School and academic libraries

Comment: Honorable Governor: with all due respect--I find it hypocritical and disingenuous of this office to feature advocacy for education ON THE HOME PAGE of the website while you put, in a line item in your budget, cuts to libraries! Libraries ARE education, particularly school and college/academic libraries--do you not know the difference between all the various libraries??? I find your actions are harmful, short-sighted and ill informed and your verbal support of education therefore spurious. As a Democrat who voted for you--I am very angry and disappointed--you have betrayed your mandate, your supporters and your constituency who believed your words and your stated mission to support education, students and teachers--and in the school and college setting, librarians ARE teachers and integral to a learning effort that teaches information literacy and higher order thinking skills, life-long learning and the ability to participate as informed citizenry in the democratic process. Please honor your commitment and do not undercut and undermine educational institutions in North Carolina by defunding their libraries. Thank you, Kimberley Balcos

Subject: The Budget and Rocky Mount, NC

Comment: Just curious! But why does it seem that Raleigh, Charlotte and all these other places get National Guard Headquarters causing 4000 jobs and Rocky Mount, NC doesn't ever get crap! It seems Raleigh alway's gets the top priorty and the other smaller towns never ever get any benefits. My husband along with others in my town are suffering because of job loses and he is to old for National Guard. Plus with gas prices and the wear and tear on our cars, Raleigh is just to far to drive. Why are things not getting spread out equally where everybody benefits. It seems like you are following Governor Mike Easley's trail of Governing and in my opinion he was a lousy Governor. All he ever thought about was buying up National Parks spending lavishly and Education. And you are doing the same crap! It's all about the areas that you guys live in and not all about the other counties! Not once has our Mayor in Rocky Mount mentioned anything about getting our town better! So what does Rocky Mount have in store as far as this stupid budget goes? Nothing! And taxing the cigarettes that way you all did violates my rights! I am not a drug addict and feel like I am being punished for smoking. The rules on smoking have really gotten out of hand all because a bunch of you hate the smell! That's okay! I will grow tobacco in my garden this year and roll them up to smoke before you get a dime from me with your so called tax. I personally would have rather seen a tax hike on everything by a few pennies where everybody would pay equally. Instead you so called Communist Bastards seem to want to control the Americans and take away their freedom and own personal enjoyments. Here we have millions of cars passing our Interstate Highways every year from different States and in order to get through their state they have to pay Tolls. State of Delaware charges $4.00 just to pass their State. Why not charge the outsiders going through our states on the busiest highways and make Revenue for our State helping us that live here by decreasing the Taxes. All I here is Budget, budget budget but not thinking out making Revenue for our State that would better benefit us all. Lowering our taxes, creating more highway jobs by having the travelers that go to Florida every year passing our roads and tearing up our highways. Right now as far as I see! I see a bunch of smoke being blown up the North Carolina Citizens tails and you guys seem to think we are stupid enough to believe that you are doing your jobs when in fact I see a bunch of hogwash! You guys won't be seeing my vote unless I see improvements~! Sincerely, Linda Huggins

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Karen Ryden 2201 Tallon Hall Ct Raleigh, NC 27607-7404

Subject: NC Quiz Bowl

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am an eighth grade NC History Teacher for Kannapolis City Schools. This past fall I was notified that the Department of Cultural Resources needed to cancell the annual 8th Grade NC Quiz Bowl. My students and school community were very upset. This was a fine program that allowed kids who often are not involved in other school activities, to become excited about NC state History. We had not always been a great team but recently we had been making it to the State Championship rounds and that success created even more enthusiasm at our school. You speak often that education is very important to your administration and you will encourage growth in educational opportunities. Please show us this support by finding a way to fund this awesome program in next years budget! I look forward to hearing from you concerning this issue. Sincerly, Doug Byrnes Kannapolis Middle School (704) 932-4102 (w) (704) 763-8649 (h)

Subject: Classroom size

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I attended grade school and high school with class sizes of 35-50 students, sometimes with 2 grades in one classroom, with no teacher aides. I cannot believe that today's teachers are incapable of handling 1 or 2 more students per class. We have areas in the state where teachers are needed, so there shouldn't be any lay-offs. It's about good education and good teachers, more money, more money, more money!

Subject: health care and solution to shortage of teachers

Comment: I am a retired teacher/counselor and am not making much money under your retirement system I was absolutely floored when I saw Tony Rands solution for our health plan.It would make it the worst in the nation. Please help us. Dont reduce our benefits by 1300 dollars. As for the teacher shortage, put the supervisors in the local central offices back in the classroom and do away with double dipping by retired teachers. You dont have a shortage anymore. I still feel sick when I see what Tony Rand has done As for one extra child in the classroom that wouldnt make any difference. When I first started teaching I had 36 students in a combination classroom and no assistant. Thanks for letting me express my concern

Subject: Thank You for Choosing Health

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Thank you for making the health of North Carolinians your priority! The proposed significant increases in tobacco taxes will deliver the maximum health and economic benefits for North Carolina by preventing kids from smoking, helping smokers quit and generating millions on new revenue for the state. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in North Carolina, claiming more than 12,000 lives each year and costing the state $2.46 billion annually in health care bills, including $769 million in Medicaid payments alone. Government expenditures related to tobacco amount to a hidden tax of $578 each year on every North Carolina household. Currently, 19% of North Carolina high school students smoke, and 11,800 more kids become regular smokers every year. You have shown true leadership by taking this bold step to create a healthier North Carolina. Together we can reduce tobacco use, save lives and raise revenue - it's a win-win-win for all! Sincerely, Lynn Elliott 2614 Woodmont Dr Durham, NC 27705-2760

Subject: NC Government Spending

Comment: Just a thought but if the NC State Goverment would spend the millions that it spends out of state to North Carolina companies and small businesses that provide the same products and services wouldn't that help both the state and local economies through out North Carolina. In some cases even if the cost was higher the money still remains in the state and at some point gets paid back to the state in taxes (actually several times - employment tax, sales tax, property tax etc etc) it's almost like the state gives all it's money back to the state.

Subject: early education

Comment: Governor Perdue, I have worked in early education - what we have always called child care for a really long time and I've watched us struggle to create a system - a veritable patchwork quilt of services - the Division of Child Development, SmartStart, Child Care Resources and Referral, Head Start, Professional Development, Even Start, Child Care Health Consultants, More at Four, the Office of School Readiness and many others -Prevent Blindness - Community Partnerships - Motheread - and so on and so on. This question is troubling me. The group that first addressed the work we do as early education was the Office of School Readiness with DPI affiliation. Research tells us that education does not magically begin at age 5 or even age 4, but long before that. So here's the question: What would happen if DPI brought all these early education services into the fold? So many jobs in NC are created by early education, but many of the jobs that are currently created do not provide liveable wages. Many of theses jobs come with no insurance, no retirement savings, no annual leave and no sick leave. Teachers who teach and care for Doctors' children, cannot take their own children to those very same doctors - cannot even stay home to take care of them when they are sick, cannot stay home themselves when they are sick. Infant and toddler classroom cannot meet standards. There are too many infants for one person to physically meet their needs - much less be concerned about what these youngest citizens are learning. The quilt just isn't working. Is it possible that all these agencies could be folded into the education system? I know that our education is not perfect - maybe they could learn to edu-care.... (Magda Gerber) Do you think it's possible that the educators could learn that teaching requires relationship and the early educators could learn that relationship without plans and goals misses tremendous opportunity? Could we develop an education system that is based on competencies and disposition and credentials? I hope the answer is yes. No one systemizes like the school system - for better or for worse. I hope the question is worth asking. Sincerely, debi
