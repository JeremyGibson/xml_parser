Kelley,
I believe this is just a legislative issue that she has.  She is making suggestions on changing the law and her husband is not currently eligible to apply for a pardon.

The Honorable Beverly Perdue

Governor for this Great State of North Carolina,



First Governor, allow me to extend my congratulations to a most successful campaign. As you stated on many occasions, while campaigning across this state; “It takes all of us to make it work.”



While your tenure has only begun, it is truly refreshing to see you come out in favor of an open and inclusive government as exemplified in the January 14th Raleigh News and Observer article “That’s an order”.” Perdue also signed orders to post state grants and contracts on a central Web site. That's another good public access idea, along with town hall meetings, four of them, during her term. And Perdue was consistent in her campaign in vowing to open state records and conduct business in the open, which wasn't always the case with former Gov. Mike Easley.”



It is very frustrating when one knows of a true injustice and can’t seem to get anyone to just look at it unbiased. This is especially true, when considering our present economic state of affairs. Fulfilling the need list should always prioritize the wish list of special interest.



Governor I’m attaching some points for study on my concerns; I truly recognize how busy you are but strongly feel this is deserving of considerations and study by your task force. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if I can answer any question or be of service in any way.



Respectfully,



Steven F. Shell

It’s not county. It’s Administrative Office of the Courts. They are not subject to the State Personnel Act. If what she wants is a job, I can send her a reply about that. If what she wants is to complain about her former supervisor, it needs to go to AOC. Your call.

Kelley,
He asks this question -  "Are there any laws that might soon give a felon a second chance? Especially those that haven't committed any crimes in years and it having been their first offense. This was my first and only felony offense."
Wouldn't that be a legislative issue?

> Hi Bev Perdue,
> 
> I'll be quite frank with you Bev, when I was younger, 20, I was quite naive. I never thought that one mistake could endure the rest of my days. I was about 20 years old, and I was living with my mother, a registered nurse in Carolina Beach. The only thing I enjoyed was having fun and partying with my friends. I never thought about the future because I thought I could put it off until later. Well the sad thing is my mother kicked me out of her house. She set me up in a little apartment on Carolina Beach. Well one night I was trying to sleep so I could wake up to go look for a job so I could survive on my own when Tim Reid, Angela Reid, and Robert Pridgeon showed up unexpectedly and asked me to help them with a wicked plot. Tim wanted to kill his parents because he didn't want to go to prison for forging their checks. Although at the time I thought life hopeless I wasn't crazy enough to engage in the plot. I was young and naive at the time, but I did the right thing. I told them that I wouldn't help. As they were all leaving Bobby Pridgen took my car keys from the coffee table and said they were taking my car.
> 
> Sure enough I didn't want them taking my car, so I acted like I was going along with it. As a result, being the fool that I was, I ended up driving them to the Reids' house. Tim broke into the house once there, and I started trying to talk them out of it. In the end, I ran out of the house and hopped in my car after the dog started barking, and the others followed. To make a long story short, we were caught driving out of the Pine Valley housing section. As a result, I ended up believing a court appointed lawyer, and thinking that I should plead guilty to the crime. In court I stood up and said that I didn't intend to kill the Reids'. After having signed the plea bargain waiver for an old-law 10 year sentence, I served a 10 year sentence in about 4 years. To be honest one of the main factors in my signing it was the drive to get out of the county jail.
> 
> Sadly enough, in the current digital age I might as well have the word 'Felon' stamped to my head. Since I was released in 1998 I obtained a 2 year degree in computer engineering and a 4 year degree in information systems. I'm also doing pretty well considering that I'm monitoring the operations of a call center that houses about 400 Internet technicians. Most importantly, I'm staying out of trouble (the worst trouble I've been in was getting speeding and a seat belt tickets).
> 
> So I was wondering, there must be a way to fix this issue. Working with the court system seems impossible considering that all of the elements needed to withdraw a plea seem to be waived in the plea agreement. It seems to me that it should be due process for a judge to throw out a plea given that conspiracy to commit murder requires 'intent' of the defendent to commit the crime and that obviously I didn't really understand the nature of the offense that I was pleading to or I wouldn't have been saying I didn't intend to kill the Reids' while I was pleading guilty. Are there any laws that might soon give a felon a second chance? Especially those that haven't committed any crimes in years and it having been their first offense. This was my first and only felony offense.

I hope the Department of Health/Human Services in North Carolina can reconsider what I hear is a decision no longer to support the Drug Effectiveness Review Program, via the Center for Evidence-based Practice at the Oregon Health and Sciences University.  The "DERP" is one of the most effective and useful programs that North Carolina has supported -- providing unparalleled information useful for Medicaid and S-CHIP, about the comparative benefits and harms of medications that might be used for populations covered by those state insurance programs.  Especially with new monies coming to the state for the stimulus, this is no time for North Carolina not to participate fully in a highly successful program.  Please see the attached for further information.

Thank you!

Please send this reply out via your email account?

Dear Mr. Lopez,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the Governor's Teacher Advisory Committee (GTAC).

GTAC is a small group of teacher leaders who are currently teaching in public schools in North Carolina.  This committee was first established via Executive order under Governor Jim Hunt, continued through Governor Easley, and now Governor Perdue plans to ask this group to provide her with advice on the challenges and successes of our classrooms today. The Governor appoints all 18 members who represent a diverse background in grade and subject levels. The members are appointed for 2 year terms and they are staggered terms so that no more than 3-4 members term out at any one time.

You can be placed on the list to be considered by submitting a one page resume to our office.  Include  your numbers of years in the classroom, which school(s) and district(s), subject areas, etc. and any leadership  work where you have played an integral part.

Please send your information to me at the address below. If selected, you will be contacted by the Boards and Commissions office.

Sincerely,


Ann McArthur
Teacher Advisor to Governor Perdue

> Comment: My son is now 14 years old and has been tormented in Wake County Public Schools for the past 9 years. From K-7, he attended 7 different schools. He was not taught to read in Kindergarten because the Spec Ed teacher decided he was "uneducable" and it was not worthwhile to work on academic instruction. I bought Hooked on Phonics and within 6 weeks he was reading at a 1st grade 7 month level. My son is gifted in math and science and has made A's in mainstream classes; however, I have had to teach him at home because the teachers would not work with him. My son has been physically and psychologically abused by both staff and students during his years in the school system and I removed him last May because the school administrators told me that if he ran away from school again, they would chase him, tackle him and put him in handcuffs. He was running away because of the physical abuse that they told me they couldn't prove was happening because no one involved would admit what they did to him. They said that his injuries could have been self inflicted. I sued the school system in 2002 and the case was finally heard in 2005 - the school system is allowed to delay hearing for years and during that time the school puts pressure on the family to drop the suit. When it was clear to them that I wouldn't drop the suit, the school system finally placed my son with a teacher who actually followed the law and provided an appropriate program. He was with this teacher for 2 years and had no behavior problems during that time. His teacher loved him and my son thrived in the program she organized for him. This program was not extravagant and, although I cannot get the financial details from the school system, I would bet that the two years my son was in this appropriate program cost far less than any other single year he spent in an inappropriate program. Doing the right thing cost less. I was able to focus on my job and earned a promotion that brought our income up so that I could provide more services for my son. He was not stressed everyday at school so his doctor took him off medication and his physical health and overall wellbeing improved - it was a much needed period of stability in what had been a tumultuous life because of the issues at school. There are children suffering in our school system every day and it is not in the interest of the citizens of this state to allow the harm to continue. It cost more now and will cost an incredible amount in the future as these children age out of the school system and don't have even basic skills to maintain any level of independent living. I would like to speak with someone about this serious issue that needs and warrants immediate attention. Plese help us. Cheryl Everette

Eduminder is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide FREE internet based administrative, educational and student tools for primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The tools will also provide a platform for collaboration and information sharing among schools across districts, nations, continents and cultures. I am asking you to help us with the following: 1. Support Eduminder with a initial funding, and assistance obtaining additional funding 2. Introduce Eduminder to School Superintendents and Administrators, as awareness and support is critical, and finally 3. Assist Eduminder in “spreading the word” in Washington and among your fellow Governors – your direct involvement and advocacy is extremely important. The global economic downturn, and resulting school budget cuts and closings, is making the support for Eduminder even more critical: Eduminder is an essential solution at this time. Time is running out. The impact of the school budget cuts will be felt this fall if not sooner. Your support is greatly appreciated and needed, for together we will make a difference. Please feel free to contact me should you wish more information about Eduminder. I appreciate your time and consideration. Best regards, Rolf Heitmann Eduminder Telephone: +1 401.354.2625 x9520 Facsimile: +1 401.682.2846 http://www.Eduminder.org/

Comment: So you are now duplicating the Superintendent's duties? How much will this duplication cost? What does the General Assembly think of this? If you can erase one elected office, what's to stop you from erasing another? You are in effect ignoring the state constitution while wasting money.

DRAFT RESPONSE



Dear Mr. Young,



Thank you for your email inquiry regarding public school construction.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.

We are facing unprecedented economic times in our state and across the country.  The Governor is committed to protecting the classroom as much as possible during these uncertain times, but she has stated that with the economy the way it is, it will be difficult for everyone. 



On March 17th, Governor Perdue released her proposed 2009-2010 budget.  One of the key points to note is there will be no reductions, redirections or transfers of any lottery or corporate income tax receipts from the Public School Building Capital Fund. You can view the budget in it’s entirety at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/> www.governor.state.nc.us .  You can also view key education budget points here:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=213> http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=213

 In the State of the State Address, Governor Perdue stated that even in this troubled economic environment she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Education, Governor Perdue stressed, will be the state’s top priority and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.



On March 17th, Governor Perdue released her proposed 2009-2010 budget.  You can view it in it’s entirety at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/> www.governor.state.nc.us . You will note that there is a proposal to suspend longevity pay for all state employees for two years. There is also the federal stimulus money that will assist as the budget is refined in the coming months in the legislature.

Subject: Teachers

Comment: I never heard back about how Governor Purdue is going to help the 1496 contract teachers not lose their jobs. I have a simple solution. I would put a 1 year freeze on raises this year. As an employee of a business, I know that is terrible, but I do not think it is a good practice to give the tenure teachers a salary increase while 1496 contract employees lose their jobs. This will cost NC more money in unemployment, medical for the uninsured, etc. So for one year, the salary schedule should be frozen so that the money could be used to save the jobs of the contract employees. I would like to hear why this is not an option I have heard about? Why is this not a part of the 2009 budget. Thanks

Subject: CMS Job Cuts

Comment: To the office staff of Governor Perdue: I am currently a teacher in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system. I would like to know how your office is handling the budget cuts for educators in our school system. I heard at the CMS board meeting that 456 teachers will lose their jobs and 83 assistant principals as well. I am very confused by this. CMS has been talking about teacher shortages and recruiting heavily in the northern states in the past years. Teachers and their families relocated to Charlotte to start a new life and now their jobs may be in jeopardy. Will the stimulus money help our teachers keep their jobs? As a member of NCAE and a NC teacher, we elected you Governor Perdue to help educators in North Carolina. What are doing to help us? Sincerely, S. Hilton

Comment: I am concerned that government is tearing down the school system instead of building it up. How can you say there is a need for teachers when you are going to lay them off? How can you take money that has been put in place for education and use it else where? How can you say you are working to improve education when you are constantly taking away from the education system? The schools should not have to go through lay offs or cutbacks. Children should be coming first. Not last. Our children will never be competative if you don't give them the tools needed to survive. You have done everything to push the roads and transit system. That is good, but if it comes at the expense of our children, I can live without out an above ground rail or a complete loop around the city. I'm sure there are other areas that can be looked at or can stand cutbacks. I'm simply asking and begging you to please put children first and give them what they need to be leaders in this world.

Comment: I live in Chatham County. The local BOE is currently trying to cut approx. 2.5 million dollars from our county schools budget as directed by the state. One of the primary ways they are considering is by reducing the number of teachers thus increasing the student/teacher ratios. In the Governor's state of the state address she stated education funding would not be subject to the deep cuts seen in other departments. The proposed 09/10 school year budget is available at www.chatham.k12.nc.us. Could you please explain. Thanks Kate Scott

We are facing unprecedented economic times in our state and across the country.  The Governor is committed to protecting the classroom as much as possible during these uncertain times, but she has stated that with the economy the way it is, it will be difficult for everyone. 



On March 17th, Governor Perdue released her proposed 2009-2010 budget.  One of the key points to note is there will be no reductions, redirections or transfers of any lottery or corporate income tax receipts from the Public School Building Capital Fund. You can view the budget in it’s entirety at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us .  You can also view key education budget points here:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=213> http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=213

Subject: Cutting out school construction

Comment: Dear. Mrs. Perdue, I am a citizen in Eden, NC and my daughter goes to Draper Elementary School - the school was built sometime in the 1930's. They have a great staff however, the school is much need of a new facility. At the school board meeting we were in formed by Dr. Shotwell that the money that we had planned to use for construction that would have began this summer is not non exisiting. According to him it has been put into the general fund and not taken out of the "Educational" lottery (which is a another topic). Anyway, on your website you state the following: "Even in this troubled economic environment, Gov. Perdue said, she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools. Education, Gov. Perdue stressed, will be the state’s top priority and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms. “We must, as the saying goes, ‘not eat our seed corn,’ but continue to move forward on education to keep North Carolina competitive in the global marketplace,” Gov. Perdue said. “Yes, even in these tough times we will increase per-pupil spending in our public schools.” “Education is the engine that propels North Carolina’s future. It cannot be sacrificed,” Gov. Perdue said. “This is the time to stand up to the sweet seduction of special interests, the temptations of politically popular pork barrel spending, and end the practice of backroom dealing.”" It is amazing to me how you say that you want to invest in public schools and the education - but when a building that is over 70 years old and is falling apart - that does not create a great working enviroment for our students nor a safe place for them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reconsider funding the schools in Rockingham County - we 3 other schools that need your help. I understand that we are hard economic times but that is not any reason to take away from the "Education" lottery to help fund a mess that was not created by the citizens who pay taxes. Respectfully, Janet Woodall

Dear Mr. Dockery,



Thank you for your email inquiry regarding teaching positions in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



We are facing unprecedented economic times in our state and across the country.  The Governor is committed to protecting the classroom as much as possible during these uncertain times, but she has stated that with the economy the way it is, it will be difficult for everyone. 



 In the State of the State Address, Governor Perdue stated that even in this troubled economic environment she will focus on job creation and retention, retraining for those who have lost their jobs and investing in the public schools.  Education, Governor Perdue stressed, will be the state’s top priority and said there will be increased funding for the work that goes on in public school classrooms.



On March 17th, Governor Perdue released her proposed 2009-2010 budget.  You can view it in it’s entirety at:  <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>www.governor.state.nc.us . The Governor's budget does not lay off any teachers or teacher assistants. Additionally, just this week she sent the (attached) letter to local school boards, explaining that with her budget,  along with the federal stimulus funding, there should not be any teaching positions cut.  Please see the attached files for details.



There is also the federal stimulus money that will assist as the budget is refined in the coming months in the legislature. And, as you may be aware, local school districts make decisions about assignments among classrooms within the school and it will be very important that teachers and community members in the local school districts help monitor the use of the federal dollars to ensure that no teaching positions are cut.



 I encourage you to discuss your school’s needs with your principal and other local school officials and to monitor the budget process once the General Assembly begins work in the coming weeks.  You may check on this daily by visiting <http://www.ncleg.net/> www.ncleg.net.

Subject: Schools!?

Comment: Governor Perdue: I'm a member of your voting public and want to hear more of your thoughts about the state of affairs with Charlotte-Mecklenburgs schools. We've got school board members who favor middle school sports over keeping teachers in the classroom. That means increased class size and a lower quality of instruction all to save our precious middle school sports. What are we going to do about this? If NC has any hope of surviving in the future we're going to have to make the only "sure investment" around these days - the education of our future leaders. We've also got people in favor of saving their precious CMS-TV channel over keeping qualified teachers in the classroom. CMS-TV is an outdated and useless way of communicating with today's tech-minded public. Please use your power to tell our board members and leaders that we need to keep teachers in the classrooms, cut the fat and get down to business. We shouldn't even be considering cutting teachers before middle school sports and school district tv channels. Best regards, Steven Dockery

Comment: I am a new teacher who is really scared that I will lose my job due to the cuts that the state is having. But in listening to the Gov.'s speech and President Obama's speech, both talk about that education is the future, but it is hard to have your mind fully focused on your students when you hear about job cuts. What are you doing to help us starting teachers keep from worrying about our jobs and let us worry about our students?

Subject: Teachers

Comment: My wife is a dance teacher and has been for 3 years with Wake County. On top of teaching for the past 3 years, she has been going to school to get her teaching license(get in with lateral entry). We are very worried that she will be losing her job after this year b/c of the cutbacks. What if anything is Govenor Purdue doing to help teachers like my wife keep their jobs. Their are many ways to cut costs and save jobs. One being(as much as I hate to say this) freeze the pay increase for 1 year, until the economy turns around next year. It seems like a bad idea to give teachers (or anyone) raises while possible almost 1500 employees are terminated! Where I work, we all cut our hours a little to avoid layoffs. It is not good but better than familes being out a job, insurance,etc. I would love to hear what Govenor Purdue is doing to save these jobs. I have always been a Republican and did not vote for Govenor Purdue. However, if I see she has the ability to safe jobs for my wife and other families in a environment like this, she would have my support. Thanks

Comment: My sister is a School Psycologist in the CMSD. They were told today that all Elementary School psycologists will be laid off at the end of the school year. The CMSD Superintendant is going to Washington to find out how the money will be allocated. The same article stated that he will continue with the layoff plans until this is addressed. You said education was a priority. I contend that the School psycologists are just as important and iraplaceable as the teachers. They have to meet stricter guidelins and make judgement calls when it comes the the mental/physical state of the children. They also conduct mandatory testing and evaluations of students. Governer Perdue can you please intervene in this matter. Thank you for your attention. Raymond Kornfeld

Comment: Is it true that you are considering having ABC stores open on Sunday? If this is a consideration of your office I would like to log my discontentment with this idea. Could the sabbath just not remain sacred by efforts to decrease the possible incidents of drinking and driving. If revenue is the issue lets tax that which hurts as you have with cigarettes. One more day is access to that which hurts in ways such as domestic violence, drinking and driving and in support of alcoholism. I am happy to pay tolls on our highways to raise the needed funds, not open ABC stores. Governor, Just Say NO! Chik-fil-A is a highly profitable company that has remained faithful to being closed on Sunday, lets get on board.

Subject: The Office of Environmental Education

Comment: Why do you want to close the environmental education office? Boy Scouts use this as part of obtaining merit badge for rank in the troops. More needs to be done for Boy /Girl Scouting in NC. The cost per young adult is climbing and we depend on the state to help. Each year Scouting is becomming a thing of the past. I strongly incourage you to pick up a copy of The Boy Scout book and look what they do. Threw Scouting my son is learning to become a leader in the community. With out Scouting his leafership abilities will not develope. It is a shame that Boy Scouting Celebrates 100 years in 2010 and NC. has done nothing to host a Jamboree for this historic event. I have also contacted Sen. Burr's office to help support Scouting and other programs that NC. should use in schools that already exist. I am a firm believer in NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND. All the push has been to GO GREEN well by cutting out Environmental Education progreess will stop. These are tuff times and tuff measures need to be taken. What i do not hear anyone saying is about crime and prisons. First most of these crimeals are in prison for drug posseion, robbery and so on. Just how many of this inmates are brick masons, carpenters, electrians, plumbers, equipment opperators. Building a school in the charlotte area for example i would use inmates and the Job corps. I would put up a rented chain link fence and ankle locator on an inmate to keep him in line. Use a mobile look out just like the one Char. Meck. uses in parking lots to deter crime. The winning situation is you still have a Contractor on the job who use s a percentage of screened quilified inmates and Job Corps who are training young men and women in these type of Jobs. The people are paying taxes and this is how it goes. In a circle we start with the need for a school or any Gov. Building. Contractor bids job with understanding he has to employe a percentage of inmates and Job Corp personnal. Then Contractor does not have to pay for their labor as an incentive to use inmates or job corp. We already pay taxes for that. The savings come from the amount saved in labor to build any building. Then you areseeing how an inmate peforms and when their poral comes up it would make it easier to decide and poosibly reduce their sentence. More saving comes from not housing that inmate for a longer period of time. Less crime in the state because inmates no they have to work and not have a free ride. To house an inmate is rooughly 25000.00 a year and to house and train people in Job Corp is about the same because in Job Corp we give them a pay check. Don not jump and cut Job Corp because it is a great program for young adults who are dropping out of school. Very high drop out rate in NC. This is a program that needs to be used more by the school systems and quit with the money allotment per child per school. Padding the books is what I see. Police Dept. needs to use the officers at the schools for the explores program to start training young Adults who want to be police officers. JROTC need to put active personnel at the school to training young adults who want to jion the Military. Then you have Boy and Girl Scouts who really have the right moral attitude to produce leaders in the community. More money is not needed it just needs someone to take the bull by the horns and organize it. All of these programs are paid by tax dollars except Scouting. What i am saying is you need to keep kids in school by redirecting them. Drop out become criminals and then that is a burden on the tax payers. Teach them in school about the law and they will police their own in school by peer pressure. Gang activity will disappear. drugs will go away .more children will stay in school less will be in jail taxes will decrease because more people will be in the working feild. Please contact me Thanks Duane

Subject: environmental education

Comment: Governor Perdue, I read today that your proposed budget eliminates the office of environmental education. I have 3 concerns: (1) I thought this office was funded with grant monies, not taxpayer money. Am I mistaken? (2) It seems that eliminating environmental education is working against our nation's efforts to develop a more "green economy." (3) I would rather see a cut made openly and transparently than to suggest that transfering the function to another department without funds or personnel to carry it out would somehow soften the blow. Such a suggestion is a dishonest misrepresentation of reality, and I would applaud your bravery if you let the act stand on its own. If the office of environmental education is taxpayer funded, then perhaps if the cut is made openly a private organization will see the loss, recognize the need, and provide funding to continue it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. May you be given wisdom for the many hard decisions you must make. Sincerely, Elizabeth P. Massey General Music Teacher Moore County Schools

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Kim Carnes 531 Silversmith Ln Charlotte, NC 28270-0872

Subject: dems against Obama's budget

Comment: I have been very upset over the head-lines splashed all over the tv concerning the lack of support of many dems who are publicly criticizing Obama's budget package. I worked very hard to elect dems and voted for Obama,s vision for getting us through these difficult times. Many dems rode to victory on the president's coat-tail and this stance seems to be a slap in his face. Please support the president in any way possible and I would greatly appreciate it. I am a retired school teacher and would like to put in a plug for education also. Thank you for your time. A loyal dem who wants all senators, reps,and governors to work together. Ann B. Neal

Subject: any tax increases

Comment: I am writing to beg that any increase in taxes will be reconsidered. We are now struggling to keep our home. It's really difficult just to eat, heat and anything else needed to survive. Now I hear tolls on the roads are being considered. Where does it end for people like us. Earning 25,000.00 a year doesn't go far and increasing expenses on the people are going to destroy us. Anticipating tax increases on petrol, cap and trade will also increase utilities, again when will this end???

Subject: many questions??????????????????????????????????????????

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Why does DOC, wonder why they do not have enough money to manage there facilities? They cost us more money as tax payers every day with there BS, EXAMPLE:an inmate is in minimum custody which cost quite a bit less than medium or maximum custody, and they happen to get a right up of some sort, so they get 45 days in the hole, limited draw, no visitations, no phone for 60 days, and then they get sent back to meduim custody, do they really feel that being put in a hole like an animal is not enough to realize that they had made a big mistake, I mean, was an incident so bad as all that, especially when our enconomy is like it is. People want to talk about the prison system being broken and they do not want to discuss why it is broken, the people running the facilities are so very petty. I feel that the people that have worked so hard to get to feel like human beings, doing human things, and then they make one wrong move and the system does not consider that they have pretty much done the time for the crime that they went in for, they look at the incident and then see why they are in there and charge them for the crime they committed 13 years ago instead of the incident at hand. Govenor Perdue our system is broken, I have talked to so many people at DOC, these past two months, it is as if they have all taken the same class on how to blow smoke up people's ass, they say things like, I am sorry that I can not help you, there is nothing I can do,or you have the right to appeal, or the inmate can file a grievence, they (DOC) are thick as thieves, and have some issues of there very own. When they do not know how to talk to the public, every thing is black or white, when they are uneducated, and just common liars, we do not have the ability to right them up or put them in a hole. For me stealing money from your work place is just as bad as talking on a cell phone from work release. When people do nothing and they all play the same game and none of them can do there job because they have to go along with each other, why are they there if they can not think for themselves or make educated investigations into what the incident at hand is. Why are we paying them to sit there and go along with the each other. When they say you can appeal something, you can here the snicker in there voice, they are so very certain that it will not change anything.I have been trying to reach Alvin Keller for over one month, I truly feel that the tax payers have a right to know just what DOC is really about. I would also like to have a meeting with you on finding a solution, I have a great deal that I can bring to the table in this matter, it would cut the expenses of housing these inmates by a very large margin. I have told them that I would like to get your take on it first, before I go any further. I am at a point of no return with this current system, and I truly need your help at this time. Also I campained for Roy Carter for 1 year, He coached my chidren in football for a couple of years, I work with people who have drug and alcohol problems, I have spoken at schools, hospitals, conventions, about drugs and alcohol abuse. I do alot of community service, I feel this is worthy of my time and possibly a calling to help the people in the system that do not have a voice, it is a joke when they tell one of them to file a grievence and everyone of them know it. Some of them committed serious crimes when they were locked up, punishing them for an incident or a right up for something they did 13 years prior is unacceptable and a waste of money and resources. I keep saying this because when I proceed to ask DOC, if they really feel that the punishment for the right up given,fits the incident at hand, that is there argument, well he committed a serious crime in 1996. Well he has also served 2 complete sentences and working on his last one, that has nothing to do with what he was wriiten up for. Well then they say we have to protect the community. Well he is not a threat to the community and the real threat is our economy. Seems to me the system is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Please know that I am writing you as a last resort, I have gone through every chain of command, now I wish that I had not even folllowed protocal, because it has been a huge waste of my time and effort, other than the fact that I learned just how bad things really are when people do not do there job. It is just another form of stealing. Nor do they give a damn about someones mental state and just how much should one have to bare, even if they are just a number to the facility, one day they will be in our society, really how is our system teaching them to be productive members of society, when all they see is people making up there on rules and then telling them to file a grievence and laughing at them, because the people telling them that, already know that no one will over turn there decision, It is beyond anything that I have ever seen in my life and I have seen a lot. The system is broken, maybe one person can not make a difference but one person can exploit what is going on in the system. Media is not really the route I want to go, I feel that my hand is being forced, because no one seems to hear what I am saying. They will not be able to take my voice like they have taken the inmates voice with there methods. This is important enough to keep me up nights, that has not ever happened to me, Nor have I ever written anyone for help in any matter, I am writting you because, I feel that there are things that you need to know in order to be effective and make a difference. Also because I feel that with your guidance I may not make as many mistakes in this process, I know it will be a process and I understand that it will not change over night, and I also know that if I just do nothing, nothing will ever change, my heart is in it. So the inmates, may not have a voice but I do, I pay taxes, there must be a reason that I feel these guys and girls need a voice. Please Please Please, help me to help others and our economy. Thank You in advance for your time in this matter. You may contact me anytime, at 336-452-1038 Kimberly Y. B. Wilson

Subject: laws regarding access to calling 911 EMS

Comment: In 7-08 my husband Ralph rented for a week a motel room in Burke Co. NC. The phone in the room didn't work and the owners DENIED Ralph calling for 911 EMS assistance. We now know due to an abnormal MRI done at that time Ralph had a TIA or mini stroke. I spoke to a Burke Co. magistrate whom said NC law says we humans don't have to call 911 for each other and we don't have to let a renter use a working phone to call 911 and the phone in the room didn't have to work. I'm very unsettled with those responses and would like to know how I myself can read that law and possibly what I can do to help change such an inhumane sounding law. Thank you for any info. you have or may direct us to!!

Comment: If you really want to save lives and money in NC, Please pass a ban on driving and speaking on cell phones. These accidents cost the state more money than you can really imagin. There is not a day t6hat I don't get into a near miss situation with someone who is not paying attention on the road because they are busy talking on the phone. Help me, Save me and many others who have to share the road with these inconsiderate people. Impose a $250 fine on anyone caught speaking on their cell phones or even worse texting while driving
