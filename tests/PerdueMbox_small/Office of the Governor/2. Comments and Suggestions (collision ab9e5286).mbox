Gov. Perdue Presents Lawmakers with Pathway to Protecting Education, Core Services within a Balanced Budget

In a letter to lawmakers this week, Gov. Bev Perdue provided a pathway to a balanced budget that protects education and other core services. The pathway also calls upon budget writers to make significant cuts, to increase revenue through specific revenue increases and to take steps to modernize North Carolina‚Äôs tax code, including permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates.
Gov. Perdue outlined the four key principles she believes are vital to a balanced and responsible budget. The pathway incorporates aspects of existing proposals, including some from her own budget and from the House and Senate.†
‚ÄúWe must remember that the decisions we make today are not about our political future, they are about our children‚Äôs future,‚Äù she said.
The letter, sent to every Senate and House member, detailed these principles:
- Protection of education and core public safety and health care services
- Fairness to working families
- Modernization of the tax code with permanent rate reduction
- Targeted tax relief

Gov. Perdue Signs Executive Orders to Increase Transparency in State Government

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†signed†Executive†Orders 17 and 18 to bring greater transparency and accountability to state government.
‚ÄúThese executive orders further expand on two hallmarks of my administration ‚Äì transparency and accountability,‚Äù said Perdue. ‚ÄúOnly when the doors of government are open wide, and the sun truly shines in, can we be sure that our government by the people is working for the people.‚Äù
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemIDP9>Executive Order 18 declares that executive branch emails sent to and from state government accounts will be retained and archived as public records for 10 years. Executive branch employees must keep all emails they send for at least 24 hours so that those emails can be copied to backup tapes. Emails received must also be kept for 24 hours unless the email is clearly not related to state business. The order also directs ITS to develop a new email archiving system and make it available to all executive branch agencies for which it provides email services as soon as practicable. Until the new archiving system is developed, ITS will continue to keep backup tapes of emails sent to and from state government accounts. The Governor has invited all parts of†state government over which she does not have direct control, including the legislative and judicial branches, to participate in this program.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemIDP8>Executive Order 17 directs the Department of Commerce to obtain and report the names of consultants involved in economic development projects that seek benefits from the state‚Äôs incentive programs.† Information on consulting relationships will be provided to the Secretary of Commerce, the Economic Investment Committee, and the Governor to better assist them in making conflict of interest assessments and will be retained as part of each project‚Äôs file.

Subject: crippled

Comment: You can't have any idea how much you and the legislature have crippled State employees & teachers. I am in the poorest health I have ever been in my life thanks to the recent changes made to the SHP. I went for TWO MONTHS without a crucial medication I've taken for years because BCBS started denying coverage. Oh, they would approve half a dozen meds I've already tried and didn't work,or couldn't take, but not the only one I needed. I was left to battle the appeals process for two months, while in the mean time, I'm in unbearable pain. It was all I could do to go to work and come back home and get into bed again. NOW, with the prescription drug copay changes, I can't get some of the brand name drugs I need because I can't afford to pay $1,000 out of pocket a month, especially with you raiding my paycheck. Not all generics work for people the same (or at all) as brand name. Don't you think if I could have switched all of my meds to generic, I would have? It costs more for me, too. But, now you all have made brand name SO expensive we have to swith, or take out a loan. And shoving generics down my throat doesn't make them start working. Going without my brand name meds is ruining my life-I can't be with my family and can't work like I need to because I'm bedridden. The State made some terrible decisions concerning the SHP this year. You can't deny so much coverage that you make your employees deathly ill...they can't really be very productive like that, can they? BTW, I am only 27 and have a condition that is easily controlled if it weren't for constant denials for what most consider basic coverage and unreasonable, preventative copays. You can believe I'm telling my story to anyone and everyone who will listen. So far "appalled" sums up everyone's reaction to my treatment by the State and SHP.

Re:††† ††† Reduction in support staff school nurses

After extensive research†for criteria on the elimination of school nurses†I am at a loss as to what to expect in the event of reduction. The state requires school nurses hold a B.S. in nursing.†School nurses then†have a maximum of three years from hire date to obtain national certification. Based on my observation there are diploma and associate†RN's,† two year degrees, that have been employed more than three years in school systems, and have made no effort to obtain their B.S. and ultimately the required certification (requires a B.S.)†as a school nurse.

When a school system goes by last hired first fired on nurses it should go by the same criteria used for teachers which lists the first to be eliminated are the ones that do not hold the required degree or credentials. East Carolina†requires 4 1/2 years to obtain a B.S. in nursing.†The extra 2 1/2 years of education is the difference in critical thinking with a detailed base†of theory needed to operate independently in a school system.

Since nurses licenses are governed by the Board of Nursing and not the DPI it really leaves nurses that†are "qualified"†in limbo†when unqualified nurses are retained just because of their hire date. I feel administrators do no understand that a RN can hold an associate degree (2 years)†and†not meet the requirements set forth in the state law.

I am requesting criteria be compiled†for school nurses such as the ones for teachers when a reduction in workforce takes place and disperse it to the LEAs in North Carolina.

Thank you for†your hard work and the†tough decisions you are having to make in today's economy.

Sincerely,

Susan Hodges BSN NCSN

Subject: Proposed NC Internet Tax

Comment: Governor Perdue: I'm writing to inform you that as of June 26th, 15 online retailers have canceled the advertising accounts of thousands of website owners. Why? Because of the proposed "Nexus and Clickthrough" tax currently included in SB 202 (Section 27C.2). Yes, the companies have jumped the gun a bit but they did that in order to remove the liability of nexus. As such, they're shut down our advertising accounts and some of us, who rely on that income to survive, are now out of business. Amazon was the first company to shut down NC accounts. Unless this section of the budget bill is removed our accounts will remain closed. Sure, NC residents will continue to purchase products from Amazon and other online retailers, but, because Amazon and other companies have closed our advertising accounts, our income has come to a halt. People tend to point to New York as an example of how Amazon is "bluffing." Not so. The only reason Amazon was not able to avoid nexus in New York is because the NY Legislature passed an emergency, last minute budget bill that included the Internet tax language. The small business owners in New York have been very vocal about what happened there - it was a surprise to everyone. Once nexus was established Amazon had to charge sales tax on all purchases made by NY residents. The saying "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me" is at work here. Because Amazon did not remove their nexus liability in NY in time they were obligated to collect sales tax. Not so in North Carolina. Amazon has already removed their nexus liability. Therefore the state won't see the proposed sales tax revenue. Even worse, hundreds of families that rely on this advertising income have now been cut off. Does Governor Perdue understand the problems the Internet Tax has caused? Does she know that the governors from both California and Hawaii recently vetoed bills containing this tax because of the damage it would cause to small businesses? Does she know that hundreds of NC small business owners feel as if she doesn't care, because none of us have received responses to our inquiries? Does she know that once this bill is signed into law, NC will lose millions of taxable income? I attended a meeting the other day and between the people there we represented a little over $1M in taxable NC income. Most of those people will have to leave the state in order to continue making a living online. Governor Perdue's reputation amongst many small business website owners is at an all time low because no one seems to care about this issue. We see the governors from other states taking an interest in this issue, but have not seen Governor Perdue stand up for us. Does Governor Perdue understand that NC is now being seen as a "non-tech" state because we're proposing this tax? If the Internet Tax is included in the bill, online businesses that rely on advertising revenue will be all but dead in this state. I can't tell you how many websites I've visited where internet experts (and respected publications like the Wall Street Journal) are shocked that we're moving forward on this considering the damage it will do. If someone could respond to this message with something more than a canned "thank you" response, it would be greatly appreciated and go a long way with some of the small businesses in the state. Let's show the rest of the country that our governor makes measured and informed decisions about the livelihood of its citizens. Thank You.

I am writing in favor of saving the transferable classes in the Huskins/Dual Enrollment program.† A Bill that would eliminate these courses would have a great impact and adverse effect on our small school system in Pamlico County.† Taking college credit/honors courses while in high school puts our students at a competitive level for placement in top universities and for potential scholarship earnings.†



Please do not discontinue funding for these courses.

I am a little confused.† If I understand you correctly, the record shortfalls all have to be taken from the education budget and therefore no matter what is needed, we should agree with it.† What does this have to do with a tax that taxes one part of a particular industry and not all the industry?† PS.† Do we not have any "shovel ready" projects that the promised federal money could supplement.

> For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession.

> In March, the Governor presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaís long-term economic growth. Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion to an expected record of $4.7 billion for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaís history.

> As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

> Public education always†has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaís economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would cut short our long-term economy.

> Governor Perdue has been meeting with legislative leaders urging them to act quickly to pass a budget ñ and to pass one that protects core education, public safety, and health care services

> Governor Perdue recognizes that deep cuts need to be made as she works with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days.† The legislature has already recommended raising revenue ñ but itís imperative that they raise enough to protect services that are core to North Carolinaís values

> Please contact your North Carolina legislator and ask them to protect North Carolinaís core education, public safety, and health care services.

Dear Governor Purdue,

I write this to you with a heavy heart. I live in Massachusetts and rescued a dog from your state last year, and ever since have been a major force in trying to save the lives of these precious dogs and puppies who, each and every week are just discarded like trash, into high kill gassing facilities down there. How can you let this still happen? It is no different than Hitler and the Holocaust. These animals never asked to be where they are and deserve the chance to know what life and love are all about! This is a torturous way to euthanize an animal. Don't you think that they have suffered enough beforehand, just by being surrendered by their owners, dumped in the middle of nowhere, then put into a cage and left to die? If it wasn't for all the wonderful volunteers at the shelter, who,†by the way, work full-time jobs and work tirelessly each and every week, trying to save the lives of† these wonderful, temperament tested dogs and pups and cats in their free time, which amounts to every day after work, none of them would ever make it out of there! The people who get paid by your state do absolutely nothing!

Did you know that gassing is much more expensive than putting an animal down via injection? Not only does it take 30 to 40 minutes for the animal to die, but they suffer immensely. They†claw so desperately, trying to get out, that they bleed profusely, their throats burn so badly, they cannot breathe, and they are fed nothing the night before, just so there is less of a mess to clean up after they are executed.†It is also extremely hazardous to the individuals who do this process. Up north, we are much more humane. We have to license our dogs, pay more if they are not spayed or neutered, and if we cannot find homes for them, we put them down comfortably, via injection.

I am a major animal advocate and am very good friends with 2 investigative reporters up here, that plan on writing and broadcasting about how animals down south in shelters, especially in NC are being killed. If this is the only way to get people to smarten up about what needs to be done, then this is what is going to take place. I am pleading with you to stop this gassing from continuing, and to start making more of an effort to utilize your powers to make certain that there are more affordable spaying and neutering clinics and that these dogs, pups and other animals will not have to suffer the way that they do! I am certain a deal can be made with pharmaceutical companies who deal with veterinary products, to be able to get syrum needed for these humane injections.

We are all having difficult times right now, people are losing their jobs and their homes, but our beloved animals have no voice! So, I guess it is left up to people like myself and others to make their voices be heard. Believe me, I am not the kind of person who takes a back seat to ANYTHING! Perseverence does pay off!

Thank you for your time and I truly hope to hear from you soon. The articles and reports are†scheduled to be put into action next week, all around the country.

Sincerely,
Debi Webb

Subject: Health Care

Comment: Hello, Who is regulating the Insurance Companies? Insurance raised their rates 9.5% this last year. The Government is looking at this all wrong. I have not seen any member of the Government give up their insurance and volunteer to pay for their own insurance. Why don't you look into why Blue Cross and Blue Shield will pay a percentage of a procedure and a person who don't have insurance has to pay full price for the same procedure? Why can't the government look at how many illegal immigrants are on welfare? Why is it so hard for the government to see this. Then in return you are going to put a higher tax tag on people who you classify as wealthy. you need to read the Preamble for every state in our nation and think hard about what this government is doing to the very people who put you and everyone else in office. The government can regulate the banking and automotive industries, but no one has touched the Insurance Companies. AIG insured loans and that is different. Taxes in this country started on a voluntary basis and it has been pushed to the breaking point that the people will have to depend on the government to survive. These problems have been derived by the Government to suppress the weak and timid. This next Election will have a totally different out come. My Dad always told me be careful what you sow, because it can come back to bite you! this issue with health care and the I-485 completion has bitten you. I can say with certainty that the next election you lost my vote. Charlotte is part of this state and it has 2 pro teams and the home of NAS-CAR and as much money that is generated by the sports reams and the Banking industry why can't we get these projects in and around Charlotte done. Think about Duke Energy based here; what about Belk Stores? What about Family Dollar? Mecklenburg Counties Declaration of Independence, May 20, 1775

Subject: Public Plan

Comment: Wanda Draughn Draughn 101 Friends Lane Archdale, NC 27263-3179 July 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: I have some serious concerns about health care reform I would like to share with you which would have the effect of severely limiting access for constituents. The anesthesiology community is very concerned about a Medicare-based public plan option. This is a significant economic issue for our specialty. The "Tri-Committee" bill currently circulating around the House of Representatives assumes that all physicians are the same and treated the same under Medicare. That is not true. Anesthesiology is unique. The Medicare payment methodology for anesthesia services is very different from the methodology used to pay for other physician services. It is also deeply flawed. Medicare has long underfunded payments for anesthesia services. According to a 2007 Rep. Pete Stark requested Government Accountability Office (GAO is the accounting arm of the U.S. Congress) study, anesthesia services are paid at 33 cents on the dollar compared to commercial/private pay; a 67 percent discount on commercial/private insurance (GAO-07-463). I think we need to refocus on our current Medicaid and Medicaid system and cut out the abuse within this system. I know for a fact we can save millions there. To our knowledge, this is the lowest paid level for services compared to commercial/private pay of any physician service. For other physicians, averaged across all physician services, Medicare pays about 80 percent of commercial/private insurance (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, March 2009, pg 96). Expanding Medicare payment levels for anesthesia services to a larger beneficiary population as envisioned in the House "Tri-Committee" proposal would be unsustainable for anesthesiology private and academic settings. We urge Congress to move away from a public plan based upon Medicare rates; a payment mechanism that does not recognize the differences in physician practices or the different Medicare payment mechanisms in use and their flaws. Will you assist us in fixing the "33% problem" for anesthesia providers?" It is imperative that we start getting them to acknowledge that they will need to be part of our solution if this occurs. Thank you for listening and if you ever have any questions about the impact of health care legislation, I would be happy to discuss them.

Subject: National Children's Study Leadership

Comment: North Carolina has the distinction of having seven sites designated for the National Children's Study: Buncombe County, Burke County, Cumberland County, Durham County, Gaston County, Rockingham County, and Duplin County. Duplin County is one of the first two "Vanguard" sites to be started in the study in early 2009. I am extremely concerned about the future of the Study because of the recent ouster of the Study Director, Dr. Peter Scheidt. He was recently replaced by the Directors of NICHD and NIH supposedly for mismanagement of funds. Dr. Scheidt has been the heart and soul of the NCS. Without his leadership over the past 9 years, the Study would never have progressed to the point of being in the field today. His so-called mismanagement has been to carefully guide the organization of the Study through the quagmire of the government budgeting process and to successfully launch this multiple-agency cooperative venture that will be the most important venture for children's health in our state and our nation for the next generation and for generations to come. Please support Dr. Scheidt and the continued development of the National Children's Study by contacting Dr. Kington, Acting Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Alexander, Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Sincerely, Carole A. Kimmel, Ph.D.

Subject: House's "health care for all Americans" bill

Comment: There is a provision in the bill that has not been publicized, that the public should know about. According to the bill, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to enroll individuals. In other words, those who currently have private individual coverage won't be able to change it. Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers. The following is on page 16 of the bill: ‚ÄòExcept as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day" of the year the legislation becomes law.‚Äô http://docs.house.gov/edlabor/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf I also think it is important for the public to know that, according to the Washington Post, about half the costs of the plan to cover 37 million uninsured Americans will be born by Medicare cuts to the disabled and the elderly. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/14/AR2009071403709.html?wprss=rss_nation Lynn Lowry 919-413-4710

Subject: Health Care & more

Comment: As an American citizen, I am appalled to sit and listen to Washington even discussing much less considering spending any amount of money on wild horses, when our economy is in the state it is, with job loss, and so many having a difficult time providing the basic necessities for their families. In addition, I want to voice my opposition regarding Health Care. Let me make it clear that from my point of view based on what I see and here from the people of this Nation, Nancy Pelosi's statement that they have the support of the American People with the current legislation for "Universal Health Care", "Health Care Reform", or "Nationalization of our Health Care System" (whatever it is actually being called now), is certainly not the case. I emplore and encourage you to fight this legislation for all it's worth. I believe strongly that if this passes, it will damage our Nation far beyond our Health Care system. I am in opposition to requiring small businesses to provide health care for their employees. As in our area the possibility of this has already resulted in businesses closing. If this requirment leads to job loss, then we have Americans that not only are without health care, but are also without an income to support their families, which makes no sense in this unstable economy. I am also in opposition to adopting California Building Codes for the entire nation, as I believe it will only harm the financial situation of our American families further. Our home was built to code, new in 2001 and even we would not meet the minimum requirements in that case. It is a well built, energy efficient home. Adopting these codes would make it impossible for us to afford to sell our home in order to purchase a home that better suits our family. The next few years have the potential to change America forever and I believe quite probably for the worst. I will determine who I support politically in the future, based upon the positions taken on these and many other issues. Again, I emplore you to fight for the people of this country rather than big government.

Subject: Thank you for supporting HB 2

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Thank you for showing a commitment to protecting the health and well-being of the citizens of North Carolina through your support of House Bill 2, Prohibit Smoking in Certain Public Places. I am looking forward to January 2, 2010 when all restaurants and bars in North Carolina become smoke-free. This is a great step in the right direction toward protecting North Carolina's workers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Once HB 2 becomes law, 69% of the workforce, or nearly 2.8 million North Carolina workers, will be protected by smoke-free policies. In addition, millions more North Carolinians will be protected from short-term exposure when spending time in our restaurants and bars. Studies have shown that smoke-free laws can reduce deaths and hospital admissions due to heart attack by 20%; in North Carolina, this would translate to more than 4,000 admissions and 800 deaths due to heart attacks. This will save us more than $15 million in health care costs. More than 395,000 North Carolina bar and restaurant workers will be able to go to work knowing that their hearts and lungs are protected by smoke-free policies. Your support of HB 2 shows commitment to improving health and saving lives. Thank you for standing up for the right to breathe smoke-free air.

Subject: A Desperate Urging to the Governor

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Over the last few days and weeks, I have followed the health care bill and its possible presence in America for the near future. I urge you today to please take a stand against universal health care. I am nineteen years of age and realize the ramifications of such healthcare plans being implemented into America, not only for my generation and future generations, but for every generation. It is competition that drives business owners to provide better service for their customers- this is surely no exception within the health care system. Times are difficult, but a universal health care system is absolutely not ‚Äúreform.‚Äù Caution is needed with this expeditiously moving work led by Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues, and as a resident of North Carolina, I urge you to exercise this caution. Universal health care, although seemingly the answer to all health care problems in America, is not the answer. Much like the Division of Motor Vehicles or the United States Postal Service, government seems to handle entities in an inefficient manner as opposed to that of the private sector. Universal health care seems to be much like a free giveaway of ice cream when a new store opens- long lines form and people wait for their ice cream. The same situation arises with universal health care where medical procedures and services are performed for the price of nothing, but good people wait for care that they need. So again, I urge you, Governor Perdue, to consider the universal health care system and to see if it really has a place in the America that we know, love, and appreciate. I have two other family members in my household that I will make sure show their support for you when elections come around if you do indeed support the well-being of the state rather than the ideology of your party. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration in this matter and I will continue to follow you in your decisions for the well-being of North Carolina. Sincerely, Michael G. Mazzotta

Subject: reinstatement of drivers license for repeat dwi offenders

Comment: Thank God for bill H1185.The sooner you sign this bill the better.For to long the citizens of NC have had to suffer shame and humiliation for actions committed in youth.DWI is a serious lapse in judgement and as a person grows and matures it really hits home just how serious it is,but,as in all things there is a time to put the past behind and go about living life.Every one deserves a chance to live an honest and productive life after they have shown themselves capable of that.Lack of a drivers license is a hindrence that should not last forever.Thank You

Comment: I've graduated from college 12 years ago and still have not landed a job using my education. I graduated with a BS degree in Business Administration with tracks in Management. Why are my skills not in demand? What started this? Teachers and everyone. When your a child in the united states people tell you to go to school and be someone. I did and now unemployment. I am so hurt that I could not land a job. What really hurts the most is I can not get my money back and I never want to read a book again.

Comment: Please take note of CA...we will end up in the same situation if we do not enforce our laws and get them out of our state. We need to be harder on businesses that hire them. If there are no jobs - they will leave (at least our state) Those jobs could go to our many unemployed legal citizens with "supplimental" unemployment benefits. We NEED to use COMMON SENSE on these issues. The stimulus monies should be used to help new businesses start and flourish. That would create jobs more than anything else.

Is there any warranty on work done for the "DOT" I saw the road after it was opened, it needed repair with in months, this should be fixed at the contractors cost! Or they will never work in this state again!

Subject: racism in NC

Comment: FOURTEEN YEARS OF RACISM BY PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL IN CHARLOTTE Ron A. Virmani, M.D. On September 1, 1995, Presbyterian hospital called me to their imposing corporate Board Room in Charlotte, NC and dropped a bomb on me. They said they were summarily suspending my hospital privileges at 4 PM that day! Suspension from a hospital is a kiss of death for any physician! Without hospital privileges, I could never deliver another baby nor help women in need of gynecologic surgery. My future went bleak in front of my eyes! I knew that they had been reviewing my charts for several months now. But they never gave me a chance to explain my actions and defend my charts as required by hospital‚Äôs own by-laws. This was truly a stab in the back. ‚ÄúWe do not have to tell you what the charts are.‚Äù Said then CEO of Presbyterian hospital Mr. Paul Betzold and chief of ob-gyn Dr. Ronald Brown. They simply stated that I had 24 ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù charts, as determined by the peer review committee. Having migrated from India, I had received my M.D. from New Jersey Medical School in 1985 and finished my ob-gyn residency from Temple University hospital in 1989. I had come to Charlotte in 1990 and become a member of Presbyterian hospital medical staff as an ob-gyn physician. On December 1994, I had a surgical mishap. Inadvertently, I punctured the external iliac artery in a patient during laparoscopy. This was unfortunate but a known complication of such a procedure. I immediately proceeded to laparotomy and summoned Dr. John Hollenbeck (general surgeon) and Dr. Scott Andrews (cardiovascular surgeon) to assist me. We repaired the injury and the patient went home after a few days stay in the hospital. My malpractice insurance company as well as several independent reviewers determined that I met the standard of care in this case. However, citing business reasons, the insurance company later decided to settle the lawsuit for 300K. Following the incident, Presbyterian hospital went on a fishing expedition of my charts from over a two year period. Most of these charts had been filed in the hospital archives as having no quality of care issues. Anyway, a departmental ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù committee headed by Dr. James Hardy nitpicked and labeled 24 of them ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù out of my 102 charts reviewed. The Medical Board of North Carolina asked an experienced ob-gyn physician from Charlotte, Dr. Kenneth Chambers to review my cases. He as well as several other reviewers found my charts to be within the standard of care. According to a letter circulated by Dr. Jared Schwartz in October 1998 among the hospital‚Äôs medical staff, I was the first physician to be suspended in 20 years at Presbyterian hospital! Was it just a coincidence that I was the first ob-gyn physician of Indian origin at Presbyterian hospital? I went to the local courts and dug up medical malpractice cases. I found out the following facts, which are true to the best of my knowledge. Dr. W. Wortman injured a patient‚Äôs bladder at a laparoscopy. The jury found him negligent and awarded the Plaintiff $100,000. (92-CVS-16674) Dr. Kenneth Baker performed a laparscopic surgery in October 1993 at Union Memorial Hospital. An injury to the intestine was not recognized at this time. Patient presented later with abdominal abscess and died. (Union County 95 CVS 01325) Dr. Baker performed another laparoscopy in November 1994 at which time a bowel perforation was not recognized. She died of sepsis. (Union County, 96 CVS 00992) Presbyterian hospital had no problem subsequently giving Dr. Baker privileges in ob-gyn department. Dr. Whitesides performed a laser laparoscopy on a patient in 1995 (99- CVS-5141). The patient complained of abdominal pain on December 2 and 3, the physician prescribed stool softener. On December 4, she passed out and the husband had to carry her. An exploratory laparotomy and hemicolectomy was done. Suit also named Nalle clinic. Dr. C. Ellington performed a laser laparoscopy in September 1991 on a patient and perforated her small bowel. She underwent multiple subsequent surgeries and became unable to eat and drink. She was placed on TPN (intravenous nutrition). The suit also named Bradford Clinic and PHAC. (94-CVS-11679) Dr. John Tidwell performed a laparoscopy on a patient who died from overwhelming sepsis six days later. (97-CVS-1707) Dr. Tidwell also failed to respond to nurse‚Äôs pages for another patient in labor in August 1989. The infant suffered severe physical and neurological injuries. (92-CVS-11209) Dr. A J Lewis failed to manage fetal distress during labor in 1992, the parties named (Dr. Lewis and Mintview ob-gyn) settled for $5M in May 1995. Drs. M. Torres and K Stephens were performing a hysterectomy at Presbyterian hospital, while managing a labor patient at Carolinas Medical Center in September 1995. They failed to respond to fetal distress in time. The baby was born with zero apgars and died 16 hours after birth.(96-CVS-9576) Dr. W. McDonald failed to assess fetal distress in February 1987. The result was severe physical and neurological injuries. (96-CVS-7927). Dr. Alice Teague delayed performing a c/section after unsuccessful vacuum extraction of a baby with much fundal pressure. The baby was born with birth asphyxia and skull fracture. The jury awarded Plaintiff 23.2 million. The hospital settled separately for $6M. (95-CVS-13212) These cases are only the tip of the iceberg of adverse events involving Presbyterian physicians. I know of no disciplinary action against these physicians by the hospital. They kept on practicing at Presbyterian hospital. Some are still there. In fact, some of them sat in my judgment. In 1996, I filed a state court case for breach of the by-laws. The hospital started a new review, ordered by the court, using outside reviewers, but then suppressed their findings! They started yet another internal review, which found 25 of my charts to be problematic. However, 10 of these charts were different from the original 24 charts! In 1998, after the letter from Dr. Schwartz circulated, I realized that I was targeted because of ethnic prejudice. In January 1999, I filed a discrimination case in the federal court. The hospital attorneys dragged the case for so long that the original judge died. A new judge was assigned. However, out of nowhere, Judge Mullen, apparently sympathetic to the hospital, appeared and grabbed the case from the new judge. He kicked out my federal lawsuit stating that I should have pleaded discrimination in the original state court case in 1996! At that time, I had no evidence of discrimination! So much for spending eleven long years in the courts and a million dollars in legal fees! My career has been destroyed for ever! Even though North Carolina Medical Board found my cases meeting the standard of care and said they would help me, they never did. All national, state, local medical organizations and leaders in the community have stood on the sidelines watching the travesty of justice. The peer review was a complete sham! After I filed a suit alleging discrimination, Presbyterian hospital became sensitized to the issue of diversity. They made alliance with Charlotte Medical Society, made up of African-American and minority doctors. They started sending their employees to diversity workshops. But they do not even think about rehabilitating my destroyed career and life! Damn the Indian! I have struggled with my sweat and blood for 14 years and become a martyr just like Dr. M.L.K. Jr. I am left in the dust, over which the hospital is proclaiming its newfound love for diversity, rewarding many other minority physicians but continuing to completely ignore me. In this state and the country, a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the medical field. Bad physicians of the politically correct persuasions are allowed to practice based on their clout. Good physicians, who are not part of the ‚Äúgood old boys club‚Äù and not approved by the powers that be, are disciplined and thrown to dogs. The ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù system is used by the physicians to protect their own and destroy the disenfranchised. This does not bode well for the health care of the citizens of this country. RON A.

Subject: The need for new highway signs

Comment: Hello, my name is Roger Lafferty and I would like to share an issue that I find very important. I have only been living down in North Carolina for about a year. I have noticed a driving pattern I find very rude, ignorant, and most importantly very dangerous. I see a lot of people who drive slow in the left lane causing other traffic to pass on the right. On city streets and on highways. I know that from the beginning, I was taught the left lane is for passing and for emergency vehicles. I also drive an emergency vehicle at work and it seems that drivers have no idea where to go when approached by an emergency vehicle. They come to a dead stop in traffic, they drive to the middle turn lane, they proceed through red lights,they stop in the middle of intersections, up onto curbs, etc. All of these driving habits are very dangerous and I see them over and over every day on duty and off duty. I would like to know who I can write a letter to voicing my complaint to in North Carolina. I have seen road signs in other states that read "Slow traffic keep right - It's the law." I would like to see those signs implemented here in North Carolina. Please tell me what I have to do to get this started. Thank you very much for your time and consideration to this matter. Roger J. Lafferty

Comment: Paul LaGrange 5805 Horse Pasture Lane #132 charlotte, NC 28269-3347 July 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects over 600,000 Americans. It has no known cure and can inflict pain & discomfort on sufferers at any time or place. When a person suffers a Crohn's episode, often only the use of a restroom can alleviate their discomfort. And what could be worse than suffering a CD episode in public? Having it happen at a business with no public restroom and being denied access to the employee-only facilities - causing a subsequent humiliating incident. The state of Illinois did something about this problem. It started when a teenaged CD patient named Ally Bain got in contact with her state representative detailing her own public incident. Ally wanted change. She wanted to make sure what happened to her would never happen again to her or anyone else. So she asked that Illinois pass a new law granting Crohn's sufferers access to employee-only restrooms if they were to ever have an episode. In May of 2005, Illinois House Bill 834 was introduced, passed unanimously, and officially called the Restroom Access Act. It addressed all of Ally's concerns and will forever be known as Ally's Law. I ask you today to vote for bill this bill in our state. With your help, we can eliminate these avoidable, embarrassing and potentially harmful situations. Thank you for your time. I hope you find this bill as important as I do. ÔøΩAs a sufferer of Ulcerative Colitis and recent recipient of j-pouch surgery and a temporary ileostomy I can tell you that I'm often afraid to go anywhere for fear of a lack of access to a restroom. To my dismay at this time no law has been introduced in NC providing rights to access restrooms in times of emergency for those of us who suffer from diseases such as crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Just as others with disabilities have protections under the law please provide us with this. Sincerely, Paul LaGrange 704-668-1198

Subject: Governor's School Funding

Comment: I am shockingly disappointed in the current plan to fund Governor's School on the state budget. Charging students $500 for tuition is simply unacceptable. There are many capable students who simply can not afford this. I am a Governor School alumni and if I had been charged $500, I probably would not have attended. I have a sister, Sarah, attending Governor's School East right now and my youngest sister, Anna, has heard so much of it, she can't wait to attend. Do you and the rest of Raleigh really want me to have to someday sit my sister down and tell her "Anna, I'm sorry, but you can't attend Governor's School, even though I did. We just don't have the money for it." Why in America, is education a premium only the privileged can manage? If I have to, I'll take up a job, while in college, to pay for my sister to learn. Whatever happened to that Education Lottery? Why doesn't Raleigh cut the commercials I see late at night for the lottery and allot that money to fund actual education? Cutting Governor's School is cutting North Carolina's future. So much for it being "Governor's" School.

Thanks for keeping me on your list of recipients of the Governor's
regular notifications... it's nice to be informed.

Regarding the safety of Coal Ash ponds, because coal burning generators
will be among us for a long while to come, I recommend the state of North
Carolina participate in the research and development of more ways to use
this ash in a manner that benefits society.

The same rail cars that bring the coal to our generators could easily
carry it away to various manufacturers of building blocks, saving the
cost of mining the aggregate from the ground for cement blocks.  I've
always heard cinder blocks were better insulators... is that true?

There must be other areas where the material in these ponds can be used
to our collective benefit instead of posing a hazard to our cities, homes
and waterways.

Most sincerely,

Sam Stone
Hendersonville

Subject: House Bill 1185 Habitual DWI-Reinstatement Petition/10 Yrs.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Please DO NOT sign House Bill 1185. I believe that drunk driving is a major problem in our state. We cannot stop it from happening and many innocent people continue to die as a result of people with a substance abuse problem not being able to make the choice not to drive while impaired. Habitual indicates that the individual has a serious substance problem. A person convicted four times in 10 years has a serious enough problem that they are willing to risk their driving privilege for life. If the threat of a lifetime loss of their driving privileges was not enough to discourage them what will stop them now? I am not saying that these are bad people but they are people with a serious problem that they cannot control. I am sure that there are some folks that have received help and are deserving of a second chance but I fear that many who have not will fall through the cracks of the bureaucracy and will cause more innocent death and injury. Our state has serious problems with many recent failures in our parole system. If we cannot manage the parole of violent criminals I cannot see how this program will provide the assurance necessary to keep people with a serious problem from doing further harm to themselves and other innocent people. Governor Perdue, I ask you not to sign or support this bill. Thank you for your consideration. Steve Plante

Subject: Vote No on Senate Bill 20

Comment: Beth Kane 104 Barnacle Circle Surf City, NC 28445-6578 July 18, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I am opposed to forced funding of Political campaigns. Dear Representative and Senator, Senate Bill 20 would expand forced taxpayer financing of political campaigns to the office of the state treasurer. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. Taxpayers in North Carolina can not take another burden during this economic crisis. Please vote against Senate Bill 20 and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns. Sincerely, Beth Kane 910-338-0871

Subject: Cap And Trade Bill

Comment: I am against the Cap and Trade Bill this will put a great burden on the public more taxes on electric bills on heating and gasoline and we will lose more jobs. My son has been out of work since Jan. and no hope of getting a job how can the government justified raising taxes on people that do not even have jobs and how come the Senate and Congress never read what they are voting on no one will ever take the time to read this cap and trade bill when we were promise by President Obama that the senate and congress would read the bills and also post them on the internet. How do our Congress or the Senate will know if these bills will help or harm the American people. I was against the bails outs and stimulus plan and it has done nothing but put our country in debt. I write Congressman Coble and also email him and he always respond to my concern I write and email Senator Burr and he always respond to my concerns I write and email Senator Kay Hagan and she never responds to concerns I have also call and ask why she has not respond to my concerns and I would like to know how she stands on these bills but either she no opinion or she can not defend the bills or she does not care. I hope that this Cap and Trade Bill will not pass so many people in my neighborhood could not afford propane to heat their homes the only way they had was eletric heaters and kerosene heaters because to fill up one propane tank is 700.00 last year and one tank will not last the winter. More taxes on gasoline will put more burden people that have lost jobs have also lost their only car in North Carolina we do not have public transportion so how do these people find jobs and get to jobs we can not do like the government does print money and go in debt. These people want to work but they can not get out of the hole. I am 57 years old and I have never seen the country in such bad shape and I am not writing this for myself I am so concern for younger couples and my children and my grandchildren. What else can I do? I must voice my concerns this is all I can do so many people that I talk to are so concern and fears that we are taking our country in the wrong direction and can not believe that our Congressman and Senators will not even take the time to read these bills. Thank You! Bonnie Thompson

To madam Perdue

Where are the jobs.

In your emails you never talk about jobs or the people who have
exhausted there unemployment.

Only about the democrats raising taxes.† The last democratic Gov. is under investigation for fraud.

I am thinking of leaving North Carolina for a state that has no state taxes.

Subject: Appointment to talk to you!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I don‚Äôt have to tell you how bad the economy is. Not just here in North Carolina, but across the whole nation. Governors across the country are scrambling to pass budgets their constituents can live with. Unfortunately, in most cases this will mean imposing higher taxes and providing fewer services. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way; I have been working on a plan for the last year and I would really appreciate the opportunity to share it with you. That is of course if we choose to think outside of the box. The same old thinking/mindsets aren‚Äôt working it seems. We not only have to be smarter about our decisions but more open to new ingenuities. I will only need a few minutes of your time in order to give you a brief overview of my plan. I am looking forward to hearing back from you and possibly setting up a meeting with you! Sincerely, Tommy Lee Broughton
