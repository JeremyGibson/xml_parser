Subject: Stiffer Cild Abuse Laws

Comment: I wanted to know why my daughter: Karin Thomas-Dozier and her husband Demetrius Dozier only received a slap on the hand, after, almost every limb in my grandsons body was broken, when he was between 1week and 6 weeks old. I thought you stated when you were running for govern, that the child abuse laws were going to get stiffer, well now is the time. Guilford County Social Services is planning on putting my grandson back with his mother just because, she is following her case plan even though when she meet Mr. Dozier, he was in the process of being convicted of felony child abuse for his first son and received 14 months and only received 24 months for doing this to my grandson. Please do not let my grandson be a victim of placing him back with his mother and he ends up dead. PLEASE DO NOT LET MY GRANDSON GO BACK TO DIE

Sean please use the following reply for all longevity items:


Thank you for your e-mail regarding longevity pay for state employees. I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



On March 17, 2008, the Governor presented her 2009-2011 proposed budget to the North Carolina General Assembly. For a detailed view of the spending plan, you may wish to visit: http://www.governor.state.nc.us/budget.aspx . While the Governorâ€™s budget includes a proposal to temporarily suspend longevity payments to eligible state employees, it is important to note that this proposal will not adversely impact retirement pay. Also, by temporarily suspending longevity payments, Governor Perdue is able to keep class size low and protect classroom teachers from potential lay offs. Additionally, Governor Perdueâ€™s budget proposal includes a step increase for teachers.



The final decision for the balanced budget will be in the hands of the legislators as they work through all of this in the next few months. I encourage you to speak with your local members of the NC General Assembly and follow the budget process as it develops by visiting www.ncleg.net <http://www.ncleg.net/> .



Thank you for all you do for the children of North Carolina.

All we have heard about class size is that class numbers will have to be higher....

We are still the ones being 'temporarily' docked $ that due to us....while we are the ones doing all the work. Dock the pay of those in central office that can more readily afford to do so. Plus getting rid of teachers will also point to larger class sizes. I will save this email for when I get my class list.

Please accept my application as a ‘public member’ of the North Carolina Banking Commission. Having acted in the role of consultant, builder and developer to some of the nation’s largest real estate entities in addition to years of experience in financial marketing and advertising, I hopefully will be able to contribute meaningfully to the dialogue of the North Carolina Banking Commission. At a moment in our State’s history in which the both banker and consumer alike may feel at cross purposes, the truth remains their futures are inextricably linked. As a non-partisan elected official, the

mutual benefit of all parties concerned is always of paramount importance to me.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I would like to weigh in on your appointment for the District Attorney for the 7th district.  I support the best candidate for the job regardless of race.  I personally feel that Keith Werner is that candidate based on his record and experience but I hope you are looking for the best candiate as well.  I am a minority and I do not support the best white, black, hispanic or asian candidate for the job.  I support the best candidate period.  Although this is the appropriate thing to do, our system has been so hijacked by special interests (including those who only support certain races for an appointment like this), it now requires political courage to do the right thing.  I hope you have that courage.

Most Sincerely,

Subject: Congress to fast-track socialized healthcare this week!

from the Desk of:
Steve Elliott, President
Grassfire.org Alliance

          Back-room deal this week will put socialized healthcare on
          the fast-track. Please see below and alert your friends.
                            --Steve

Ashe,

We have just been alerted that House and Senate leaders are moving
very quickly to put socialized healthcare on a fast-track THIS WEEK
as part of the revised Obama budget.

Members of the House-Senate conference have struck a deal with
Harry Reid and the Obama team to require just a simple majority
vote in the Senate to pass Obama's massive socialized healthcare
plan.

Our contacts are also warning us that Obama's oppressive $2 trillion
global warming Carbon Tax also may be fast-tracked!

Ashe, your grassroots pressure forced the Senate to remove
this procedural trickery from the Obama budget just a few weeks ago.
But now a handful of Congressmen and the Obama team are sneaking the
fast-track language back in the budget!

+ + We have just a few hours to stop socialized healthcare
       and the oppressive Carbon Tax!

The House-Senate conference is meeting NOW and Obama's supporters
want to pass the revised budget this week in time for the conclusion
of Obama's first 100 days in office.

THIS IS A TOTAL OUTRAGE!

Democrats know they cannot get 60 votes in the Senate to pass
socialized healthcare or the Carbon Tax, so they are manipulating
the process to require only 50 votes later this year.

+ + Fax Congress Now And Say "No" To Fast-Tracking
       Socialized Healthcare and the Carbon Tax

We have set up our FaxFire to target the eight members of the
House-Senate conference along with your two Senators and your
Representative.

          We must flood these offices with faxes TODAY and
          tomorrow. Go here to schedule your faxes for
          immediate delivery:

http://www.grassfire.net/r.asp?U=18579&CID=112&RID=12844762

As always, if you would prefer to send your own faxes, please do so!
We provide all the contact information and sample letters for your
convenience at the above link.

+ + Classic Political Misdirection

Here's how this all happened...

A few weeks ago you helped Grassfire expose the Obama budgets
$2 trillion in new taxes and the plan by Democrats to fast-track
pet socialistic programs. The Senate removed the fast-track
language and it seemed to many that we had won this part of
the debate.

As a result, the liberal media -- and even the conservative media --
dropped the issue.

Then, after the Spring recess, Rahm Emanuel went to Harry Reid's
office and struck a deal to put the fast-track provisions back in.

Now, we have just hours to stop this. So...

After you send your faxes...

Please call these key members of Congress:

Call your two Senators:

Sen. Burr  202-224-3154
Sen. Hagan  202-224-6342

Call your Congressman:

Rep. Butterfield 202-225-3101

Again, this is classic D.C. back-room politics. We must take a
stand. Please schedule your faxes and make your phone calls.
Then, alert your friends.

Thanks for taking a stand at this crucial time.


Steve Elliott, President
Grassfire.org

P.S. If we lose the battle over socialized healthcare, more than
half of all Americans will earn their living off the government!
This is the tipping point -- the point of no return -- when our
country will become a socialist state like much of Europe.

Governor Purdue

I am very disappointed that you did not attend the 75th Anniversary Celebration of the GSNP. 

The far western counties have always felt a disconnect to our government in Raleigh.  Maybe we need to secede and become part of Tennessee.

The influx of tourists that we experience in Graham County and WNC in general from park visitation would be worth your acknowledgement of the contribution of this economic driver in our region of the state.

Time for Action on Smokefree Workplace Legislation

Every Worker Deserves a Safe Workplace; No one should have to Needlessly Sacrifice their Health for a Pay Check

The smokefree workplace bill (SB205) will come up in the Senate Health Committee tomorrow (Wed, Apr. 29) and then go up for a vote in the full Senate on Thursday (Thu, Apr. 30). Now is the time to strongly urge Senators to pass a clean version of the bill without the House amendment that exempts establishments with workers and patrons that are 18 and up.

Please call Senators’ offices and send in emails urging them to pass a clean version of SB205 that protects all NC workers and patrons, not just those in 18 and under establishment. Find talking points here (<http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg78cczz_5fsgbczfv>http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg78cczz_5fsgbczfv) on why the exemption is so detrimental and why the Senate should not pass a similar amendment.

Full Senate: Here is a link (<http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw>http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw) to info on our Democratic Senators, there are 29 listed. The main floor vote will be Thursday. Please call as many as you can, especially your Senator and those from your hometown (the one's with "Y" in the Sponsor column are sponsors of the bill; we just need to thank them for their support and remind them to show up and vote for a clean bill.)

Health Committee: We need to urge the supporters on the committee to attend the 11:00a.m. Senate Health Committee meeting tomorrow, Wednesday, and vote for a clean version of SB205: (<http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw>http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw) (Committee members highlighted in green)


If you’re contacting a member that represents you, or who represents your home town, let them know that you have that connection to them. You can look up who represents you here (<http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/) on the right side column under “Who Represents Me?”

Call Dan at (910) 616-0713 for more info about the smokefree workplace bill.

Many thanks,

Dan Wilkes

Over the past 20 years Scott has been a leader in many successful efforts to change public policy. During the 1990s, he led the campaign to include the $500 per-child credit and capital gains tax cuts in the Contract with America. These tax cuts were the eventual centerpieces of the 1997 tax bill and the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.

He has been the creative force behind the Tax Foundations Putting a Face on AmericaÒ’s Tax Returns project and the State Business Tax Climate Index, two programs that are changing the terms of the tax debate at the federal and state level.

Scott has written and edited three books on the federal budget and streamlining the government and has authored over 100 studies on tax policy and government spending.

He has also authored dozens of editorials and opinion pieces for publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, The New York Post and The Washington Times. Hodge has conducted over 600 radio and television interviewsincluding NBC Nightly News, CBS Nightly News, CNN, Fox Network, Hardball with Chris Mathews, and C-SPAN. In addition, he has contributed to stories on wasteful spending aired by ABC's "Prime-Time Live" and "20/20," and NBC's "Fleecing of America."

Before joining the Tax Foundation, Scott was Director of Tax and Budget Policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy. He also spent ten years at The Heritage Foundation, including eight years as Heritage×’'s Grover Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs.

Scott began his career in Chicago where he helped found the Heartland Institute in 1984. He holds a degree in political economy from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Comment: SEANC District 5 will be conducting our annual meeting on Thursday, May 21, 2009, at Western Piedmont Community College in Morganton, North Carolina. District's 5, 6, and 7 are all located in Burke, Caldwell, and McDowell Counties and are very proud to have over 5,000 state employees as members of SEANC. The District 5 meeting will start at 6:00 PM with a catered meal and our Business Session will start at 7:00 PM. We are requesting that Bev honor us with her presence as our 'Guest Speaker'.

Governor Perdue,

I would like to submit my application and resume for consideration in being appointed to a seat on the North Carolina Financial Literacy Council proposed in Senate Bill 1019.  I am very interested in this bill and have recent experience in financial literacy presentations as well as a collaboration with North Carolina State University's Master's of Accounting Program, which resulted in the first ever graduate class of its kind in the State.  It has garnered interest by the AICPA as well as other state CPA societies to help bring similar programs into the curriculum in their respective colleges and universities.  Please feel free to contact me via email at this address or by phone at 919.559.8550.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to talking to you soon.

Governor,

I am writing in support of extending commissioner Sellers’ appointment.  She has been a strong and fair advocate for injured employees and at the same time recognizes challenges employers and insurers face in complying with workers compensation laws and statutes.  Her experience is important to her operation.
