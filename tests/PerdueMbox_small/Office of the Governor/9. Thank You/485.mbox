Gov. Perdue Announces Plan to Finish I-485 Years Ahead of Schedule

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced a plan to speed completion of the I-485 Outer Loop around Charlotte by five years, saving taxpayers $50 million to $100 million.

The plan utilizes a unique construction and financing model that has never before been used in North Carolina. Under the plan, construction of the $340 million loop project would begin in 2010 and be completed by 2015. The purchase of right of way land has already begun and requests for qualifications will be posted by mid-November.

“This innovative solution saves time, saves money for NC’s taxpayers, creates jobs and proves that North Carolina will develop new solutions to our 21st century transportation challenges,” said Gov. Perdue.

The plan involves three Charlotte-area projects, placed on a fast track together, with contracts to be awarded in 2010:

1. the last five miles of the I-485 loop;
2. the interchange that connects the loop to I-85 north of Charlotte; and
3. the widening of I-85 into Cabarrus County from four lanes to eight lanes.

Known as “Design/Build/Finance,” the new plan allows one contractor to both design and build each project, and to go a step further — the winning bidders will put up part of the financing.

The key advantage of the fast-track approach is that it puts all three projects to bid in the current competitive construction environment, in which the N.C. Department of Transportation has been seeing 20 percent savings on highway projects.

Other benefits of the plan: the widening of I-85 is accelerated by 18 months, and no other Charlotte-area projects, such as Independence Boulevard, will be delayed. No other loop projects in the state will be affected either.

NCDOT sees the design/build/finance approach, which has been used successfully in other states, as a model for future transportation initiatives in the state.

Gov. Perdue Honors Veterans, Announces "I Hire Military" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue thanked North Carolina veterans at a Veterans Day Remembrance Ceremony in Jacksonville on Wednesday and issued a proclamation honoring the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country.  During the ceremony, Gov. Perdue announced the creation of the “I Hire Military” campaign to encourage businesses to hire veterans and military spouses.

“The close relationship between the civilians and the military is one of the biggest reasons I’m proud to call North Carolina home,” said Gov. Perdue.  “The ‘I Hire Military’ campaign is one more example of how North Carolina is the most military-friendly state in the nation.”

To join the “I Hire Military” campaign, businesses must visit IHireMilitary.org, sign a pledge to hire veterans and military spouses whenever practical, display the “I Hire Military” decal in their establishments, and register as part of the “I Hire Military” database.

North Carolina’s military spouses and veterans – including disabled veterans – are highly trained, dedicated workers.  Their contributions can be a bonus for any North Carolina company.  Veterans and spouses looking for work can go online to IHireMilitary.org to find a list of businesses that have signed up for the “I Hire Military” pledge.

The campaign began as a partnership between the N.C. Military Business Center and the Eastern Carolina Workforce Development Board.  At present the campaign is running in four counties – Onslow, Carteret, Craven, and Wayne– and will soon expand statewide.

Gov. Perdue Signs Executive Order Reestablishing the N.C. Film Council

Gov. Perdue on Thursday signed Executive Order #28, reestablishing the North Carolina Film Council, at a ceremony at EUE Screen Gems studios in Wilmington, home to the largest studio lot east of California.  The North Carolina Film Council advises the Governor on film industry matters and serves as a forum for film-making concerns and recommendations.

“As I continue working to create jobs and build for North Carolina’s economic future – I believe it’s critically important to maintain and improve North Carolina’s competitive edge in the global film industry,” said Perdue.

In addition to reestablishing the council, the new executive order will add duties related to the following:

• assisting in ongoing development and growth of the N.C. film industry;
• supporting fiscal incentives that help North Carolina remain competitive in recruiting films;
• assisting in developing a marketing strategy for the N.C. Film Office; and
• monitoring the North Carolina film industry and assist in developing protocol to measure filmmaking activities in North Carolina.

Earlier this summer, Gov. Perdue signed a film tax credit bill (SB 943) allowing production companies a 25 percent tax credit for film projects in North Carolina, up from the previous credit of 15 percent.

More than 2,500 North Carolinians are employed in the film industry.  In 2008 it contributed $92 million in direct spending to our economy, and $160 million in 2007.  Recent major motion pictures filmed in the state include “Nights in Rodanthe,” “Leatherheads” and “The Secret Life of Bees.”  The N.C. film industry is also home to the CW Network’s “One Tree Hill” TV series as well as hundreds of commercial and industrial productions each year throughout the state.

More than 800 movies have been filmed in North Carolina.  The state is well known for supporting its motion picture industry with a strong infrastructure and a bevy of locations that can stand in for sites throughout the world.  North Carolina boasts an exceptional variety of filming locations from the mountains to the coast, and a world-class film industry infrastructure. Wilmington’s EUE Screen Gems recently opened the largest film and television production soundstage on the East Coast.

International biopharmaceutical company Talecris Biotherapeutics is expanding its manufacturing facilities near Clayton, creating 259 new jobs over the next seven years and investing $268.7 million. The announcement was made possible in part by state Job Development Investment Grant and One North Carolina Fund awards and is contingent upon approval of local incentives.

“The competition for these types of jobs is fierce,” Perdue said.  “The fact that Talecris has found the tools it needs to succeed in North Carolina shows why this state’s business climate is consistently named as the best in the nation.”

Textile Company Adds 135 Jobs In Richmond County

Subject: I-485 Completion

Comment: Dear Ms. Purdue, As you know for several years now, there has been a delay in the finishing of Interstate 485 in Mecklenburg county. As a lifetime resident of the area, I just want to implore of you to do whatever it takes to start construction of the last leg NOW!!! Certain people or elements may pose a delay or problem in the financing or construction of the last leg but I wish for you to be resolute and keep your promise you made to us in February 2009. I know that this state still has "old boy" politics that heavily influences decisions and policies. However, Charlotte is the largest metropolitan area in North Carolina. After 20 years, the fact the the beltway isn't complete is pathetic to say the least. In summation, keep your promise and don't let anything or anybody dissuade you into shafting us of any financial or legal help in getting the project done. Remember, you are up for reelection in three more years. Respectfully, Jeff Goodman
