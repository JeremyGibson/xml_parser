Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, John Jeffrey Carr 2000 West First Street Two Piedmont Plaza, Suite 618 Winston Salem, NC 27104

Subject: Thank you for supporting HB 2

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Thank you for showing a commitment to protecting the health and well-being of the citizens of North Carolina through your support of House Bill 2, Prohibit Smoking in Certain Public Places. I am looking forward to January 2, 2010 when all restaurants and bars in North Carolina become smoke-free. This is a great step in the right direction toward protecting North Carolina's workers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Once HB 2 becomes law, 69% of the workforce, or nearly 2.8 million North Carolina workers, will be protected by smoke-free policies. In addition, millions more North Carolinians will be protected from short-term exposure when spending time in our restaurants and bars. Studies have shown that smoke-free laws can reduce deaths and hospital admissions due to heart attack by 20%; in North Carolina, this would translate to more than 4,000 admissions and 800 deaths due to heart attacks. This will save us more than $15 million in health care costs. More than 395,000 North Carolina bar and restaurant workers will be able to go to work knowing that their hearts and lungs are protected by smoke-free policies. Your support of HB 2 shows commitment to improving health and saving lives. Thank you for standing up for the right to breathe smoke-free air. Sincerely, Jack Frost 44 Canal Center Plz Alexandria, VA 22314-1592

Subject: Thank Your Legislator for Improving Public Health with Smokefree

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: In honor of the Great American Smokeout, I'd like to thank you for making restaurants and bars in North Carolina smoke free. The Great American Smokeout is a day to encourage smokers to stop smoking for good. By passing a smoke-free law, North Carolina's government has made it that much easier for smokers to give up the deadly habit. Our smoke-free law will help protect smokers and non-smokers alike from the dangers of tobacco smoke. Smoking causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in North Carolina, and an additional 1,000 non-smokers die because of exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking costs North Carolina taxpayers $2.46 billion in direct healthcare costs, including $769 million in Medicaid expenses alone. Going smoke free will help change all that. Starting January 2, we'll be on the road to diminished health costs and lower death and disease rates. That's a lasting legacy to be proud of. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina, and please continue to support lifesaving policies. Sincerely, Christy Mason 146 Barbary Dr Statesville, NC 28677-9320

Subject: Thank Your Legislator for Improving Public Health with Smokefree

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: In honor of the Great American Smokeout, I'd like to thank you for making restaurants and bars in North Carolina smoke free. The Great American Smokeout is a day to encourage smokers to stop smoking for good. By passing a smoke-free law, North Carolina's government has made it that much easier for smokers to give up the deadly habit. Our smoke-free law will help protect smokers and non-smokers alike from the dangers of tobacco smoke. Smoking causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in North Carolina, and an additional 1,000 non-smokers die because of exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking costs North Carolina taxpayers $2.46 billion in direct healthcare costs, including $769 million in Medicaid expenses alone. Going smoke free will help change all that. Starting January 2, we'll be on the road to diminished health costs and lower death and disease rates. That's a lasting legacy to be proud of. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina, and please continue to support lifesaving policies. Sincerely, Alexandra Ball 430 Queens Rd Apt 611 Charlotte, NC 28207-1456

Subject: Thank Your Legislator for Improving Public Health with Smokefree

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: In honor of the Great American Smokeout, I'd like to thank you for making restaurants and bars in North Carolina smoke free. The Great American Smokeout is a day to encourage smokers to stop smoking for good. By passing a smoke-free law, North Carolina's government has made it that much easier for smokers to give up the deadly habit. The crusade to help people quit smoking and doing whatever it takes to arrest the obesity epidemic are the two most critical initiatives to curb the explosion in health care costs. Science plays a critical role and we should be engaged. Our public information channels need to broadcast constantly about the effects and dangers of smoking, overeating, and unhealthy eating. Smoking cessation is particularly critical. I am 68 years old and in my lifetime I've known very few adult smokers who had regular exercise programs. Physical inactivity and smoking almost invariably leads to weight gain, lung and heart damage and inordinately high medical costs for smokers. I know what I'm talking about -- I was a smoker. I had a heart attack. I have had angioplasties and a serious heart bypass operation. We need to help others to understand the health consequences of smoking. With the wisdom and leadership of you, our elected representatives, we are on the right path. Stay the course! I'm behind you. And, THANK YOU! Our smoke-free law will help protect smokers and non-smokers alike from the dangers of tobacco smoke. Smoking causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in North Carolina, and an additional 1,000 non-smokers die because of exposure to secondhand smoke.

Our smoke-free law will help protect smokers and non-smokers alike from the dangers of tobacco smoke. Smoking causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in North Carolina, and an additional 1,000 non-smokers die because of exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking costs North Carolina taxpayers $2.46 billion in direct healthcare costs, including $769 million in Medicaid expenses alone. Going smoke free will help change all that. Starting January 2, we'll be on the road to diminished health costs and lower death and disease rates. That's a lasting legacy to be proud of. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina, and please continue to support lifesaving policies. Sincerely, Sebrina McNeill 2807 Bainbridge Dr Apt F Durham, NC 27713-5430

By passing a smoke-free law, North Carolina's government has made it that much easier for smokers to give up the deadly habit. Our smoke-free law will help protect smokers and non-smokers alike from the dangers of tobacco smoke. Smoking causes nearly 12,000 deaths per year in North Carolina, and an additional 1,000 non-smokers die because of exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking costs North Carolina taxpayers $2.46 billion in direct healthcare costs, including $769 million in Medicaid expenses alone. Going smoke free will help change all that. Starting January 2, we'll be on the road to diminished health costs and lower death and disease rates. That's a lasting legacy to be proud of. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina, and please continue to support lifesaving policies. Sincerely, Marci Williams 307 Friendway Rd Greensboro, NC 27409-2117
