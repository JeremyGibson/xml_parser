Dear Governor Purdue: Thank you so very much for the stand you  have taken against the NC Supreme Court decision. My wife, Norma Jean Ehrhart, was murdered by Bobby Bowden in August, 1975. He took away my wife and mother of four children. Also two grandchildren, one a baby and unborn.
 
You have mine and my familie's deepest gratitude and respect. I hope you will reconsider your decision not to run for a second term. I know you would have five votes.
 
Sincerely,
 
Richard A Ehrhart
