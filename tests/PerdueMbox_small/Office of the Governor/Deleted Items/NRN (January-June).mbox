Governor Mike Easley



,

Dear Governor Easley,

I urge you to do everything in your power to see that our state enacts a version of "Jessica's Law." As you probably know, the Florida law was named in memory of 9-year old Jessica Lunsford, who was raped and killed by a repeat sex offender. The law establishes a minimum 25-year sentence for anyone convicted of molesting a young child. It also requires that paroled sex offenders wear a GPS positioning unit so police can keep track of them at all times. Research shows that criminals who prey on young children tend to repeat their crimes many times. Far too many young boys and girls have been brutalized by sex predators that should have been locked away. These abusers need to be kept off the streets and out of our neighborhoods. Enacting some form of "Jessica's Law" will protect our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, and will save lives. I hope you will get behind this legislation immediately. Thank you very much for your concern and your help.

Sincerely,

Cindy Foster

hello,

my name is Sobhi Algazali, a US citizen,  the husband and petitioner of ALHASHDY, DALAL. I filed a petition form I129F for my wife on May of 2008 receipt # EAC-08-156-52846 , during the processing time my wife was pregnant with my son Ameer sobhi Algazali. Her papers has been approved and were sent to the US embassy in Yemen on Dec. 30 2008. I was in Yemen when the baby was born and I got him a birth certificate and tried to go the US embassy to get him a passport, but they told me it takes about 3 months just to get an appointment to go and give them the birth certificate and apply for the passport and this time is a little bet too long. My question is,.  Is there anyway that I can add the baby to the petition/file so that he can come in with his mother and then apply for his US passport when he is here in the US? Because I called the USCIS before the baby was born and asked them what to do if the baby is born when his mother's papers are still pending. They told me to wait and if the baby is born when the papers aren't done to just write a letter telling them that I just had a baby and also to send his birth certificate, but now according to them, they dont have this case anymore and now its in the US embassy in Yemen. My wife is living on her own with the child because both of her parents are deceased. and I am a full time worker and a part time college student so I dont really get much time to travel back and forth. I would love to have them here with me and I really appreciate your help..

Sincerely,
Sobhi H. Algazali

Subject: fabulous innauguation

Comment: I had to write and tell you what a great innauguation ceremony today. I am so impressed with Governor Perdue. I moved away from n.c. some years ago, due to lack of jobs etc. and moved back a few years ago, and thought things were worse than they had ever been in the state. Now i have hope that there are better days ahead, not only the first female governor, but Gov. Perdue and her efforts to have transparent administration and the reforms needed in mental health and corrections and other areas of reform that you are undertaking. I am very active in government and politics, have been disabled for the last few years, but soon will be back working and hope to be able to volunteer more and maybe be more involved in progress and change needed in n.c. Thank you so much for your efforts. It is so refreshing to see the change you have already brought about, on day one! My best wishes to you and your family. My aunt and cousins, the Wards, live in new bern and i have visited there many times over the years.

> Yesterday a contentious public meeting was held by the Board of  Commissioners of Gaston County, NC as a result of the failed state inspection of their "dog pound" in December 2008. Approximately 60 people, including our NC state director who lives in Gaston County, attended. Approximately 10 people offered public testimony. As expected, Reggie Horton, the Director of Gaston Animal Control, and the Gaston County Board of Commissioners effectively sidestepped the important issues which were raised. Namely, violations of state laws. Lost animals getting killed within 24 hrs in violation of NCGS 130A-192, because, according to the vet who "euthanized" it, "it was old and skinny and blind." Apparently Gaston County Animal Control does not believe that pet owners have a right to have their lost pet returned to them if it is "old" or "skinny" or "blind."! Animals are refused to be held overnight even though rescue groups agreed to pick it up the next day. Gaston and many other NC counties apparently do not want to bother collaborating with rescue groups. Why should they? It means more work for them to answer calls, keep track of which groups wants which animals, etc.  The failed inspection stated that the disposition paperwork on the animals, which is required by state law to be created and preserved, was either incomplete or nonexistent. Either broken or no food or water bowls was common. Why feed the animals? They will be that much heavier to pick up after the automated gassing operation. There is much, much more, but the professional "sidestepping" job appears to have worked with the 60 plus animal people who attended (though not on all of course). The Board of Commissioners talked up "spay neuter," which has nothing to do with the above issues of mismanagement, and Reggie Horton told the media that "passions bring ! to the forefront good things for the animal community," and he blamed the "old" shelter  for his agency's violations. Needless to say none of the above-mentioned violations have anything to do with the old building as they relate only to Mr. Horton's  incapability or lack of desire to operate a shelter in compliance with the laws of North Carolina.  Watch the WSOC-TV Channel 9 news report at <http://www.wsoctv.com/waxntv/18443281/detail.html>http://www.wsoctv.com/waxntv/18443281/detail.html.

Dear Mr. Overcash:

I strongly oppose the Division of Air Qualitys plan to issue a draft air permit to Titan America for their proposed cement plant and limestone mine along the banks of the Northeast Cape Fear River near Castle Hayne, NC.

Currently North Carolina has no operating cement plant, and thus does not have adequate regulations for ozone, mercury, or carbon dioxide emissions from such facilities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release new mercury regulations specific to cement kilns by March 2009. Yet I understand you plan to issue a draft air permit for what would be the states fifth-highest mercury emitting facility by the end of this month.

Titan is asking to emit the maximum allowable amount of mercury (263 pounds) each year into our coastal environment, giving New Hanover County the fourth-highest mercury emissions in the state. Moreover, the proposed cement plant will also produce 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide, and thousands of tons of ozone and smog-causing pollution. These emissions were specifically targeted in our states ground-breaking Clean Smokestack Act (CSA) of 2002, which was passed with the overwhelming support of Governor Easley, the General Assembly, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the citizens of North Carolina to "help control North Carolinas biggest air pollution problems, thereby safe-guarding public health, improving visibility and protecting the environment." Though the CSA targeted power plants, it specifically directs the state to use all available resources and means to achieve comparable reductions in emissions from "other entities whose emissions negatively impact air quality i!
 n North Carolina."

Our state can import cement. We cannot import clean air and water. Therefore, I respectfully urge you to delay the issuance of Titan Americas draft air permit until adequate state and federal regulations are in place to control ozone, mercury, and carbon dioxide emissions from any cement plant operating in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Ursula Flugel

Dan:  I am not convinced you gave Robert Williams anything, but I did give you a copy of the photos of Tommy Pruett at Rutherford Electric and you made a copy of the letter I sent to Judge Larry Wilson which included a copy of the photo of Feb. 25, 2006 - I gave the same letter to Magistrate Pam Patterson on Sept. 7, 2006 when she allowed me to file a stalking charge against Tommy Pruett.   Gwynn Radeker prosecuted the case and when Tommy Pruett was caught lying on the witness stand for the second time, Judge Wilson glared at Radeker as if to say "don't you dare challenge his testimony".

Other people seen in court on Dec. 13, 2006 helping Tommy Pruett was his defense attorney Mark Lackey from Nov.20, 2006 who kept walking a jail-inmate back and forth in front and behind me, saying "excuse me sir" so loudly that I had to ask Judge Black to have Tommy Pruett repeat his testimony a couple of times.

Another was former ADA Lynn Broadway who prosecuted the rifle-assault charge against me in Superior Court on July 21, 2001.  According to records, she has a residency close to Robert Williams in Fallston.  You will recall our discussion about the reason she was dismissed by District Attorney Bill Young.

I believe the real reason Bill Young wants an excuse to put me in jail is that Bobby Ray and I found out Bill Young was dismissing charges against the drug dealers in Cleveland County - he dismissed 23 out of 28 charges against James Marion Gettys, and dismissed the assault and strong-arm robbery charge against sex offender Timothy James Keatley, Angel Pruetts' boyfriend-who lived with the Pruetts and beat-up Bobby Ray in Oct. 2000.  Another charge of "possession of a gun by a felon" by Det. Amy Stroupe was tried in Superior Court - Keatley was fined $625 and allowed to walk; then when Keatley was charged with "assault on a child under 12-years of age" he was run out of the county back to Wooster, Ohio where he stayed until moving to Zoarville, Oh.

It was Bobby Ray and I who saw Robert Williams in court in March 2002 with Timothy Keatley's brother John Mark Keatley, Jr. sitting beside their Mother - there was a Cadillac in the Catawba Co. Courthouse parking lot with Ohio plates, when Timothy Keatley was tried for molesting three-children in Newton, NC - Superion Court Judge Forrest D. Bridges presided over the case.  Bobby Ray saw a wanted poster for the Keeter children at Jerry's Mini Mart and contacted Lt. Robert Ward of the Forest City Police, Keatley helped his wife Melissa Lynn (Keeter) Keatley abduct her three children and took them to Wooster, Ohio - I spoke Lt. Ward and Sgt. Evansek after Bobby Ray died in April, 2005 about Timothy Keatley.  Lt. Ward said that a "skinny-kid" called Sgt. Evansek out to the lobby and slapped a handwritten subpoena in his hand saying "you been served" - Evansek threw it in the trash can - then a couple of days later District Attorney Bill Young called and told Lt. Ward the civil suit against Deputies Lawrence, Gibson, and King by Tommy Pruett had been "quashed" - that's the resisting-arrest charge that Tommy Pruett was found guilty of by Judge Anna F. Foster which I showed you on Nov. 20, 2006.  Everything comes back full-circle to Timothy J. Keatley - Robert A. Williams - Tommy R. Pruett, Sr. - District Attorney Bill Young - the Gettys Drug Trafficking and Deputy Mayrock "Rocky" Smith when you had me contact Deputy Dwyne Briscoe who I told about the Getty's and Tommy Pruett giving my first cousin Barbara Grayson Moses the overdose of drugs that were responsible for her death.

My court-appointed attorney Jerry Trammell said I had stopped the payoffs between the drug-dealers, lawyers, and judges in Cleveland County when I gave Deputy Briscoe the information about the Gettys Drug Trafficking network.

The Pruetts helped a friend of James Marion Gettys, Kevin Clifford Marks break-into my farm house on May 31, 2005 - Mother saw him during the breakin and I got his photo from the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office, which she identified.  I called 911 when I discovered my father WWII rifles had been stolen and when the Deputy did not take any fingerprints I called Sheriff Hamrick, who sent out Det.s Bryan Ledford and Amy Stroupe to my farmhouse - she took finger prints off a rusty doorknob and off an unused lightswitch.  You told me you could not get any other frints off the shell-boxes I gave to Chief-Deputy Danny Gordon.  Mother did not want to testify against Kevin Marks because of her age, and when I spoke with Det. Bryan Ledford he said they could not proceed without her testimony.

Though I am bothered by the suggestion that you think that I would have committed an unethical act and that I have been dishonest with you, I will not plead my innocence concerning these matters any longer, because I know that "a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still." and whether you accept what I have stated as truthful or not, is up to you.

I honestly wish and hope you have nothing but peace in your life, and truly hate the fact you have not had peace in a very long time.

Sincerely,

Dan Snellings 

another little "trick" I learned by copy & paste

I haven't had any peace in my life in the past 7-years because of the corruption in the Cleveland County judicial system and they just keep-on-and-keep-on letting Tommy Pruett file any charge he wants against me whether it's true or not - another reason for moving out of North Carolina.

Thanks for your response !

Buck,

I recall the photo you showed me of him driving passed in his truck pointing something with his right hand from inside of the cab . If I recall correctly, he was passing you from the right to left. You DID NOT give me that photograph! Other than holding it when you allowed me to view it, I have never been granted possession or entrusted with that photograph from you or anyone. NEVER..! You retained it immediately after I viewed it.

I believe you when you said you saw the photograph with Williams, but I maintain I have no knowledge of how he possessed it or from whom he got it, but it was not from me. And this is the truth and on the level. Further more, Robert Williams nor his people, or anyone who gets there jollies destroying people and or their lives, for their own gain and amusement, DO NOT warrant so much as a conversation with me. Though I would speak with them if a job related need arose, and then only in necessity and at a minimum.

I do not question your honesty about what happened in court.

I DID speak to Radeker after you came and spoke with me about the taser incident prior to your court date and interjected my two cents worth of opinion. Obviously what I said to him did not render any assistance in giving you a favorable out- come, though he appeared to listen to what I had to say at the time I spoke with him.

Though I am bothered by the suggestion that you think that I would have committed an unethical act and that I have been dishonest with you, I will not plead my innocence concerning these matters any longer, because I know that "a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still." and whether you accept what I have stated as truthful or not, is up to you.

I honestly wish and hope you have nothing but peace in your life, and truly hate the fact you have not had peace in a very long time.

Sincerely,

>> Dan:  My wife and I both saw the photos I gave you on Nov. 20, 2006 - (1)Tommy Pruett at Rutherford Electric in his white pickup truck, (2)the Feb. 25, 2006 photo I took of Tommy Pruett pointing something at me when he accused me of assault by pointing a gun.  Robert Williams had both in his possession on Dec. 13, 2006 sitting beside the Pruetts.

The question you asked me concerning the time I took the photo (2:30PM) on Feb. 25, 2006 came up in court with Tommy Pruett denying he was in the truck, or had passed me at that time of day because he was home taking a "nap".  Prosecutor Katie Sawyer asked Tommy Pruett if the truck in the photo (Feb. 25, 2006) was his and him driving - of course Tommy Pruett lied so badly the Judge ruled in my favor.

Everything else I said about Robert Williams is the truth, concerning his assistance to the Pruetts, and harassment of me and my wife in the courthouse - you can check with the Baliff (short eldery Deputy) - he had to walk us to my Cadillac out in the parking lot.

Deputies Ledbetter and Collins somehow knew what we had discussed about the taser-assault, legal issue of meeting before the trial, etc..  Talk to Gwynn Radeker about the Nov. 20, 2006 (trial) stalking charge I had filed against Tommy Pruett - he prosecuted the case for me and Judge Wilson helped Tommy Pruett's defense lawyer Mark Lackey, even providing a newer definition of what "stalking" meant.
Check out the case files and read the court transcripts, see if that's enough proof of what I am saying took place in court on Dec. 13, 2006.


We had to leave Cleveland County because of the Pruetts & Robert Williams and have our farm property up for sale <http://www.carolinaproperties.com/>www.carolinaproperties.com click on land search and then Be a proud owner of 70 acres, click on map link, satellite view ; AND we have moved out of the state of North Carolina.  Dr. Doug Stroud's wife is handling the property sale for us.  I would never return to that "Hell-Hole" of a county if it were not for my 92-year old Mother.

Drug Dealer James Marion Gettys lives at 2521 Eric Rd. on one side and Drug Runner Tommy Pruett lives at 3529 Fern Place on the other side of the farm property.  Mother informs me that the traffic down Eric Road has increased 10-fold since James Marion Gettys moved in with his Mother, Nancy (Daves) Gettys wife of Jimmy Walter Gettys, into her father's house. Paul Daves died a year ago.

Sorry for the misunderstanding !

Dear Mr. Overcash:

I strongly oppose the Division of Air Qualitys plan to issue a draft air permit to Titan America for their proposed cement plant and limestone mine along the banks of the Northeast Cape Fear River near Castle Hayne, NC.

Currently North Carolina has no operating cement plant, and thus does not have adequate regulations for ozone, mercury, or carbon dioxide emissions from such facilities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release new mercury regulations specific to cement kilns by March 2009. Yet I understand you plan to issue a draft air permit for what would be the states fifth-highest mercury emitting facility by the end of this month.

Titan is asking to emit the maximum allowable amount of mercury (263 pounds) each year into our coastal environment, giving New Hanover County the fourth-highest mercury emissions in the state. Moreover, the proposed cement plant will also produce 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide, and thousands of tons of ozone and smog-causing pollution. These emissions were specifically targeted in our states ground-breaking Clean Smokestack Act (CSA) of 2002, which was passed with the overwhelming support of Governor Easley, the General Assembly, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the citizens of North Carolina to "help control North Carolinas biggest air pollution problems, thereby safe-guarding public health, improving visibility and protecting the environment." Though the CSA targeted power plants, it specifically directs the state to use all available resources and means to achieve comparable reductions in emissions from "other entities whose emissions negatively impact air quality i!
 n North Carolina."

Our state can import cement. We cannot import clean air and water. Therefore, I respectfully urge you to delay the issuance of Titan Americas draft air permit until adequate state and federal regulations are in place to control ozone, mercury, and carbon dioxide emissions from any cement plant operating in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Daniel Larusso

Comment: I am a graduate in criminal law and am working on JD. degree. My sister-in-law- was here back in Ohio over the holidays. Her name is Tameron Himelrick. She was residing in Brunswick Co. There she got three misdemeanors and was sentenced to 90 days in North Carolina prison institution by the judge in Brunswick Co. Please help if you can, I intend to make this public U.S wide about the misuse of misdemeanor law and criminal felony law in your state. What kind of judge sentences that way? She is from Ohio and so is my brother whom is married Tameron. I full intend to turn this judge into a federal accusation and your state over this matter maam. In Ohio we don't sentence misdemeanors to prison? Are you still living rebel day in North Carolina. She has a son who is of mixed breed and I believe that this one factor that is causing this problem. I intend of writing the President and let him know some how that prejudice is still a substanial problem in your state, and i can prove it through my sister_in_law. You can ignore this if you like but I plan to expose North Carolina systems on thier harshness against blacks and those married to one.

President-Elect Obama Announces Top Pentagon Appointments

President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced last week that he plans to nominate William Lynn to be the new Deputy Secretary of Defense..

Lynn served as the Pentagon comptroller from 1997 to 2001. From 1993 to 1997, Lynn was the director of program analysis and evaluation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where he oversaw all aspects of the DoD's strategic planning process. He currently serves as senior vice president of Government Operations and Strategy at Raytheon [RTN].

Battle Lines Being Drawn On Hill Over Tanker Split Buy

A battle is brewing on Capitol Hill over whether to compel the Pentagon to buy aerial refueling tankers from each of the two firms battling for the Air Force contract, with influential lawmakers falling on both sides of the debate.

While powerful House members including Reps. John Murtha (D-Pa.) and Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii) have advocated a tanker split buy be pursued this year, backers of Boeing's [BA] tanker bid including Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) are digging in their heels regarding their opposition.

Coast Guard Continues To Explore Options For Land And Ship-Based UAVs

The Coast Guard is continuing to evaluate a number of different unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), including varieties used by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Navy, according to a Coast Guard official.

"Right now it would be correct to characterize...we are interested in all UAVs," Rear Adm. Gary Blore, assistant commandant for acquisition and chief acquisition officer, told reporters last month.

Panel Raps DoD Nuclear Oversight, Commends Navy

Nuclear oversight has eroded at all levels of the Defense Department, but the Navy mission has not suffered from the same difficulties found in the Air Force, according to a commission examining U.S. nuclear weapons oversight.

The Task Force on DoD Nuclear Weapons Management has recommended that an assistant secretary position responsible for coordinating the nuclear management be established in the Pentagon. The Pentagon should also give the Joint Chiefs of Staff a greater authority in nuclear oversight, the new report states.

Rapiscan Offers Airports, Airlines Cargo Screening Services to Generate Revenue

<http://www.uptilt.com/c.html?rtr=on&s=9ij,146d0,1h8r,3k34,8zgk,89qr,fl1z#story_1922>STORY FROM TR2

Rapiscan Systems is offering airports and airlines a way to find new and additional revenue sources as they and other nodes along the air cargo supply chain figure out how to comply with federal mandates that require all cargo being carried on passenger planes be screened for explosives during the next 18 months.

For example, third party screeners such as Rapiscan could compete to pay airports the right to set up a cargo screening facility at the airport that would inspect shipments for explosives prior to their being loaded onto a plane, Peter Kant, vice president for Global Government Affairs at Rapiscan, tells TR2. In turn, Rapiscan would charge the freight forwarder or Indirect Air Carrier to scan the cargo.

House-Autry Mills has been the choice of Southern cooks since 1812. House-Autry is fast approaching 200 years in continuous operation; most of that time at the original location in Newton Grove and since 2001 at our new state-of-the-art facility in Four Oaks. Our mission continues to be to deliver quality products consistently to our Retail consumers as well as our Foodservice customers. Our products are sold in about 30 states and we recently added a production facility in Marshall, Texas. We employ over 90 individuals, many of whom have been with us for many years. House-Autry continues to grind corn into meal on eleven (11) large grinding stones, but our primary products are breaders and coatings for frying and baking fish and seafood, chicken, pork, and vegetables. Our products contain all of the ingredients the consumer needs to make tasty dishes, just adding water, milk, or an egg-wash to moisten the product that will be breaded or coated. We still make our signature hushpuppy mixes, for which we are also famous. We are proud to be associated with the North Carolina Agribusiness Council and .The Choice of Southern Cooks since 1812.  

Washington NEWS
Etheridge, Butterfield Subcommittee Assignments: House Democrats announced subcommittees and other assignments for the 111th Congress. Bob Etheridge (D-NC) will serve on the Trade and Oversight committees. For the House Energy and Commerce subcommittees, G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) will serve on the Energy and Environment subcommittee, Communications, Technology, and the Internet subcommittee, and the Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection subcommittee. The assignments are subject to ratification by the House Democratic Caucus.
Vilsack Confirmation Hearing Set: U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin says the confirmation hearing for former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack as the nation's next agriculture secretary will be on Jan. 14. President-elect Barack Obama chose Vilsack for the post.

Immigration NEWS
Changes to H2A Program Raise Groups' Ire: Farm worker advocates and opponents of illegal immigration are blasting one of President Bush's "midnight regulations" that will make it easier for agricultural employers to hire foreign workers. They say the changes undermine worker protections, exploit immigrants and set wage levels so low that domestic workers cannot compete with foreign workers for jobs. The regulation, which makes changes in the H-2A Temporary Agriculture Worker Program, allows agricultural employers to hire temporary foreign workers if not enough domestic workers are able or willing to fill farm jobs. The changes also promise to reduce paperwork and make processing deadlines more efficient. They are expected to take effect Jan. 17, three days before President-elect Barack Obama takes office. Midnight regulations are rules pushed by the executive branch in the waning days of a lame-duck president's term. However, the incoming president is free to revise or revoke such last-minute changes.

Commodity NEWS
Salmonella Outbreak Sickens 388 Across U.S: An outbreak of salmonella food poisoning has made 388 people sick across 42 states, sending 18 percent of them to the hospital, U.S. health officials said on Wednesday. The CDC is trying to trace the source of the outbreak, which began in September. Only Ohio state health officials have agreed to have their state named as one of those affected, with an estimated 50 cases.
Doubled Quota Positions U.S. Pork For Growth in Russia: The doubling of the country-specific tariff rate quota for U.S. pork could pave the way for boosting export opportunities in Russia, according to U.S. Meat Export Federation economist Erin Daley. Following recent negotiations between Russia and the US, the quota was raised to 220.5 million pounds per year from 110.9 million pounds per year. According to Daley, Russia is trying to grow its domestic pork industry, but it currently doesn't have sufficient domestic production to meet its growing needs. Russian processors especially will continue to rely on pork imports, and the upped quota will help make U.S. pork more affordable to Russia, she said.
Egg Sets, Chicks Placed Decline: Commercial hatcheries in the 19-state weekly program set 203 million eggs in incubators during the week ended Jan. 3, 2009, down 7 percent from the eggs set the corresponding week a year earlier, according to USDA. Broiler growers in the program placed 169 million chicks for meat production during the week ended Jan. 3, 2009, down 5 percent from the comparable week a year earlier. Cumulative placements from Dec. 30, 2007, through Jan. 3, 2009, were 9.12 billion, down 2 percent from the same period a year ago.
Analyst Predicts Modest Hog Profits: Modest gains in hog prices and lower cost of production should return hog producers to profitability in 2009 after six consecutive quarters of losses, according to Purdue University Extension Economist Chris Hurt. In 2008, the estimated cost for average farrow-to-finish producers was near $53 per live hundredweight with prices about $48, resulting in losses of about $5 per hundredweight or near $15 per head. For 2009, costs are expected to approach $50 with prices about $51, for profits of $1 per live hundredweight or about $3 per head. Hurts forecasts assume that 2009 corn prices decline by about 60 cents per bushel and soybean meal falls by about $25 per ton from cash prices on Jan. 5. He also assumes slaughter supplies will be down 2 percent in 2009, based on USDA's latest Hogs and Pigs report that showed reduced breeding and market herds. Hurt expects reduced pork exports in 2009 to be offset by an increased U.S. population, making domestic per capital pork availability unchanged from 2008.

Business NEWS
Grants Available from Tobacco Trust Fund Commission: Current economic and job conditions have accelerated the implementation of a new grant cycle from the North Carolina Tobacco Trust Fund Commission (NCTTF).

Belmont Textile Company to Close After a Century: R.L. Stowe Inc. has announced it is closing after almost 108 years in the sales yarn business. The firm employees 550 people in two Belmont plants and two plants in Chattanooga and Lupton City, Tenn. President and CEO Harding Stowe said that "business conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated suddenly and dramatically." Stowe said management doesn't see sales returning to levels sufficient to remain in business.
NC Opens Foreign Trade Office in Shanghai: North Carolina has opened its second foreign trade office in China after it grew into the state's second-largest export market after Canada. Commerce Secretary Jim Fain said Thursday that the office opened in the eastern Chinese metropolis of Shanghai last week. There was already a North Carolina trade office in the southern city of Hong Kong. North Carolina businesses exported $1.73 billion in products to China through October. China is the leading destination for items leaving the Port of Wilmington.

Environmental NEWS
EPA and Perdue Farms Sign Water Protection Initiative: The U.S. EPA announced an agreement with Md.based Perdue Farms to implement a four-year program aimed at protecting waters in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Under the new four-year, environmental management program, Perdue, EPA and their partners will provide training and assistance to poultry farmers so that they can learn how to achieve or exceed compliance with guidelines for controlling runoff and managing litter disposal.

Commissioners Form Voluntary Agricultural District: A voluntary agricultural district was formed by the Craven County Board of Commissioners on Monday to help identify and protect county farms.

USDA NEWS
Secretary Recommends Soybean Checkoff Audit: The USDA has informed the American Soybean Association (ASA) that Secretary Schafer has signed a memorandum recommending that USDAs Office of Inspector General (OIG) conduct an audit and, as appropriate, investigation of the National Soybean Checkoff Program based on the petition filed by the ASA on Dec. 10, 2008. ASAs petition calls for an investigation of the United Soybean Board (USB) and the U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC) to ensure that soybean checkoff dollars are being managed and invested as prescribed by law.

Subject: CHILD SUPPORT WORKERS

Comment: My question is I have a father who has changed jobs 3 times this yr and Im glad he has a job but I think that DSS here in Catawba County isnt fair. There dad filed to modify my case in Nov 20 due to an increase in pay & our daughters braces being paid for. So how does it work when he started his new job 12/1 at MDI.He has yet to tell my regular case worker that he changed job. For the past three times this has happened I have had to tell them he changed jobs. Why is that? What do they do all day they cant do something about this? I have 2 kids by this man & he is now married. I know he doesnt turn in his wifes income which she makes very good $$. I am so upset with the system that when we go to court Thursday 1/15 im asking a judge to look into it. How can you base someones income on a job that they no longer work at? The system is failing us single parents. the last support i received was 12/18 & he has to be behind 1month of payment in order for them to issue a court date. I have missed more work going through this 3times this yr but yet when i talk to both of my case workers I get an attiude. They are suppose to be on our side and yet i feel like they are on his side. What case worker just goes by word and the other case worker dont even know whats goin on. After jan 31 she said they will issue a court date for him for support owed but they did that last time in april of 08 and nothing was done he was behind about 800.00 i didnt see a dime of it. I am just so sick of the system failing us single parents trying to make it. For him to start another job 12/1/08 he should of contacted the regular case worker and payment should of start within a week or so instead of waiting till 1/15 of our court date and the support will go into effect 2/1 like always and not getting a child support check until prob mid Feb Right now the arrears owed to my kids is $1473.04 & come Jan 31 will be up to $2000.00. So, my question to you is how can this be handled? I know there is alot of dead beat dads but why do they let people like my kids father get away with not turning in the correct information after i told them he changed jobs and just waiting till the court date to do something? Sincerely so upset with the system, Crystal Canipe

Subject: Health Care Employee Comp. System

Comment: Dear Gov.Pudue: Congratulations to you on your win in the general elections and being sworn in as Governor of our state of North Carolina! My name is Bobby Rauf. I am former 1st Vice Chair of Cleveland County Democratic party and a proud supporter of your bid for the office of Governor for North Carolina. We will continue to root for you and support you in Cleveland County and we wish you best of luck. I would like to bring an important issue to your attention as you assume your duties as our Governor. This issue has to do with implementation of the Beacon Compensation Program being enforced by the current Controller reporting to Governor Easley. Under the program being enforced by the current Controller, Physicians working in our State Hospitals, such as Cherry Hospital, are NOT being compensated fairly for the overtime worked by the physicians. These physicians and the hospital management have already petition and brought the matter to controllers attention, but in vain. As you take on the governance of our state, your investigation and attention into this matter would be greatly appreciated by state health care providers and the patients who need the care so critically. Thanks, in advance, for your time and attention in this matter. Bobby Rauf (336) 596-3826 129 Camille Drive Shelby, NC 28150

While I voted for Gov. Perdue and it won't impact my decision to vote on her re-election in 2012, as a North Carolinian I find it somewhat ridiculous that our new Governor's official web site features the "First Dogs," yet makes scant mention of her actual children.  I realize the children may be grown and may want to be out of the limelight so to speak, but in the eyes of some it could be construed as ignoring the kids in favor of the dogs... and while I'm sure whoever designed the site had good intentions in mind, the end result just doesn't work.  Perhaps including some more generic detail about the Governor's children, and/or scaling back the "First Dogs" area from its own page to a paragraph and photo, would be in order.

Subject: Gouging

Comment: Dear Governor First of all congratulations. I have noticed that we as North Carolinians are still paying fuel charges even though the cost of oil and fuel has decreased to a point that is below where most companies had begun charging fuel charges. Just this week I notices my Dominion Electric bill has a nearly 9.00 fuel charge on it as did a shipment I made via UPS. Isn't this a form of price gouging? Shouldn't these charges be removed across the State as the cost of the fuel has decreased to below "pre- fuel charge" levels?
