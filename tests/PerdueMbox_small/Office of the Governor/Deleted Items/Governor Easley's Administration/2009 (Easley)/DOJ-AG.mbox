My name is Kassie and my fiancee Chadwick Davis was extradicted to Shreveport LA on Tuesday 12/30/08. The transport agency that picked him up was in an accident and he was injured. Louisanna says that they do not use agencies that they have detectives that come to get inmates they are extradicting. New Hanover Co. Jail has no idea who came to get him and he has not yet arrived in Louisanna. No one will help me. Louisanna says he missed a court date that his interstate probation knew nothing of. I had to send Louisanna money in order to get the court minutes that had the court date on them. I am really worried and am issuing a missing persons report on Monday morning if I haven't heard anything. My number is 910-616-0035. Thank you for your time. Have a good day.
