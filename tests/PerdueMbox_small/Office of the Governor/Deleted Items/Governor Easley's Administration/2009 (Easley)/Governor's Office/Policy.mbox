The Census Bureau has discovered that the background work they thought they had done on Wake County has not been completed. Therefore, they prefer not to use Wake as the initial county in the reporting of precincts (or "voting tabulation districts") for the 2010 Census. After consultation with Gary Bartlett and affected county election directors, we are proposing to use Mecklenburg County instead. All counties will be reported eventually. Please indicate if you have any objection to using Mecklenburg instead of Wake as the initial county. Thanks.

Please see attached. This is to designate the initial, test county for submitting North Carolina's Voting Tabulation District  (VTD) boundaries to the Census Bureau for inclusion as block boundaries in the 2010 Census. Later this year, VTDs for the remainder of the counties will be submitted. Please contact us if you have any questions. Thanks.
