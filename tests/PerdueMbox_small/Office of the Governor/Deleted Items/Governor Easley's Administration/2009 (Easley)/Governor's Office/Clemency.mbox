She mentions a pardon below, as well as “changing the law.” Since she’s in touch with her legislator I didn’t want to send the “call your legislator” response. Let me know if you think you can respond or if I need to tell her we can’t help with a legal matter.



Thanks!

Kelley

I have sent this attached email to Jason Cannon who works for Julia C. Howard, my General Assembly Representative for Davie and Iredell County. I need help! I need to find out either what I can do to fight this new law or how we go about getting him pardoned.
