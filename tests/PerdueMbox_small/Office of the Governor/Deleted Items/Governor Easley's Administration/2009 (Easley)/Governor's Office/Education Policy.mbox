Dear Mr. Mitchem,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding North Carolina Education Lottery funds.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Easley.



In August 2005, Governor Easley signed into law the North Carolina State Lottery Act (House Bill 1023) and the 2005 Appropriations Act (Senate Bill 622) which established the North Carolina Education Lottery.  Funds are specifically earmarked for a variety of education related programs, such as class size reduction and college scholarships.



For a complete breakdown of where the money goes, you can visit <http://www.lottery.nc.gov/>www.lottery.nc.gov and click on “Where the Money Goes.”



Thank you so much for writing and sharing your concerns with our office.



Best to you,

Governor Easley’s Education Policy Team

Dear Ms. Welsh,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding the frustration your daughter is experiencing with her high school classes at Havelock High School.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Easley.



First, I am sure you are very proud to have such an intelligent and motivated daughter.  I am positive she will continue to thrive as she begins to pursue higher education.



If you have not already done so, I would suggest you speak with Brittany’s guidance counselor regarding her options on taking the classes that are not being offered at her school.  There are 2 other high schools in your county as well as the Craven Early College High School.  In fact, you may look into the possibility of Brittany taking classes through the Early College.  Additionally, you mentioned online courses as well.  I would suggest you contact The University of North Carolina at Greensboro’s I-School.  You can get information regarding the online coursework by visiting <http://web.uncg.edu/dcl/web/ischool/>http://web.uncg.edu/dcl/web/ischool/ .



Thank you for contacting our office and for being such a strong advocate for Brittany.



Best,

Governor Easley’s Education Policy Team

I do apologize, I meant to send this email to you as well.

Thank you....

Hello everyone,

Hopefully I am contacting the people that will be able to help my daughter
complete her high school education on a positive note. My daughter, Brittany
Welsh currently attends Havelock High School in Havelock, NC and has since
moving to Havelock at the beginning of her ninth grade year.

Brittany is an excellent student, person, and daughter; no I am not saying that
because she is mine. Brittany works hard to achieve good grades and to reach her
goal to become an author. Although Havelock High School has repeatedly let her
down she has always picked herself back up and proven that she can make it.

Today (Friday, January 9, 2009) Havelock High School has broken her spirit and
wounded her motivation to complete her Senior year. She called me to pick her up
early in tears.

Brittany is a smart kid who works hard. Throughout her time at Havelock High
School she has been in Honors English courses. Ninth grade was great, tenth
grade she moved on to Creative Writing I, Eleventh grade she was told that
Creative Writing II would not be offered for her Eleventh grade year (the reason
is eluding me at this time) and finally we come to her Senior year.

Brittany had enough credits to only have to attend the first semester of school
to earn her credits to graduate. When her and I went to the school to get her
schedule adjusted to reflect graduating early we were told that her Honors
English course was only offered second semester, fourth period. All chances of
her graduating early went out the door. We were then told that she had to choose
between specific courses because she was not allowed to have a break in her
schedule. This disappointed her but, she chose courses that she might enjoy just
because she HAD to.

Now at the end of the first semester she is told that her Honors English course
only has six to eight kids so they are canceling the class. Her options, drop
down to regular English and be bored just to gain her final graduation credit,
or join distance learning for her Honors course. By the way, the online honors
course is being monitored by the HONORS TEACHER!

Mr. Murphy says that he was approved for the teacher to monitor the online
learning but was not approved for a class with only six to eight children so
that they can learn in an actual class room with actual students sitting in the
class to brain storm together. So, if the Honors Teacher is allowed to sit in a
computer lab with the honors students to attend online learning, why is she not
allowed to hold the actual class? She is being paid either way, right?

Today Brittany calls me in tears to pick her up because they have canceled yet
another course on her. One of the courses she chose because she had to fill in
the blank spot. Physics. What kid chooses to take Physics?? Brittany did not
merely want to skate by, she wanted something that mattered and challenged her.

There must be something that can be done for her and the other children who are
fighting the same battle. She feels as if she is being punished for being in
higher learning courses; no child that is helping themselves succeed should be
made to feel like this.

Please help me help her. She is such a bright kid, she does not deserve the
short end of the stick that she has had these past few years and definitely not
her Senior year in high school.

Thank you,

Tammy Welsh
