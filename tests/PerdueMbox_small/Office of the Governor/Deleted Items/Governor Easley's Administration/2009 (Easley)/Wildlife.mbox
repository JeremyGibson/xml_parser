No reply is necessary to Mr. Benton. He sent this same message to most of the Wildlife Commissioners and to the agency.  We have documented his opinions on the rules proposals and they will be included in the public comment summaries presented to the Commissioners after the state-wide public hearings are complete.  Thank you.



Best regards,

Subject: 2009-2010 Hunting Proposals



First of all I would like to thank you for your time.

I’m writing in regard to some of the 2009-2010 Hunting proposals.

I have voted but would like to comment on just a couple.

H5 - Extending Muzzleloading a week. I SUPPORT

One of the biggest opponents of this is the North Carolina Bowhunters Association. I understand that it would take a week away from the Archery season but would they feel the same if the roles were reversed, meaning taking a week away from muzzleloading or regular gun season and adding a week to Archery, my guess is NOT. I would personally love to see two weeks of muzzleloading. I know some people that do not hunt muzzleloading season because it was not benificial to purchase a muzzleloader for just one week but have said that if it was extended to two weeks that they would start. I would even be open to taking away week of regular gun season to add the second week of muzzleloading that way the bowhunters would not loose that week.

H28 – Use of Crossbows. I SUPPORT

Just in case you haven’t read the NCBA take on this here it is:

NOTE: NCBA will continue to OPPOSE legalization of crossbows in North Carolina. Currently,  state law forbids anyone from purchasing a crossbow without first obtaining a special permit. There appears to be some problem too with the legal and accepted definition of "archery equipment", of which crossbows do not conform with.
We are not sure the WRC has the legal authority to simply legalize crossbows for hunting. We are checking into this. Also,  the definitions of bows, arrows, etc.,  do not cover the physical characteristics of crossbows, and are not considered "archery equipment", by the accepted definition by experts in the sport. The chairman (Wes Seegars) announced at the Thursday night WRC meeting in Brevard (Oct. 2, 2008) that he had been contacted by the ATA (Archery Trade Association), and that they were "eccstatic" about the possibility of crossbows being legalized in N.C.,  because "They will make a lot of money on the sale of them."  So,  now the WRC is going to support big bow manufacturers making a lot of money, but NOT our local archery dealers, many of whom will lose their businesses and livelihood if these proposals are approved. The NCBA will continue to oppose legalization of crossbows in N.C.  They are NOT bows, and they don't shoot arrows.  They are big and cumbersome to carry around. They are dangerous to use by even a normal man who has no physical impairment. And, they are NOT as easy to use as advertised.  They are NOT as effective and accurate as they are advertised to be. They do NOT belong in bow only seasons for sure, and do NOT need to be legalized in N.C. for anyone other than legitimate handicapped persons,  as the law now provides for.

This response is a complete JOKE. These are very lame excuses not to allow crossbows. I used to bow hunt but hurt my right shoulder and it’s hard for me to pull a bow back but I do not qualify to obtain a license to use a crossbow. The use of crossbows would expand my hunting season again.

Once again thank you for your time.

Dear Sir: Is there any way you could extend the deer hunting season this year in the Central and North Western counties this year. The weather hasn't been cooperating, so the deer just aren't moving like they should? I know the insurance companies would apreciate it, and so would all of the other unemployed workers like me. Thank You Trent Brady













 Dear Mr. Brady,



Governor Michael Easley forwarded your inquiry about extending the deer season to this office for a response.  The NC Wildlife Resources Commission undertakes the rulemaking process every year and offers rule proposals for consideration by the Wildlife Resources Commission, frequently to address issues such as the one you have mentioned. The proposals result from a thorough analysis and review of best practices for wildlife conservation and management. The WRC works hard to balance responsible stewardship of our wildlife resources with providing additional opportunities and satisfaction for the state’s hunters, anglers, and outdoors enthusiasts.    The rule proposals are introduced and vetted among interested sportsmen and women for comments and suggestions at state-wide public hearings in January, prior to consideration by the entire Commission.



Currently there are several rule proposals under consideration regarding deer seasons.  All the rule proposals may be found on our website at <http://www.ncwildlife.org/ProposedRegulations/Main.aspx>http://www.ncwildlife.org/ProposedRegulations/Main.aspx . You can register your opinion on the website, write a lengthier e-mail with your opinions or ideas to <mailto:regulations@ncwildlife.org>regulations@ncwildlife.org , or send us a letter at:

NC Wildlife Resources Commission
Proposed Regulations Comments
1701 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, N.C. 27699-1701



Proposal H3 is to remove the daily bag limit for deer, which will increase hunting opportunities.

Proposal H6 and H7 would establish a single uniform Deer Season on private lands and/or game lands, with a structure matching the current Eastern Deer Season in the counties of Yancey, McDowell, and Rutherford and ALL counties east of them. This season would offer more hunting opportunities for hunters in the Central, Northwestern and Western Deer seasons. 



There are other proposals concerning deer hunting and deer seasons that you may find interesting as well. After the comments from the public hearings and correspondence to the agency have been tallied, the proposals will be considered for adoption by the Wildlife Resources Commission at its meeting in Raleigh on March 4, 2009.  Please note that any rules adopted by the Wildlife Resources Commission at the March 2009 meeting will become effective in the 2009-2010 hunting season. 



I hope you will look at the Rules Proposals and add your opinions.  You may also attend the public hearings and voice your opinions there.  Please see <http://www.ncwildlife.org/news_stories/pg00_NewsRelease/2009_10_public_hearing_booklet.pdf>http://www.ncwildlife.org/news_stories/pg00_NewsRelease/2009_10_public_hearing_booklet.pdf for the schedule of public hearings, dates, time and locations. 



Thank you for your interest in hunting and the management of North Carolina’s deer population.  If we may be of assistance to you or provide you with more information please don’t hesitate to contact me by e-mail or at the number below.



Sincerely,

Betsy Foard
