Subject:        Customer complaint (Karen Pearson)

In reference to complaint from Karen Pearson on the Concord Driver License office:
I called 704 784-1328 and spoke with the Mother of Karen Pearson. She stated that Ms. Pearson was not at home at the time and so I gave my name and the reason for my call. She stated that she could give me some information. She stated that Karen and her family had lost their home in Michigan and have moved to North Carolina. They went to the Concord Driver license office and they felt that everyone at the office was rude and snippy and degrading. I asked if she could give me some details so that I could make sure to take care of the problems. She stated that they would take the required papers and that the family had lost the box that contained the Birth Certificates and that the 18 year old had to show proof of residence. She could not give me specific details.

I tried to find out names of the staff and the dates the Pearson's visited the office and she could not remember. She just stated that the lady at the front desk was rude and that all of the staff was rude except for one lady and one of the men. She still could not identify them.

I left my name and cell phone number with the lady I spoke with and asked that she give the information to Ms. Pearson in case she wanted to give me a call. She stated that she would let her know and that they just felt like they should let someone know. She thanked me for calling and thanked me for DMV's attention to this matter.

I apologized for the unpleasant experience by the family and thanked her for letting us know.
I asked if there was anything more I could do for her family and she stated that they had all received their licenses and Thanked me again for calling her.

I will talk to the Senior Examiner in reference to this matter.

Cindy,

Mrs. Kisiah's license was renewed today and it will expire in 2017.  When I spoke with Mr. Kiash, he was not aware of this.  Mr. Kiash inquired about his daughter's license and I told him that I would have to research the situation.  When I spoke with the Joe Franze,District Supervisor he advised that the daughter 's legal presence document expires in June 09, therefore the expiration on any issuance would be the same date. I advised Mr. Franze to contact Mr. Kiash regarding this matter and he did.
Thank you

It's kind of hard to determine the issue, but I think it's that he's not happy with the customer service of his local DMV.
Thanks.

How is it that my wife and daughter who are permanent residence of the United States cannot get their driver’s license renewed because they are holding a conditional card. USCIS makes no distinctions between a permanent residence card and a conditional permanent residence card. They were also treated like crap at the DMV office.

I called and left my name and direct number for Ms. Bellamy to return my call.
I reviewed her record, she took care of a 2002 safe movement violation in Brunswick Co. that occurred while she was under suspension for fta on a 1997 fta for seatbelt violation.
I will provide her this info. once she returns my call.

Dear Governer Easley:
My name is Catherine Bellamy. On November 19th 2008 my father died due to a massive heart attack. He left me his 10 year old adopted son Tristan Miles who he has had since he child was six months old. I need a license to keep this child well and make his appointments. He has FAS and ADHD. I recently paid some fine that I will admit were well overdue. After this I went and got insurance and headed to the NCDMV. There they told me that my license was scheduled for revoction because one of my tickets I got while my license was suspended in 1998. I am in college and have been carrying at least a 3.0 GPA for a year now. I know these are just excuses to you and that you have probably heard them all before. I am scared that if I do not get my license (or at least a driving privilege) that I will loose my brother to social services. I know my past was a bad one, but I have changed my life around for almost 3 years now. I have made so many positive changes. I need your help. Please if there i s anything you can do to help me I would greatly appreciate it. I do not know how I could repay you but if I had to pick up trash on the highway I would. Please governor, I need your help. I need you to help me prove that your past mistakes do not always have to affect your future. Thank you for your time and sorry if I have wasted it.

Sincerely,
Catherine Samantha Bellamy

Charlotte,
I spoke with Ms. Bellamy and explained that the reason for her suspension was due to a moving violation during a period of suspension.
I gave her the info. on the 1997 fta that had her suspended when she was stopped in 2002 and explained that the only way we could deleted that fta was if the court said it was in error or provided on order striking the fta.
I also explained that if the 2002 citation was reduced to a non moving violation or dismissed that it would also remove her suspension.
