Dear Governor Easley,

We will no longer stand by and watch as America's national security
and
economy become more dependent on the unstable foreign nations that we
rely on for nearly 70% of the oil we use each day.

We spend nearly $700 billion every year buying foreign oil, which
represents the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.

The new President and the 111th Congress need to enact an energy plan
that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least 30% within ten
years.

This plan must include proven American technology and resources; the
development of new energy sources; and the expansion and modernization
of the national electrical grid to transport renewable energy to homes
and businesses.

Delaying any further means tacit support for continuing America's
addiction to foreign oil.

I urge you to join with T. Boone Pickens and his army of supporters in
calling for an Energy Independence Plan to be enacted within the first
100 days of the new administration.

Sign the pledge at http://www.pickensplan.com/thepledge/.

Dear Governor Easley,

We will no longer stand by and watch as America's national security
and
economy become more dependent on the unstable foreign nations that we
rely on for nearly 70% of the oil we use each day.

We spend nearly $700 billion every year buying foreign oil, which
represents the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.

The new President and the 111th Congress need to enact an energy plan
that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least 30% within ten
years.

This plan must include proven American technology and resources; the
development of new energy sources; and the expansion and modernization
of the national electrical grid to transport renewable energy to homes
and businesses.

Delaying any further means tacit support for continuing America's
addiction to foreign oil.

Dear Governor Easley,

We will no longer stand by and watch as America's national security
and
economy become more dependent on the unstable foreign nations that we
rely on for nearly 70% of the oil we use each day.

We spend nearly $700 billion every year buying foreign oil, which
represents the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.

The new President and the 111th Congress need to enact an energy plan
that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least 30% within ten
years.

This plan must include proven American technology and resources; the
development of new energy sources; and the expansion and modernization
of the national electrical grid to transport renewable energy to homes
and businesses.

Delaying any further means tacit support for continuing America's
addiction to foreign oil.

I urge you to join with T. Boone Pickens and his army of supporters in
calling for an Energy Independence Plan to be enacted within the first
100 days of the new administration.

Sign the pledge at http://www.pickensplan.com/thepledge/.

Dear Governor Easley,

We will no longer stand by and watch as America's national security
and
economy become more dependent on the unstable foreign nations that we
rely on for nearly 70% of the oil we use each day.

We spend nearly $700 billion every year buying foreign oil, which
represents the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.

The new President and the 111th Congress need to enact an energy plan
that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least 30% within ten
years.

This plan must include proven American technology and resources; the
development of new energy sources; and the expansion and modernization
of the national electrical grid to transport renewable energy to homes
and businesses.

Delaying any further means tacit support for continuing America's
addiction to foreign oil.

I urge you to join with T. Boone Pickens and his army of supporters in
calling for an Energy Independence Plan to be enacted within the first
100 days of the new administration.

Sign the pledge at http://www.pickensplan.com/thepledge/.

Dear Governor Easley,

We will no longer stand by and watch as America's national security
and
economy become more dependent on the unstable foreign nations that we
rely on for nearly 70% of the oil we use each day.

We spend nearly $700 billion every year buying foreign oil, which
represents the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind.

The new President and the 111th Congress need to enact an energy plan
that reduces our foreign oil dependence by at least 30% within ten
years.

This plan must include proven American technology and resources; the
development of new energy sources; and the expansion and modernization
of the national electrical grid to transport renewable energy to homes
and businesses.

Delaying any further means tacit support for continuing America's
addiction to foreign oil.

I urge you to join with T. Boone Pickens and his army of supporters in
calling for an Energy Independence Plan to be enacted within the first
100 days of the new administration.

Sign the pledge at http://www.pickensplan.com/thepledge/.

Sincerely,

Burks Crumpler
