Live rounds in the chamber
Thugs
I was thinking that they use these thugs all around the world,
To intimidate people while doing research, and investigations,
And also use these thugs to exterminate people, and they the transplant another group of people and under some deceit and exterminate them as well.

This seems to be the very situation here in the United States of America.
I believe that these folks here are inclined to use or to be thugs,
And so they continue to attempt impose their will illegally, and unlawfully, in such a manner as to coerce, intimidate, interfere with privacy, and interfere with property,
And interfere with liberty, and interference with freedom, and interference with
Righthts, etc.

Again, I said that the note regarding “pests” was a lie. It was a solicitation, part of a conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, part of a conspiracy to interfere with property, and part of a conspiracy to trespass, and part of a conspiracy to interfere with liberty and part of a conspiracy to use thuggery and to use force, or the fear of force to prevent tenants from leave, or coming as they please, or to prevent tenants from speaking or associating with the proper authorities.

Depraved Hearts
At Cross Purposes
Jigalows

This morning my thoughts were as follows as I walked to the Central Division
To make a “restatement”.
“This will not be a crime that remains unsolved.”
This will no be a crime that will go in the Unsolved Mysteries Files.
You might as well deputize me now.
I entered the police station and spoke Greetings and salutations to the desk officer and the sergeant this morning. I made my ‘restatement” about the owners of this building and their attempts to illegally conscript me into a menu of crooked, corrupt and criminal activities because this is the established order down here in the downtown area.
I mentioned that we are at cross purposes, because of their depraved hearts. I have taken religious vows, which precludes, and precedes and supercedes their desires and wishes to corrupt me. All of the things which delight them so, I declare to be abominable, including their conspiracy to trespass, invasion of privacy, vandalism, interference with property, breaking and entering, burglary. I also mentioned that I gave them a plate of cookies for Christmas, and they not only ate the cookies, they also stole the plate and are concealing it and with holding it. I am not their problem Their sins are their problem.
And so, I made objections to the sergeant and two officers this morning regarding these depraved hearts.
Depraved hearted Baptists
Depraved hearted Methodists
Depraved hearted Catholics
Depraved hearted Presbyterians
Depraved hearted Disciples of Christ
Depraved hearted Lutherans
Depraved hearted Episcopalians
Depraved hearted Anglicans
Depraved hearted Buddhists
Depraved hearted Atheists
Depraved hearted Gnostics
Depraved hearted Coptics
Depraved hearted Wiccans
Depraved hearted Thelemics
Depraved hearted Transcendentalists
Depraved hearted Kaballists
Depraved hearted Christian Scientists
Depraved hearted Jehova’s Witnesses
Depraved hearted Believers
Depraved hearted unbelievers
Depraved hearted Seventh Day Adventists
Depraved hearted African Methodists Episcopals
Depraved hearted Pentecostals
Depraved hearted Church of God In Christ
Depraved hearted Apostolics
Depraved hearted Metaphysicists
Depraved hearted Congregationalists
Depraved hearted Salvationsts



And so, these are mysteries, very strange dichotomies. And I think these mysteries have something to do with “mind control” and attempts at “mind control” hypnotism, mesmerism.

Reflectiosx,

Today I telepohoned the FBI all of the proper authorities regarding this situation with the Central Intelligence Agency, and the foreign entities. They were listening, but also they were unable to do anything. And so, as I told them I am doing anger management.
Because these are folks who are attempting to include me, adopt me induct me into their family life, with themselves, husband wife and children. And I am not interested. I am not at all interested in participating in that kind of situation a t all. They have been following me around all day, trying get the husband and the male children to be my lords an masters. That is just not going to be the case. They are misinformed. I don’t know why they are misinformed. But I suspect that there are Federal Bureaucrats, and State Bureaucrats behind most of the criminal intentions that seem to be afoot.

Now how this situation seems to be arranged is that the men of a community claim to have control over the women of a community and so the men make some kind of pact of agreement for the supplying of the time, talents, and labor of the women. That seems to be what is going on here. Something like that. And this all is arranged without the knowledge or consent of the women in some of these countries, and so they are trying this out in the United States of America.

And so, this cannot be the case. I am not going to be involved with this. They may go to the Bishop or Archbishop and ask to do something. He may give his consent, but the situation here in America which is still free country, is that we have laws against what the Bishop may give his consent to. Such as a ban or enslavement of people, women and children and men. So in other words what they think that they are doing is ‘buying” a person for some kind of donation to the church. This is pandering. And illegal.

And it seems to involve is people who come together and say that they wish to create an agency or syndicate that watches over the needs of a particular segment of society, age group, or gender, or what ever, and the problem is that they wish me to believe that I need them to do whatever it is that they so, so that they can then play what ever role they are trying to play or fulfill what ever mission they are trying to fulfill and the agents seem to be attempting to coordinate some kind of situation that I am not interested in participating in at all. They can fulfill their mission some where else, with someone else some other time but not with me. Some unfaithful husband, disobedient children, or unfaithful wife seeking a scapegoat. I am just not interested in the role of scapegoat at all. And I cold care less about their mission which is ultimately criminal any way.
And as I was saying most of or much of the criminal activity in the United States seems to come from the military establishment, or the ecclesiastical establishment, and their liaisons, much of the cimre seems to e in some way coming from these two institutions the military establishment or the ecclesiastical establishment. Military, retired military, churchmen-politicians, retired churchmen-politicians, clergymen-politicians, retired clergymen-polyticians. And so all of this crime that they are generating or simply ignoring so that they can salvage fees from it later seems to violate the Constitution in every way, not just in one way but in every way, and it seems also to violate ethics in every way to do such a thing to people.

They are obsessed with giving me a role which is maladaptive, these people are misanthropes. They wish me to hide behind a mental illness diagnosos to do unspeakable things, illegal things, unlawful things, indecent things as well, and these are church-man politicians, and clergymen-politicians, who publicly oppose all kinds of sinfulness, and wickedness and iniquity, and crime, but privately oppose righteousness.










California State Department of

Oakland, California 94612

Re: Attempt at Chattel slavery: Interference with hot water, and also with heating as a reprisal, involving espionage, fascism. Interference with water to my apartment also espionage, reprisal.

Dear California State Department of Fair Employment and Housing:

Exactly what these reprisals are all about I believe has something to do with my personal preference for (1) Temprance, (2) Celibacy, (3) Individuality and (4) Independence, which is in direct opposition to the Van Nuys Apartments AIMCO community preference for Chattel Slavery and the Drug Cartels in the Los Angeles area.

It seems to be a form of chattel slavery that is the objective and the ulterior motive of these activities. Chattel slavery, meaning that the human being is a piece of property bought and sold, particularly for illegal purposes.

I discussed the matter with one of the staff members of the District Attorney
And I made a complaint to the US Attorney Citizen Complaints at the Federal Court House, and to the Central Division Police, as well as the manager, maintenance and security of the Van Nuys Apartments where I live, and where the conspiracy is taking place 210 W. 7th Street, LA 90014.

Chattel slavery an illegal objective. It is more of a criminal matter than a Civil Matter in essence. The motives of chattel slavery are criminal. And it violates the Americans With Disabilities Act. And, if the criminal objectives involve seeking to infringe upon Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Expression or Freedom of Religion, the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause, or Voting Rights

It seems to me that these people are Drug Cartel people attempting to “disciple me” into chattel slavery. To make me one of “them” i.e. chattel.

But beyond that. The fact is that I really don’t trust these chattel slavery and Drug Cartel folks, foreign Drug Cartel or Domestic Drug Cartel folks. I don’t trust these folks at all and I don’t like the drug culture at all. They have no sense of scruples or compunctions. I think what the drug cartels do is treasonous. And so long as I believe that they are treason makers and treason perpetrators. I think that dope use is treasonous too. And these persons are depraved, Drug cartels in the Los Angeles are people with depraved hearts.
And so, then I am of the opinion that the maintenance, the security, the office personnel, and the tenants, and the “does inclusive” are people with depraved hearts, even if they are priests and nuns and sisters, and church members. Chattel slavery is depraved, and people with depraved hearts engage in it.

Chattel slavery is a most fundamental evil. Chattel slavery is a most rudimentary depravity. And if these people will go along with chattel slavery, they will go along with anything. And that includes the maintenance personnel, the security guards, and the office staff and these Korean immigrants, and rest of the people in this building and in this area. So, they can’t be trusted to do right. They don’t have any personal convictions regarding chattel slavery, and depravity. If personal conviction was there, it would be there. But they didn’t take a stand against depravity or chattel slavery today. They were perfectly willing to go right along with chattel slavery which is an abomination. They are perfectly willing to defile this nation with chattel slavery.

They never once took a stand against depravity today. They only kept trying to defend depravity. Ultimately relenting and saying that I could just sign off and say that I did not want to participate, but never coming to the conclusion, or to the realization that chattel slavery is depraved and illegal and wrong. They never came to a point of repentance to turn away from sin, turn away from chattel slavery. They never came to the point of having any compunctions or scruples.

They didn’t have any right to solicit me to participate in Chattel slavery, by using the subterfuge about the pest control. More then likely, they were trying to use me as a decoy to hide someone else’s acts of chattel slavery. They did this at the Chadwick Apartments too. I the police never came to the conclusion that chattel slavery was depraved at the Ramparts Division. And I told them that this is always criminal.

I told them that this is America for beginners.

I believe that they are intentionally and purposefully polluting the water.
Who? It is kind of like napalm, kills life, but leaves property untouched.
I believe that they are intentionally polluting the atmosphere with feumes
That cause degenerative diseases.
Who? Churhmen-politicans, Clergymen-politicians and their allies, their foreign allies and liaisons.
These are my waking reflections,
I believe that these persons have a morbidity objective.
Fascists with a morbidity objective.
I believe that they have done this before and that they have a rather kind of schedule and actuarial tables, and orders and they follow these orders to the death and that they have killed off thousands, hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions of people in this way.
I actually think that this is what they are doing. They did the same thing in 1986, 1987, 1988. I believe that this is a routine extermination and genocide operation in the United States. Yes, I do believe this. I believe that they have no compunctions and no scruples, and no conscience, and no remorse. I believe that these folks are in fact exactly doing what they set out to do and that is to depopulate the area for the income migrants from around the world here to the United States of America.

I do not believe that this Preservation Society is trying to preserve anything. I think that this is a salvage operation rather than a renovation and preservation. Just look, they replaced the fine carpet with the cheapest carpet. I believe that they are salvaging finer building materials to sell to foreign buyers, and selling the finer carpet to foreign buyers.
Do I believe that the Justice Department knows about this. Yes I do. I believe that they knew or had reason to know, or should have know about these extermination plans in the 1980’s and did nothing because of the lucrative nature of this business, and that they know now about the same salvaging, and extermination plans now and are doing nothing.
I do not believe that the justice department fights against the enemies of the people of the United States, I believe that the Justice Department fights against those most loyal to their country, those who are most patriotic towards their country the United States of America, and that the Justice Department does not fight against those whose agenda is morbidity towards the United States. I believe that the Justice Department works with those whose agenda towards the Untied States is increased morbidity towards the people of the United States, or towards a segment of the people of the United States. I believe that they have always done this. This is of course disenchanting information. I realize that. This information that would disenchant anyone, any right thinking person concerning the Untied States of America. I believe that the Justice Department opposes right. And that the Justice Department opposes right in the United States, and that the Central Intelligence Agency oppose s right all around the world. I think that the Justice Department opposes right around the world and in the United States. I believe that the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are the fosterers and facilitators of morbidity, extermination, genocides of millions of people.

I used to believe differently because I watched those Hollywood movies about the righteousness and the upstanding, sterling character of the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Treasury Agents. And I always believed that they were using might for right, and that they were the “good guys”. Now my opinion of the Justice Department is totally reversed, and totally disenchantment has replaced my beliefs in the untarnished righteousness, unblemished goodness, and unsullied morals, the unswerving ethicalness of the Justice Department, the Supreme Court whom I now believe have a morbidity intention towards millions of people, along with the church whom I now think has a morbidity intention towards millions if not tens of millions of people, or hundreds of millions of people on this world, on this earth, on this planet. I think that the so called “good guys” monsters. I am talking about really, really huge disillusionment.
I believe now that the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are only capable of sordid and vulgar and morbid
I have become disenchanted with Firemen and Paramedics. I think that they are all in this together the genocide, the extermination, the horrible ruin.
Much of this disillusionment has come from my association with the Episcopal Church, and with the Reverend Bacon, and the Reverend Regis and their movement and the Civil Rights Movement and the Human Rights Movement. I suppose you could call it, instead of “social psychology”. I suppose you could call it “moral psychology” applied to the institution of War. Is War moral at all? Is War ever moral? And my believe is that War never is and never was moral. This is not a revelation that I wanted to have. This shatters my believe in the inherent goodness of mankind. That’s gone. I think that has been gone for some time now. This is not an enlightenment that I wanted to have. This shatters my believe in many if not all of the most hallowed American institutions. But I can’t help it.
These issues keep coming up ever since the death of JFK, RFK,MLK and Marylin Monroe. Defectors within the Justice Department. Defecters within the Treasury Department. Defectors amongst the people. People whose sentiments are ever with those nations who practice morbidity.

I was thinking that they have gone all over the world lying to people, and exterminating people quietly by getting people into hospitals and poisoning the medication or failing to sterilize the equipment or doctors who were morbid. They have gone all over the world with this kind of global political extermination “machine” fascism.

They are trying to induce me to defect. They are trying to seduce me into defecting.


They do this all over the world. All around the globe they seduce people, and induce them to defect and then once the people have defected, they are exterminated, genocided, destroyed. They induce them to defect, seduce them into defecting and then destroy them for having defected. And each and every time they try to do this to me, again, since I am now I have a raised consciousness and a raised defensiveness against this morbidity, I have a fit, and globalize the situation, and blow it all out of proportion, because to me it is a serious breach of ethics, it is not a light thing to try and induce defection or to try to seduce someone to defect. It is not a light thing, it is a serious thing. Of course the arrogance of the men doing this caused them to say “Awe go ahead, bring on the DEA, bring them on in here.” Of course this was due to the fact that in their small, backward country, they have come to believe that morbidity is normal, morbidity is the only standard lifestyle, the only standard of living, chattel slavery is the normal lifestyle.
And so they are using their position to try to recruit me into defecting.

In these small countries their experience with the United States has come through the American tourists, usually White Middle Class, and through the American military.
And so they go over to these countries and behave like barbarians and freaks and then the situation inevitably returns here to America to cause confusion, because our laws forbid the very things that they require. The foundations of America are Puritan, Quaker, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Catholic, Methodist, and Baptist.

And so, these people from these small backward countries, where people are chattel.
These small, backward countries in Asia, and Middle East, and Africa, and South America, and Europe where people are chattel, for some reason attempt to defect people to that mess. There are people right here in the United States who deny their individual rights and begin to behave like chattel, right here in America.

I remember something about these people from the 1980’s. I remember them.
And they are doing exactly what I think that they are doing. And these ongoing investigations are a “business” an “institution”, a “salvage” operation to support their liaisons with foreign entities, and foreign missions while subordinating and enslaving, and making chattel of Americans. How am I supposed to see this as anything but the most despicable injustice? How am I supposed to see that as anything but the most heinous immorality harboring the most criminal of motives.

I knew it was foreign missions to the United States of America that was behind this.
But you see they steer people to innocent people who are not committing any crimes, for the purpose of plundering, and falsely accusing. They keep the crooks doing what they are doing, it is a political machine. They have over two million chattel in American Prisons, two million people who are chattel, and this is a conservative number.
They have other people who are in jail in the United States who are chattel. They have other people living on the streets who are chattel. They have other people whom they are trying to make into chattel, people like me. And so, this is an inevitable reason why I gravitate to Civil Rights and Human Rights because of the churchmen-politicians and the clergymen-politicians and their unpredictable business liaisons and romantic liaisons with foreign missions. And these liaisons they use to try to turn me into chattel. I can’t let that happen. And that is the very reason that I do the nuclear holocaust chanting. I told them yesterday that they had earned, by their attempts to socialize me to chattel slavery, a nuclear holocaust chant. These people are simply “stuck on romantic stupid.”


Waking reflections,

And so, the masses, as for the masses, they want to see us dead. That is their daily prayer.
That is their daily supplication. That is their daily wish. I mean to tell you. I never thought like this, nor did I ever perceive that there were people who had these kinds of thoughts, but having become aware of the “faith” that is different from my Christian faith. I must say that this is what they are doing reversing our prayers from light to darkness. In order to disestablish Christianity and disestablish Judeo-Christianity.
They want to see all Christians dead, their prayer is for the death of all Christians, men women and children, their daily supplication is for the death of all Christian men, women and children. Isn’t that positively sick and twisted. They twist all our prayers, and they twist all of their prayers and supplications. That is right.
Their daily prayer is for death. Their daily prayer is for a happy death. Their daily prayer is for the grave and an early one at that. I don’t share their wish for this at all.
But their prayer is for a grave for us and for them. They want to see us dead, they want to see themselves dead as well. Isn’t that just awful. That want every bite that we eat to be poison even if it is not poison at all, they want our body to react to everything that we eat and all medicine that we take as if it were poison and death to be the result. Yes, that is the kind of praying that these “praying Indians” do and these “some of these other praying folk. I always thought people prayed good prayers. I never thought of prayer as having an evil or deleterious purpose, or degenerate purpose, of prayer as having a reprobate purpose, or a destructive purpose. In ever in my life until I encountered these horrible people thought of prayer as having the purpose or deteriorating health, I always prayed for healing and for heal, and for betterment. I never prayed in my life for anyone’s death, nor for my own death nor for anyone else’s death. But some of these immigrants, and some of these people with in some of these religious think that it is perfectly normal to pray for death, and to pray for the death of other people and for themselves. I pray that god will spare people. And so the use of sex magic. I recall the revelation that the four keys to the kingdom, which kingdom? The kingdom of hell are love of money, love of power, love or dope and drugs and sex, decadence, and lewdness and lechery. And this is what I believe are the keys to the Kingdom of Hell and that is what these people pray for daily more of this entirely awful and horrible morbid situations.
And so they pray for that grave, they pray for the feet of the righteous, and the self righteous to be slipping and tumbling down the stairs. And they pray for that car accident to kill them, and they pray for that, banana peal so that we will slip and fall into an early grave. They pray that all of the water that we drink will be poison. They pray that all of the medicine that we take will be poison. They pray that we will shrivle up and die a painful, a horrible, and a lurid death for and an early death and an untimely death and an accidental death that will make them rich. They pray for these things, they do not think that it is illegal to pray these kinds of prayers.
And so here they are in control of the food supply.
Here they are in control of the water supply.
Here they are in control of the air supply.
Here they are in control of the necessities of life.
And how did this happen? Hmmmm? Can anyone tell me how the foreign missions got into control of our water supply so as to put arsenic in it?
Can anyone tell me how the foreign missions got into control of our food supply so as to poison everything that we eat?
Can anyone tell me how the foreign missions got into control of the preparing food in the restraints, greasy spoons, and beaneries, the coffee houses, the mall food courts, the food in the canning and bottling factories?
Can anyone tell me how the foreign missions got control of our air supply to poison that?
Can anyone tell me how the foreign missions got control of our pharmeceutal company manufacturing plants?
Liaisons.
And so, these persons have the mind set of insects. These people that I am speaking of here who pray for the untimely deaths of people, or pray for the deaths of people.
These people have the mind set of insects, like bees or something. They see life as a be hive with drones, and worker bees and a queen bee. Darwin at least gave humans credit for being human, these people see humans as having nothing more than the instincts of insects. Something like spiders who sting and cacoon their prey for later consumption. Or like the prying mantis female who bites off the head of the male after mating. And so, these people are reducing mankind, humans even below the level of chattel slavery, to the level of insects. And all this to escape their responsibility and obligation to God the Father, God The Son, God the Holy Ghost. And to say that humans have no more responsibility for their actions than insects or animals do. They don’t hold insects responsible for what they do, and so why hold humans responsible for what they do.
They don’t hold animals responsible for what they do, so why hold humans responsible for what they do? And so, this seems to be what is going on with these people in the church, and out of the church, and globally, and world wide.

And when did this start? Probably with the “praying Indians” and probably in the early days of colonial America and it continues to this day. And that seems to be what these ongoing investigations are all about, they generate fees, they generate a repetition of fees, these ongoing investigations, for years, and years by federal law enforcement is like this kind of bee hive situation where it creates an institution where evil and wrongdoing is protected, and evil and wrongdoing is protected, and righteousness is subordinated, and they want no righteousness, but they want unrighteousness to continue because it is fee generating, and they replicate the same crime, and the same corruption and continue to replicate the same crime and the same corruption, and they pray for the death of those who would disestablish this kind of bee hive operation, and so they sting the righteous people, who will not defect into this quagmire, this cesspool, of international crime, and global c rime and worldwide crime. And so, their daily prayer is that immorality will prevail. And this seems to have something to do with the liaisons between these people.
And so they put poisoned over-the-counter medications on the shelves when Social Security Checks Come out so that people on welfare will buy these things and die.
They add poison to the food on in the supermarket and in the restaurants and cafeterias so that the people who only eat out once a month will eat this food and die of it. This is the Justice Department, both the state Justice Department and the Federal Justice Department. This is what they are doing. I am opposed to this kind of Fascism to any kind of Fascism for that matter. The Ivy league schools, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Rutgers they all seem to have their foundation in this kind of liaison with morbidity.
And so, they poison the “food chain”. Poison the grass that the cows eat and so the milk will be poisoned too. Or they poison the food that you give to people to take home and they eat it and die. But the purpose of putting poison in something is that who ever drinks it or eats it dies and nothing else. I noticed that somebody vandalized my third set of Christmas lights. These are inside my apartment.

I told them that they were lying yesterday and today is not different. They are still lying.
These people not only have no compunctions about lying, they have no compunctions about stealing or vandalizing either. I remember them from the 80’s when they tried to get me to become part of their “off campus”, frat house, or sorority house “praying Indians” chattel slaves.

You see they don’t go over seas to spread the gospel as much as they go over there to learn what the backward people do in their primitive religious animism, their spells, their potions, their treatments, their herbs, their medicines, their punishments, their tortures, their darkness. They don’t go over there to discover how to be good or to teach the people to be good, they go over there to find out how they get power over people, and how to come back to the United States and trek back to the United States with these people, and set them up and stealthily, and covertly experiment and research and see how they can investigate and generate fees, and generate revenues by having them use these kinds of tactics on Americans here. This is the Justice Department and the State Department too doing this. The Department of Defense too.

10:34 a.m. January 1, 2009

Reflections, Contemplations, Revelations,
Inspirations, Grudges, Mysteries

I noticed last night that a set of my multi-colored Christmas lights had been vandalized.
As I plugged them up I noticed that one of the three sets did not light up. I knew that this was a vandalization. They did this also at LAMP Lodge, these “praying Indians”. I put my Christmas decorations up and they gradually vandalized every set of Christmas lights, even if I replaced them, these people, these dastardly evil people, vandalized the Christmas lights. And so, then my first act of insurrection was to go to the Central Division Police Station and report the vandalization. And also to report that the the criminals when I confronted them about their criminal conspiracy to involve me, against my will in Chattel slavery, and I threatened them with notification to the DEA and the Federal Protecitve Services, they were unmoved by this threat, and unperturbed by the possibility that the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Federal Protective Services would find out, would know of their activities and eventually put a stop to their illegal conspiracies and corru ption, arrest them, try them and incarcerate them. They were totally unperturbed with this possible consequences, and they said “bring it on.”. And so, I did starting the first thing this morning. I gave them Christmas cookies out of the kindness and generosity of my heart, not because I am enslaved or chattel. Upset that they could not have all of the cookies, or any more cookies they stole the plate on which the cookies were placed, and vandalized my Christmas lights to boot. And so, this morning my first act of insurrection was to discuss this grudge with the Los Angeles Police Department. The grudge having to do with my rejection of chattel slavery and their acceptance and acquiescence of chattel slavery.

And so this is the first day of 2009, the first day of the insurrection against chattel slavery in the United States. And I must add something more to this entry. It is the Redman, the Yellowman, the Blackman, the Brownman and the Whiteman that are all involved in this chattel slavery. It is my duty to revolt against Chattel slavery because it is illegal.
Now the DEA will tolerate Chattel slavery. They have said so. The Federal Protective Services will tolerate chattel slavery. They have said so too. The Sheriff’s Department will tolerate chattel slavery because it is good business, fee generating, revenue generating and gives them in good stead with foreign protocols, and foreign dignitaries, and foreign visitors to the United States. The police department will tolerate chattel slavery because they are under orders, and they cannot act without orders. The church will tolerate chattel slavery because the church has no commitment to freedom, liberty, justice, or equality, or holiness. And so, I do confess that I have a personal vendetta regarding chattel slavery, and that is the frank, honest, candid truth of the matter. I have a personal vendetta, and personal grudge against the institution of chattel slavery, not against individuals per say but against chattel slavery as an institution, as an industry, as an organized pur poseful means of extermination and genocide. The church on the other hand, has a different out look “if it makes money, do it”. That seems to be the outlook of the Catholic Church on slavery, and the protestants as well seem to adhere to this dastardly motto, “If it makes money, do it.” And so chattel slavery is not on their list of things to disassemble, or disestablish, or distain, or despise, or detest. Chattel slavery is not on the Catholic Church’s “black list”. Chattel slavery is a big money maker. This is what happens, they make their money off of the chattel slavery, and then turn around and out law it, and ban it, and wipe out every body that they used in that particular venture, but for the few survivors. In fact Chattel slavery is popular in Catholic Countries and in Catholic institutions seem to have chattel slavery as an elemental and rudimentary element of their existence. And so the issues of chattel slavery. In Asian countr ies, and South American Countries and European Countries, and Middle Eastern Countries and African Countries chattel slavery is popular and Catholic Church embraces chattel slavery. And that is the reason for my insurrection, I do not wish to be “embraced” by chattel slavery at all, ever. Yes I do have a personal grudge and vendetta regarding the institution of chattel slavery, they took and put my children into that it, and me for a time. I hate chattel slavery now. I hated chattel slavery then. And so I am starting off the new year 2009 with insurrection, lest the chattel slavery people here in America forget that a minority opinion is still important, and the person holding the minority opinion still has a right to dissent. My opinion regarding chattel slavery is an unpopular opinion. Notwithstanding the overwhelming support in the United States of America of chattel slavery, I hate it because there is an inherent degradation of the value of human life, and disrega rd for the value of human life a callousness with regard to the value of human life. There is devaluing of the value and preciousness of human life inherent in chattel slavery in the United States of America, even thought they say the opposite is true. The institution of Chattel Slavery can’t be destroyed. It is like that film, Crimson Tide where the officers are sitting in captain’s chambers and they are discussing War and Denzel Washington’s character says that the real enemy can’t be destroyed, the real enemy is “War itself” And that is how I feel about the institution of Chattel Slavery, they it cannot be destroyed, that Chattel Slavery is the real enemy, and that enemy cannot be destroyed because it is an institution. But there can be insurrection against Chattel Slavery, there can be revolt against Chattel slavery, there can be resistance against Chattel Slavery,
And there can be constant and relentless conspiracy, and collaboration against Chattel Slavery. I think that Chattel Slavery is the institution that the English were trying to impose on Scotland during the life time of William Wallace. That the Scotts were just dirt under the feet of the English. And so, it all boils down to the idea that it is the protestant church that seems to be involved in trying to impose chattel slavery, by deceit, guile, stealth, menace, coercion, duress, trespassing, oppression, lechery. And their use of the “praying Indians” which could be called “Nationals” to try to impose chattel slavery. And then after themselves imposing this chattel slavery seeking to destroy us for having been imposed upon against our will illegally. And so this act of insurrection today against illegal chattel slavery in the United States of America under the Redman, the Yellowman, the Brownman the Blackman and the Whiteman is not new, and it should be no surprise that a person takes as part of their religious views the abolition, the disassembly, the disinfranchisment of chattel slavery, the dissolution of chattel slavery, the disestablishment of chattel slavery as did William Wallace in his day opposed the same tyranny. Hundreds of years later the same tyranny.

Re: I contend that the mysterious behaviors of the people here at the Van Nuys Apartments have something to do with acting as “middle men”, possibly in
A criminal syndicate which involves a myriad of felonious activities, including but not limited to fraud and possibly violations of the statute of frauds in some way.

They have been trying to disciple me. And I am unwilling to be discipled at all by these people. They really are disgusting. Truly disgusting.


I made objections today because apparently these people wish to recruit me, induct me, include me in their plans which would infringe upon my rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act specifically Independent Living.

Apparently the crew of maintenance persons, the office staff, and some if not all of the security personnel, and some if not all of the tenants are involved in some kind of
Conspiracy, of party of conspirators. I don’t wish to participate at all. And, it seems that the induction and recruit methods or “discipeling methods are scurrilous. I believe that these people are unscrupulous, scurrilous and nafarious.

The scenario today involved a felonious attempt to schedule an entry into my apartment for “pest” control. My apartment has no pests whatsoever. I told them that the this is a “lie” that they are lying. And I continue to believe that they are lying in such a manner as to commit a fraud of some kind.

I told them today that I believed that situation has everything to do with the rampant drug, narcotics, and dope and marijuana habits of the people the work, and live in the area and in this building. And, I made it very clear that I am just not interested in being part of their need to support their dope trafficking, or dope habits, or dope distributions, or dope use, of what ever they are doing.

I visited the Central Division Police Station at 6th and Maple Street to renounce this conspiracy entirely. I don’t want them including me in any of their dope socializations, and I don’t care how many stars, celeberties, or politicians do this. I visited the US Attorney and made a written complaint. I visited the District Attorney and made a verbal complaint. I don’t want their invitations into fraud and crime and corruption. And these various maintenance issues are in fact and in actuality a parallel to illegal, but very popular despite illegality, activitivies which believe have something to do with recreational drugs.

The Maintenance, and office personnel are worried about offending the drug Cartel. The dope users, the dope peddlers, the dope distributors, the dope growers in the film and entertainment industry that is widespread in the downtown area. They are worried about offending the dope industry. That is my personal assessment. They are not worried about the unlawfulness of their stealthy solicitations. I is just appalling and abominable, and detestable they way they just go along with anything and everything. The roots of this mess seem to be Anglo-Saxon culturally speaking, notwithstanding that none of our maintenance people are of Anglo-Saxon descent, and none of our office personnel is of Anglo-Saxon descent.

This afternoon I visited the Fairfax District. I was followed of course. The bus that I was riding was followed by people in their cars. Just plain ridiculous obsession. I got off of the Rapid Wilshire and walked up Fairfax to the Jewish District. I saw people that I have known for many years in fact all my life. And it was a happy reunion. I visited for about forty five minutes. But I noticed that the people who had been following me did not follow me into the Jewish District actually. Two people asked me where LACMA was located, I pointed them in the right direction.

What these people seem to do is follow me around recruiting people to do evil or criminal behaviors. If they are not Central Intelligence Agency themselves, they are operatives of the Central Intelligence Agency misanthropes. And so I am convinced as of today that this Preservation and Rennovation has nothing to do with historical preservation and everything to do with some kind of “ongoing investigation, in which the perpetrators try to recruit people into the vortex of criminal behavior and activity, illicit chattel slavery, drug addiction, and all kinds or horridly evil and wicked behaviors by deceit, spying subterfuge, guile, entrapment. I believe that is what is going on here and I believe that it is some kind of “appeasement”, something to make foreign consumers happy. As long as they feel that Americans are being deprived in some way, or given drug tests, or being investigated this makes the foreign consumers happy. They want to see Americans squabbling, a nd competing over the crumbs that they choose to drop along the way, those foreign consumers, and foreign entities. They seem to be under the impression that I would make a wonderful addition to their little twisted, criminal agenda. But No thanks. I am absolutely not interested.

I spoke with the FBI today and their position is that people should just simply not mind being put into slavery, bondage or enslavement, apathetic, apathy. They didn’t say that, but it seems that they are quite used to watching this kind of scenario take place passively.

And so, the first agent that I spoke with decided that my complaint was a threat, my know what was going on was a threat and he wanted to muzzle my beak so that the criminal activity might continue unhindered. Criminal activity unhindered by the FBI. Does that make sense? No it doesn’t make sense to me. I always thought that they FBI existed to hinder criminal activity. But apparently I assumed wrongly. The FBI does not exist to hinder criminal activity. The FBI exists instead to foster criminal activity. The same seems to be true of the DEA. Criminal activity unhindered by the DEA. I always assumed that the DEA existed to hinder criminal activity. However apparently, again my information was not correct. The DEA exists to let criminal activity continue unhindered so that they can catch the more important criminals, even though people like me, innocent persons, innocent bystanders, might be subjugated to chattel slavery by these criminals. In fact they use us as bait and scapegoats. And so here we have an enigma, a puzzle, and a mystery i.e. law enforcement agencies and law enforcement organizations and detective agencies, and legal intelligence agencies that attempt to hinder the protection of innocent people, and of innocent bystanders, or even to expose innocent people or innocent bystanders to peril, capture, danger, and enslavement, purposefully. Who lie, and deceive and trick, and engage in subterfuge, and guile. Who make money off of the bad guys and so they don’t want the bad guys to be interdicted or caught, or captured or stopped from doing the crime and the harm that they are doing. And so, they expose innocent people to danger, and innocent bystanders to capture, while at the same time shielding the bad guys, and evil doers, the enemy and keeping their criminal businesses, their criminal commerce unhindered so that they too can make money from the criminal operations, but in the end attempting to wipe out all traces of these person s on whom they have made their money, and used in these ongoing investigations. There is something, as a matter of conscience, that is inherently not right about this kind of behavior. It seems to lack any sense of scruples, it seems to be nefarious, it seems to be fraudulent and felonious and it seems entirely unspeakable for law enforcement, federal or global, or international to do such things. It is unspeakably monstrous. And that is the reason that I am making these self-exorcisms and complaints regarding this. And so, here come these people trying to induct me, and the FBI or agents saying, “O sure, she doesn’t mine” when in fact I do mind. I mind a great deal and they can’t speak for me. I have noticed that at the Cathedral, open my mouth to say something and some guy speaks up and tries to over talk me as if I am not permitted to have a voice, or have any understanding. And so it seems to me that in their minds they have a ‘relationship&#821; 7; that does not exist specifically an attachment to me that is a fiction, possibly based upon gender, or some other social criteria.

And so we have this kind of vortex, or vacuum with regard to the rights of particular individuals, or with regard to the rights of particular sects, or segments of society, where in these agents fictionalize a level of consciousness wherein certain people are only in existence to be exploited by certain other people. And some of this is propagated by clergymen-politicians, or churchmen-politicians this kind of pride and prejudice. The quagmire seems to include their claim to “rights” over the person, and their work product, and their claim to “rights” over the person and their time, and talent, and treasure. Rights that clash with the individuals Civil Rights and Human Rights. They seem to wish to be the master of the person, like someone is the master of their family dog, or family pet, trying to keep the person on a leash, or some how keep the person “hobbled” like they do a horse, or put a bit in a the horses mouth to turn the person by some k ind of bridle. The whole thing seems very totalitarian to me. I don’t like it. I won’t tolerate it. It is two things that are counter to democracy, 1. Totalitarianism and 2. Fascism. And that is what these ongoing investigations are about. And so, my prayers are for the disestablishment of totalitarianism, and my prayers are for the disestablishment of fascism. And what they have done is recruited people and formed a kind of pyramid scheme, a social pyramid, also an economic pyramid, an emotional pyramid. And so, there is the problem of nepotism, and favoritism, and interdependency, and co dependency, and dependency.
America for beginners. Fascism cannot stand. Totalitarianism cannot stand. Chattel slavery cannot stand. Every time. The natives who were being held in chattel slavery by the religious missions eventually revolted against their “chains”, whether these chains were political, or emotional, or social and refused to be chattel anymore. Well, their oppressors, and suppressors moved on and tried to find people who were less resistant.
I am speaking of the Unification Church and their oppressive campaign in the United States.

4:59: A.M

I was thinking this morning that the instructor may not allow me to remain in the class.
Although he did refer to “sinners” yesterday, and to the crucifixion briefly in passing, there may be apprehension that the class will focus on Christianity or Judaism. He may be advised to drop me from the class by “the sinister someone else.

He may follow the same pattern as the St. John’s Episcopal Church did about the EMJ class and exclude me.

Possibly and foremost because I will not submit to a rape.
Apparently submitting to a rape is a sign of submission, submissiveness, and subordination. And that is absolutely right. I am not ever going to submit to a rape of myself, not ever again. A rape is a tragedy, not a birthday celebration.

Self Identity

Editing the textbook

“In many ways telling stories is one of our primary means for expressing our common ancestry.”

“All forms of stories, whether folk tales, literary fiction, autobiography, history or myths, are ways of expressing cultural and social meaning.”

“because stories are so important to our connections with our shared past of common ancestry, one of the persistant and important themes that runs through all of these selections is that of memory or histories.”

“Histories are stories that play important rules in our lives. And although we often talk about telling the difference between a true story and a false one, histories are a kind of story where the line between truth and fiction is not always easy to distinghish.”

“Just as it is difficult to tell the difference between truth and fiction in regard to the past,it is also the case that our everyday world is structured by all kinds of “fictions” that give certain meaning and shape to what we believe.”

“In fact discovery is the key theme of all these selections.”

“but it is often not easy because it often seems as though there is more than one self to be discovered.”

Q. Why am I here?
A. Discovery
Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
“How do we put our many selves together into a single self?”

“What lies, fiction, and stories do we tell ourselves (and others) that help to knit together the various pieces of our lives that are shaped, or misshapen by the roles we play, by the experiences we have, by the identities we are led to construct to survive and each new situation, or experience?”

“Another facet of self-identity is crucial here: the connection between who we think we are and the people around us think we are, with whom we live, work, dispute, associate, agree, and disagree, make covenants, make rules, make laws, make pacts.”

“To what extent is each of us our own self as well as a reflection of someone else?”

“How fluid is our own identity as shaped or misshapen by people around us as well as shaping or misshaping others.?”

“How much is each of us an individual as well as a part of some collective identity with others in our shared contexts i.e. family, community, city, county, state, parish, work place, groups, memberships, unions, associations, leagues, parties, cyber groups, etc.”

“In most western cultures, and especially in the United States, we are accustomed to think in terms of “individuality” as a critical concept of our identity.”

“But in many ways, the idea of an autonomous, self-centered individual is a “fiction” of our culture.”

“That is, “self-identity and a sense of individuality is a fiction, a story that we tell ourselves to feel whole in the context of two shaping, or misshaping tendencies of our multiple selves.”

“The fragmentation of the self into multiple roles and the fluidity of the self with those around us”?

“But for many of the writers in this book, feeling whole is problematic, feeling fragment is also problematic, in part because there is a conflict among the multiple sources of identity.”

“Our attempts to define ourselves inherently involves knowing our ancestry, and our past,
and our common shared ancestry.”

“In many cases defining others means viewing them as the opposites of ourselves or an antithesis of ourselves, and all that we hold dear and love, and cherish, and respect, or prize, or honor.” As everything we hate, despise, detest, deplore, distain, loathe, scorn, and hold in contempt, hatred, and abhorrence.

“Although people can feel this in very personal terms, in a larger sense individuals construct a sense of self-based in part on the message they receive from their culture, or from another culture, or from a dominant culture, of from a sub culture.”

“So this chapter is also very much concerned with some of the ways that the idea of otherness gets depicted in American culture, both in explicit and implicit ways, in both subtle, stealthy, and covert ways, and obvious ways.

The class seems to already have a social hierarchy, a pecking order.
Possibly because of participation in fraternities, or sororities and these are possibly
Based on gender, male or female, biologically biased pecking order.
Tribe
Or possibly from a study of animal behavior behaviors are contemplated.
Such as wolf packs behaviors.
Or such as lion pride behaviors.
Possibly some of these persons were members of the Boy Scouts of America or the Girl Scouts of America which rely on some of the social formats of Native American culture.
And so the tendency is to attempt to apply or impose these view on those who are non-participants, to attempt to impose this “social order” on those who are non-participants against their will, subtly, implicitly as some kind of “natural order”. Even if the persons don’t believe or accept that there is such a thing as a “natural order” and reject the idea of a belief in a “natural order.”

I think President Abraham Linclon had something to say about this in his Gettysburg Address which I will not repeat here.

My first visit this morning was to Los Angeles City College,
To attend the Humanities 6 class at 8:00 a.m.-10:35 a.m.

We had homework. Began reading Chapter 1
We did questions in class 10 questions and turned those in.
We worked on Self Identity Questions.
We had class discussion.
We read the story of The Hopi Boy and the Sun
Anonymous

This was a story about a boy who was being transformed into a priest.
It was a sacred scripture from the Hopi culture, and it also was a mystical
Story, a spiritual story which contained metaphors. The journey was full of symbolisms and metaphors. The cultures mentioned were Navaho, Apachi, Hopi, Zuni and Mexican.
The distinctions between the cultures were depicted in Animal characters such as , blue birds, and other substances such as much, and straw wheat. The boy was learning by example, experience and demonstration what he was to do, who his father was and what he was to be. His father was the sun a metaphor for god, similar in position to Akahaton in Egyptian culture greatly similar in power, prestiege, and dignity. “As above, so below”. The boy was exactly like his father, he was bathed and vested in an outfit exactly like his father was wearing. He encountered cultures who helped him, and assisted him on his Holy Quest, holy journey, holy mission. He met a snake girl, and all of her relatives who was his companion. They traveled on a river which was a symbol of baptism and birth, symbolic of the birth canal, and new birth and new live. They arrived at the ocean. The elements that they encountered, and met were able to speak and talk, they were mystical, and spiritual entities and beings.
The boy related to some of the cultures who were doing harm in the same manner as the Israelites related to those other tribes who were their enemies. And, represented them as inferior, or themselves as inferior if their enemies were superior. At one point, the Israelite spies brought back an evil report to Joshusa, saying, that “we are as grasshoppers and they are giants, we cannot go in and take the land.” The boy related to the inferior tribes by killing them, just like the Israelites related to the other nations by killing them and wiping them out.

The boy returned to his village with power, and status, and dignity and importance. But he was not ashamed of his humble beginning, and when recognized by the Chief, and told not to go back to that dirty house, he said that it was his home, but they could clean the house if they liked, which they did.

And so, that was the end.

The same group of girls met together in class today.
A group of all Armenian girls.

Suzie, Suzie, Ida, Ann and I don’t recall the name of the other Armenian student who is in my group.

I briefly spoke with my teacher this morning about whether or not he was going to permit me to stay in the class, I told him about my experience at St. John’s, and the Church of Scientology, and Self-Realization, that these three organizations had simply dismissed me from the class or correspondence without any explanation whatsoever, or a very implausible excuse that made no sense at all to me. He advised me to talk to him about my experience in the class and participate in class. I did my best to do that today. It became easier as I went along to participate in class.

Let Us Pray.

O God Come to my assistance.
O Lord Make haste to help me.

O Lord hear my prayer,
And let my cry come unto Thee.

Impressions, Intuitions, Mysteries,


I recall that I had to deal with a situation of White Back Lash in 1966-1968 when I went to East Los Angeles City College in Monterey Park, California. This situation today is exactly the same as that situation was them.
I thought that racism had taken a hit since the 1960's but it appears that I was mistaken about that. Racism and all of its aspects is alive and well in America. My major was Music. I was in the Music Department, my teachers were Mr. Truitt Hollis, and Mr. Fisher.

I received some interesting news concerning this back lash today from Lilli at the Third Church of Christ Scientists on Hope Street in Los Angeles. Lilli tells me that Mr. Alverson, Mr. Michael Alverson who used to work at the Third Church of Christ Scientist has died. He was on a four week vacation. He did not have a wive, but he had three children. He was in his middle fifties. I believe that this was back lash. Mr. Alverson was a very nice man and an associate of mine. I visited him occasionally at the reading room and bought books from them. This was definately back lash.

I arrived back at the Van Nuys Apartments to day and discovered that my suit case which I place behind my door had been moved for the second day in a row. I put the suit case back and left to go to Ralphs. I returned and the suitcase had been moved again. More back lash, more interference with property.

I arrived at school this morning on time and sat in my usual seat. The students came in and the class began. We did some interesting exercises, and then made a circle for class discussion. The Backlash came out during the class discussion. The White back lash came out during the circle discussion and during somme of the exercises. We are reading from Beyond Borders a Cultural Reader.

And I was thinking today as I was walking along to Ralphs that I have to write an essey about self Identity that is our next assignment due on monday. I am in a group Suzy, Suzie, Anna, Ida, and Danielle. Danielle just came into the class today. The idea that there is something sinister going on was my impresison because I have someone in my family named Daniell also, and I figure that this has something to do with that. Also I noticed backlash among the other students as well.
The first exercise was to ask questions in the style of the Church of Scientology processing where you ask the same question repeatedly and get and answere repeatedly. Then you switch partners. A and B.

The second exercise was to have four people get to gather and read their answers about each person.

The Third exercise was a human knot. We held hands and made a big circle and then wound ourselves into a knot by going around in and out and under each others arms and then there were people who came in and unwound us.

The fourth exercise was to have people stand accross and stare each other in the eyes without smiling or laughing or speaking. Some people were very well practiced at this kind of staring down.
And so this was all about White Back Lash today. How to get back at the United States for electing a Black Man as President.

I am going to start my paper like this.

I am 61 years old and there have been many things that have shaped my identity, but most of all it has been the holocausts of live that have shaped my identity. And then I will go on to describe all of the holocausts. I also will deal with history , and the fact that many of the things that have shaped my life, no longer exist, such as the Helms Bakery Truck, and the Good Humor Ice Cream Truck, and the Carnation Milk Truck, and the old neighborhood. These either outlived their usefulness, or they became obsolete. And so that is how I plan to begin my paper with this introduction so far.

We had lots of White Backlash today over the migrant and immigrant issues.
We had lots of White backlash today over the Japanese issues.
We had lost of White backlash today in class over other issues, but coming up is the
