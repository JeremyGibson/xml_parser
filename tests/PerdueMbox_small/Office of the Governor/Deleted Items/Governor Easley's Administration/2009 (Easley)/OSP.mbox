Dear Ms. Dodd,



Governor Easley shared your email with me and asked that I reply.



At the current time, state government is not under a statewide hiring freeze. However, based on the business needs of the agency, individual agencies may decide to initiate a hiring freeze.  Currently, due to fiscal constraints and a predicted budget shortfall, some state agencies have made the decision to put such a freeze in place.



If you would like additional information, please contact the agency of interest.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan
