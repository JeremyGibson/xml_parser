Subject: Ill Child's Christmas wish





Damien Hammonds, a 7-year-old boy battling neuroblastoma, a terminal cancer that attacked his entire skeletal system, lives in Rep. Sutton's  district and Damien's  wish is to receive cards through the mail. Rep. Sutton would greatly appreciate it if you would send a note and/or card and picture  to Damien. This appears to be a life ending illness.

You can mail correspondence to:

Damien Hammonds
409 Burns Rd.
Lumberton, NC 28358

Thank you,
Jo Bobbitt

Dear Ms. Reaves:

Your recent e-mail to Governor Easley has been received.  We are responding
on his behalf.  We are sorry for your loss of Blue.

The Governor does not have any authority over local police departments.
Concerns about the way the Durham Police have handled an issue should be
shared with the district attorney or your representatives on the Durham City
Counsel.  Additionally, by law Wachovia is prohibited from releasing tapes
unless they have been given the authority by court order (subpoena) to do
so.

We are sorry that we cannot be of assistance to you.

Office of the Governor
