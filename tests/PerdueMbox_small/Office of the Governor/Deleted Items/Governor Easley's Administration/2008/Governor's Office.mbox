I believe that going to this glorification of Barack Obama's election into office will benefit me in my future for a couple of reasons. One, is because it can benefit me as an inspiration if i attend a law college, which is probably going to be one of my majors. Another is that it could possibly bring my family closer together by seeing this jocund event in person. In closing, I want to say thank you for reading this and hope that you will allow me to attend.

(For the Honoray Governor Bev Perdue)
I work for the health care system, assisting disabled adults with everyday living. I do appreciate my job, but I have concerns. I get paid for most weekdays, and get holidays and weekends off. But, my client still needs care on these days. On my non-paid days, I use my own resources to make sure my client is cared for. With all due respect, I am requesting for myself and others like me to be paid for all the days that we do work for our clients.

Thanks for your time.

Carmenita Few
