This matter was referred to DCC and as you might gather from Ms. Walker's 12/24/08 correspondence (e-mail) to the office, she was not pleased but matter is closed.

Thanks,

Dear Governor Easley,I have attached a letter in word format for you to read since it is rather long. I know that it will be someone in your office, rather than you personally, because that is how it usually works. I'm ok with that as long as someone will actually acknowledge me and try to help me. Thank you so much for your time. I will also call to make sure this was received.

Happy Holidays.
