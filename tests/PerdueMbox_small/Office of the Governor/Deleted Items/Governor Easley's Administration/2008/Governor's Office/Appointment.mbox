Dear Beverly,

We are North Carolina Falun Dafa Association. We will host the Divine
Performing Arts show (DPA) in North Carolina. This performance will take
place at 7:00 pm on December 28, 2008 in the new Durham Performing Arts
Center. This show is part of the Divine Performing Arts 2009 world tour.
Last year, the show delighted over 600,000 audience in over 60 cities
worldwide. Since 2006, this show has been performed in some of the greatest
venues, including New York City's Radio City Music Hall and San Francisco's
Opera House. You may find more information about DPA show in Durham at the
link http://www.divineshows.com/rtp. We greatly appreciate the
congratulatory letter from the Governor Easley's office for this special
event. We would like to request a brief meeting with Governor Easley. We
want to thank him personally for the letter. Also, we would like to write an
article to the local Chinese newspaper Epoch Times for this event . We would
like to take a picture with Governor Easley. It is greatly appreciated if
you would schedule a 5-minute meeting with Governor Easley. Thank you so
much for your help.

Yours truly,

Kathy Li
