Dear Mr. Cansler:

I am writing to make sure that you received my emails on this subject yesterday.  As I said my complaint is very true and can be verified by documentation, recorded phone calls, and witness statements.

I have been trying to get this issue dealt with for a long time, with no results from Mr. Benton or Mrs. Odem who completely ignored me.  I read in the paper that the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is "troubled", well you do not fix the problem by ignoring valid complaints.

Sir, my husband and I did everything that WCDSS ever asked us to do, and in turn they lied about us, persecuted us for things they told us to do, forged and falsified documents, unfortunately, we made them angry because we were not willing to sit back and watch them break the law and endanger the lives of children.  The Detective who arrested Allison Baker has seen our complete file, and even he is at a loss as to how they substantiated against us.  If you want you may contact him and I am sure he will share his thoughts with you on this matter.  His name is Detective Chris Handy and he works at the Wilkesboro Police Department.

The substantiation against us should have never occurred and if there is even one doubt in your mind about unethical behavior committed by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services in regards to our case, then the substantiation should be removed and our name cleared.  I believe I have given you enough evidence to lead you to that conclusion, but if you need more, I have it. 

I am sure you will be contacting the Wilkes County Director about my complaint and I am sure that he will tell you that they had valid reasons for the substantiation, but I will tell you that his statements are not the truth and of course he is going to say that, he will not admit what they did.  If you read the documentation that I have sent you, you will see that we had a very low score and it would have been lower still if they had not of fabricated a In Home Services Agreement that never existed for us to fail to follow. 

We never should have been investigated in the first place and even that investigation proves the point.  They received the malicious report on us in August, but did not begin investigating it until October 25, 2006...that right there shows a clear violation of statutory law.

We need closure on this issue, we are requesting justice for the wrongs that have been committed against us by WCDSS.  I have been threatened by them, accused of killing my step daughters mother all because I continue to speak out about this issue.  It is a simple enough matter for you to fix.  View the evidence I have sent you, see what I am talking about, it should leave no doubt in your mind that we were wrongly substantiated against.

Do the right thing and clear our names.

I will again send both emails so that you receive all of the documentation again.  I know that it is a lot, but the only way to relate the story is by sending the entire story. 

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

> Dear Mr. Cansler:

It is my understanding that you are the new Director of The North Carolina Department and Health and Human Services.  I sincerely hope you are a better director then Mr. Benton, who I have contacted on several occasions with documented proof of forged documents, Statutory Law violations, welfare policy violations committed against us by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, only to never receive any kind of a response from him.

I know that you are new and I am sure that some of the people in your office will tell you that what I am saying isn't the truth, but I can assure you it is and some of your employees helped cover it up.

I am asking you to view the documents that I have sent you, I suggest starting with the revised complaint against WCDSS, then view the forged signature and the actual signature on the safety assessments done by Allison Baker, who has by the way, been arrested and is awaiting trial for Felony Obstruction of Justice in regards to our case.

I have had to send all of this documentation in two installments, I ask that you read all of them, at the bottom of the second email is a description of all the documents attached, read them all, contact and speak with me because I also have recorded phone conversations that verify my complaint.   Then I ask that you conduct a full investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of not only our case, but of several others I can tell you about.

What I want: I would like the substantiation removed from me and my husband, David R. Nixon as well as Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce, because it is my belief we were substantiated against to discredit our complaints against them.  We did not do anything that even remotely resembled child abuse of neglect.  The reason they said they substantiated against us was due to parents inability to get along, we did everything in our power to get along with Mrs. Groce and I can prove this by recorded telephone conversations and video of the pick up and drop offs. 

Furthermore, their claim does not fit statutory guidelines for neglect and if parents inability to get along was actual abuse you would have to substantiate against everyone at some point.
>  
Mr. Cansler, we have been maliciously persecuted by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services.  What has been done to us is a travesty of justice, and not only unethical, but illegal.  When CPS acts like this children die, this cannot be allowed to continue. 

Please read my complaint, view my documentation and then do something to fix what has been done to us.  We are not child abusers, we were trying to protect two little girls and when we made our report and WCDSS failed in their statutory duties we complained and they punished us for it.

When we went to the regional level NCDSS stated that they had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence, this was a lie.  They never spoke with us or viewed our evidence, someone spoke with me by phone before I contacted Atlanta, but never did anything like they stated to ACF.  And no one from NCDSS ever spoke with Tim and Kristen Wood! 

You are viewed as the principle in a principle, agent relationship with WCDSS, you have the power to rectify this situation, I am asking that you do so. 

I can be reached at 336-874-8133

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

This is the rest of the documents, I am sorry about the information overload, but I find it is the only way to get our story out there.  You have to see it to believe it.  I have also pasted a description of each document that I have sent you in this e-mail. 

I have some e-mails from various government officials too, if you would like to see them.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.  The description of Documents follows my signature.

>>> DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

>>> FORGED SIGNATURE
>>> 
>>> This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse
>>> 
>>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>>> 
>>> My husbands actual signature
>>> 
>>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>>> 
>>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>>> TEETH
>>> 
>>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>>> 
>>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>>> 
>>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>>> 
>>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>>> 
>>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>>> 
>>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>>> 
>>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?
>>> 
>>> COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>>> 
>>> Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.
>>> 
>>> Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.
>>> 
>>> My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.
>>> 
>>> RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>>> 
>>> Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.
>>> 
>>> RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>>> STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>>> 
>>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1
>>> 
>>> This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.
>>> 
>>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2
>>> 
>>> If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.
>>>  
SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4
>>> 
>>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.  But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.
