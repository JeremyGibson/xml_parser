Subject:        Customer complaint (Karen Pearson)

In reference to complaint from Karen Pearson on the Concord Driver License office:
I called 704 784-1328 and spoke with the Mother of Karen Pearson. She stated that Ms. Pearson was not at home at the time and so I gave my name and the reason for my call. She stated that she could give me some information. She stated that Karen and her family had lost their home in Michigan and have moved to North Carolina. They went to the Concord Driver license office and they felt that everyone at the office was rude and snippy and degrading. I asked if she could give me some details so that I could make sure to take care of the problems. She stated that they would take the required papers and that the family had lost the box that contained the Birth Certificates and that the 18 year old had to show proof of residence. She could not give me specific details.

I tried to find out names of the staff and the dates the Pearson's visited the office and she could not remember. She just stated that the lady at the front desk was rude and that all of the staff was rude except for one lady and one of the men. She still could not identify them.

I left my name and cell phone number with the lady I spoke with and asked that she give the information to Ms. Pearson in case she wanted to give me a call. She stated that she would let her know and that they just felt like they should let someone know. She thanked me for calling and thanked me for DMV's attention to this matter.

I apologized for the unpleasant experience by the family and thanked her for letting us know.
I asked if there was anything more I could do for her family and she stated that they had all received their licenses and Thanked me again for calling her.

I will talk to the Senior Examiner in reference to this matter.

Cindy,

Mrs. Kisiah's license was renewed today and it will expire in 2017.  When I spoke with Mr. Kiash, he was not aware of this.  Mr. Kiash inquired about his daughter's license and I told him that I would have to research the situation.  When I spoke with the Joe Franze,District Supervisor he advised that the daughter 's legal presence document expires in June 09, therefore the expiration on any issuance would be the same date. I advised Mr. Franze to contact Mr. Kiash regarding this matter and he did.
Thank you

It's kind of hard to determine the issue, but I think it's that he's not happy with the customer service of his local DMV.
Thanks.

How is it that my wife and daughter who are permanent residence of the United States cannot get their driver’s license renewed because they are holding a conditional card. USCIS makes no distinctions between a permanent residence card and a conditional permanent residence card. They were also treated like crap at the DMV office.

Good Afternoon Cindy,



Chrisleigh Granger received a ticket in Asheboro in 2007.  She has since moved to Nebraska and wants to pay off this ticket.  She has sent payment to DMV and it was returned.  She is requested to make an appearance, but she cannot because of medical ailments and no drivers’ license.



She request the papers needed to pay her fine. 

She is at 1-308-284-0945



Thank you
