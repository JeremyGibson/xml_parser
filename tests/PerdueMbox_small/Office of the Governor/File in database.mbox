Dear Ms. Riddle,
Thank you for your response to my question. I, as well as other homeschool famlies in our co-op, am very appreciative for your help. Will you please be sure that Governor Perdue is aware of this educational dilemma?  When is she available at her Charlotte office, I would love to sit down and discuss this with her or if she is ever out in Union County, we would love for her to come to our home. She seems to have a strong desire for all students in North Carolina to receive an excellent education.   Which is my goal for my children.
Thank you again for your help. 
Konda Starnes

> Thank you for contacting our office regarding Learn and Earn Online.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.

> North Carolina law states that only students enrolled in public schools can take courses via North Carolina Virtual Public Schools and learn and earn Online courses.  It has been agreed that the home school and private schools issue will not be addressed at the state level until next session.  Local school systems can enroll students as "guests" to take classes and charge an administrative fee.  There is no such process for Learn and Earn Online.

> I appreciate your sharing insight regarding the Learn and Earn Online Initiative.  For additional information regarding this program, you may wish to contact the North Carolina Virtual Public School office.  Mr. Bryan Setser, Executive Director, can be reached at 919-513-8550.

> Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue I need your assistance in helping home educated high school students obtain the same privileges as public high school students in enrolling in the Learn & Earn online courses at the community colleges. I have a rising 9th grader and 12th grader that would like the privilege of taking online learn & earn courses but are denied because they are not enrolled in a public school. Please help and advise me with this matter. I thank you in advance for taking the time to address this educational dilemma. If needed, I would be available to be a liaison for home educators and making sure all of their education requirements are also met in North Carolina. I have two older daughters who are currently enrolled at South Piedmont Community College. The oldest is getting her degree in early childhood education and the other in nursing. Thank you, Konda Starnes
