Subject: question

Comment: 9/20/09 Dear Governor Perdue, Iâ€™m writing to you today as a concerned student. Iâ€™m concerned with the amount of corruption thatâ€™s been going on in our states executive position. As you know very well, former Governor Mike Easley abused his power while in office. He did many things that indicated that he was less than noble. Some examples include: Appointment of Mrs. Easley to a very lucrative position with a 170,000 dollar salary at NC State University and many corrupt real estate deals. Will this corruption in North Carolinaâ€™s executive branch persist or will you put an end to it? That is my question. The recent buzz over the lost records of Easleyâ€™s travels during 2005 bothers me. Itâ€™s widely known that Easley was taking advantage of the transportation provided to him as governor for official business. Taking vacations using these resources wasnâ€™t uncommon. I know investigations were conducted to look into the matter and to try to figure out what happened to the record that mysteriously disappeared. When will these records be released to the public? And are you trying to get the report released to the public at all? Now more than ever, our state needs a good leader. Our state has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation and things arenâ€™t getting better very quickly. So if you have the time, please take the opportunity to answer these questions for me, I would be very appreciative. All I would like to know is why the findings from the investigation of the missing travel reports hasnâ€™t been released to the public? Thank you for your time, Dylan K. Hood

Subject: Old North State song, office of governor litterature

Comment: Hi! I am a volunteer in my daughter's third grade class at Sandy Ridge Elementary in Waxhaw, NC. I am woking with the teacher and children on a unit on state government. Although we have found the words/sheet music to the state song, we have been unable to find a recording of it "sung" anywhere. Do you have an available recordings of it or know where we could find one? Also, if you have any litterature available on the office of the governor or the workings of the NC State Assembly, we would love to have some for the kids. We would need about 28. Thank you very much! Mary Jo More
