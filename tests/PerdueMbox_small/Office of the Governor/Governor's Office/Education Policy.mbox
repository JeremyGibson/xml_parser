I am a Reading Specialist in Rowan-Salisbury Schools. I teach children the entire day even though I do not have a classroom. However, I was informed today that I no longer receive Personal Days because the county does not get a substitute teacher for my position. I had to obtain a higher degree as well as an additional certification for my position, but I do not receive the same benefits as my colleagues. I serve 55 children daily instead of a classroom of 24 children. Is the new mandat e being interpreted the way the state intended? If so, how will you be able to tell if all school systems are enforcing this mandate? I have a friend in another county who only serves children for half of the school day, but she still receives Personal Days. How is this fair and equitable? In my own county some Reading Specialist earn Personal Days because their principals decided to contract Substitute Teachers for their positions. Obtaining a Substitute Teacher is a school level decision, so how is that fair and equitable? I would love for you to respond and explain the rationale for decisions of this nature. I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Hello Governor Easley,
Considering that I am a certified teacher currently in a counselor's position, I feel that I should be entitled to the same benefits as other teachers.  I am referring to the new House Bill number 15.  The Title l teachers, the speech therapist and myself are the only ones in our school who will not be able to receive that benefit.  It really upset us that we were not included in this, especially since we don't have to have substitutes when we are absent.  Although I feel that we all are teachers in every way, and should be treated as such, it seems that paying for a personal day would actually make more  since if you did require a substitute.  Could you offer some more explanation for our exclusion?  I  teach the children in guidance classes biweekly in addition to individual sessions, and feel that the many students I see on an individual basis are being taught many important skills to empower themselves in school and life in general.  Thank you!

Very Sincerely,
Diana Aldridge
School Counselor

Dear Gov. Easley,

I am writing on behalf of my granddaughter and the way the NC School of Math and Science has treated her. She was accepted into the school this fall. While there she confided to a dorm mate that she had tried to commit suicide once and had chickened out. The friend told the dorm mother and my daughter was called and asked to come get her. She was told she had to be evaluated and treated before she could come back. We did just as required. She spent a week at the hospital in Chapel Hill and was diagnosed as depressed. She was given medication and set up with regular visits to a psychiatrist and a therapist near Duke and the school. She came back to school, my daughter had to bring her each day and pick her up. On the third day they called and asked her to not come back. Their excuse was that they could not watch her closely enough. Now her therapist and psychiatrist both wrote letters to the school telling them not to ask her to leave, that she would be fine and was under t reatment. They would not listen. Instead they broke the heart of a lovely and very smart young lady. At the same time this was happening, some boys had alcohol in their dorms and they were allowed to stay in school. Yes, they were asked to leave and then were let back in. Now what does that say to other students? If you have to get help for depression you can't attend NCSSM, but if you break the rules drinking, that is okay. I am so upset with the school and how she was treated. She misses her teachers and her new friends terribly. Why would they do this to a child?
I think we have a clear case of medical discrimination. I would love to call our attorney, John Buric, in Charlotte and file a suit, but we are about to go under with our company thanks to this wonderful economy. We are in our sixties and are getting ready to lose all we have worked for. Every day is a struggle and now this is happens to our granddaughter. We would appreciate any help you can give.
Thank you for listening. Ed and Betty Kampschroeder

Dear Mrs. Boujlil,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding entrance to Kindergarten in North Carolina. 



The North Carolina General Assembly voted to change the kindergarten cut off date in order to reduce the age and development gaps between incoming kindergarteners. Children with summer and fall birthdates were more likely to be held back from starting kindergarten than their older classmates, which created a disadvantage within the classroom. Older kindergarteners are more eager to learn, and are better able to pay attention.



You may want to contact your local legislator to express your concerns regarding HB 150, the revised kindergarten cut-off date legislation. To determine who represents you in the General Assembly you can call 919-733-7928.



Thank you for contacting our office.

Subject: New Cut-off date to start school effective 2009-2010

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to appeal to you to please make exceptions to this rule for those children affected by the date change who were already born when this bill was signed and whose parents had already planned on enrolling them in school in the Fall of 2009. (Children born between September 1st and October 16th 2004(for Kindergarten) and 2005 (for Pre-K)). My children attend Highland Mill Montessori, one of the magnet schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg School System. This school has a Pre-K program, that while is not federally funded (parents pay tuition for their children to attend), must be processed through the CMS enrollment office. This is my son’s third year at HMM (Pre-K, K, 1st grade) and he loves it. We had known since my daughter was born on October 6th, 2005, that she would enroll in the Pre-K program at HMM in the Fall of 2009. We knew when we planned our pregnancy with our second baby that we wanted them to be three years apart and also three grades apart. Even though she went a week past her due date, we were relieved that she still made the NC cut-off date and would be able to go to school as planned. You can imagine our dismay when we learned in 2007 that the State had decided to change the cut off date effective the year she was supposed to begin. All our life plans had now been shifted by a year and my daughter’s life had been essentially put “on hold” for a year. My birthday is the end of September and began a pre-K program when I was 3, soon to be 4 and was always ahead of most of my peers in academics, so I have personal experience with being among the youngest in my grade. My daughter is exceptionally sharp and is more than ready to begin Pre-K in the Fall. Please let me know what I can do to help with this process. I know I am not the only parent out there whose child made the old cut-off date but misses the new one and is frustrated with their choices. I have tried to enroll my child in CMS for the Fall and our application was rejected due to the cut-off date change. I have spoken with the Magnet Office, reminding them that this is NOT a federally funded program, PLEASE let her in, but they say their hands are tied by the rulings of the General Assembly and the mandates from the NC Department of Instruction in Raleigh. Please allow the children born within those 6 ½ weeks, whose parents want them to start school “on-time”,to be grandfathered in to the current cut-off date. If that is not possible, please let them be tested to see if they are ready or sign a waiver that if they begin school and the teachers decide they are not ready, the parents will pull them out (Currently there is a test for early Kindergarten, but not early Pre-K). I am very frustrated by this and I know I am not the only one. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear back from each of you. Kierstin Boujlil

Dear Mr. Clark,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding the situation you are trying to resolve regarding your middle school daughter.



After reading your e-mail, I’m not clear on exactly what information you are seeking from Governor Perdue, but I’ll do my best to provide you with useful information.  First, thank you for being such a strong advocate for Tianna.  She is very fortunate to have parents who are so involved in her education.  Parental involvement is a key factor in the educational success of our state’s youth.



If you have not done so, I would suggest you request a meeting with the school’s principal and the school resource officer to try and find out exactly what is going on.  If you have done this and you are not satisfied with the outcome, I would suggest you contact Dr. Ralph Taylor, Director of Safe Schools in the Charlotte/Mecklenburg school system.  He can be reached by dialing 980-343-3000.



Thank you for sharing this information with our office.  Our best to Tianna as she continues her education.

Comment: my child is a student at ranson middle school in charlotte and she has been implemented in a witch hunt about a gang and she is in the sixth grade i know she is not worth you spending a lot of time on but any time would be enough to get to the bottom of this i can't believe that a school official would handle a sixth grader in this matter nevertheless my daughter is a very friendly outgoing person and he says that two boys approached her about being in a gang and he called her in and interogated her as if she was a gang member with no facts and no proof, my daughter is a a/b honor roll student there and i would wish like any caring parent would like to get to the bottom of this debacle.. we don't have time for this witchhunt i would like to have a meeting with the parents of the kids who approached my daughter and the officials at school. i won't stop inquiring for help until i see this situation handled. i would like to see about moving her to another school if at all possible and as history has shown nothing will probably happen at that school to assist us but i will keep blowing the whistle, my kids know we don't approve of this and we are very pro active in their lives.. I am having my first AllProDad breakfast saturday morning for fathers who choose to come and meet at Denny's for breakfast,,it is the first and i can assure you it won't be the last. my daughters name is Tianna L Clark 11yr old in the 6thgrade, i need to know what prompt this acusation my wife went by there today before work and he was still adamant about his accusation but gave my wife no information or any reasons of satisfaction for his actions. I will be writing the Senators office tomorrow should i not hear from you by tomorrow. If you know of whom else i can speak with to help handle this situation i would appreciate it very much, again thanks thomas t clark

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Chappell,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding student assignment issues with the Wake County Public School system.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



I understand your concerns on this issue. As you know, it is the authority of the Wake County Public School system to decide these matters.  I encourage you to share your concerns on this important issue with the Wake County Board of Education and school officials.

Subject: Wake County Schools

Comment: I'm speaking for a very concerned group of parents with children in the Wake County School System. A massive reassignment is being voted on as we speak, and a large part of the changes depend on the NC Supreme Court's ruling on mandatory year round schooling. The board is going through with changes that they admit will have to all be reconfigured depending on the ruling. It seems prudent to hold off on these changes until next year, to explore other options, and see how the court rules. The year round conversions in particular, cost a fortune, not to mention the absolute chaos and disruption they inflict on familes forced onto these schedules. This IS a state issue, because of budget concerns, and the irresponsible use of money for changes that facts do NOT support. We IMPLORE the governer's office to look at these facts immediately, and do everything in its power to put a hold on these expensive, unneccessary changes that families DO NOT WANT. Thank you for your time. Respectfully, Brent and Lisa Chappell

Dear Mr. Emanuel,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding teaching in North Carolina.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



Obviously, you are very interested in becoming a teacher and have many experiences that would benefit you.  I encourage you to proceed in this endeavor. Due to federal "No Child Left Behind" legislation, each state in the nation must ensure that all teachers are highly qualified. The federal guidelines list the following as a definition of "highly qualified teacher:"



    . Holds a bachelor's degree

    . Full certification in the state

    . Demonstrated competence in subject knowledge and teaching skills



A teacher must meet all three of the above criteria to be licensed in any state.  For detailed information about becoming a teacher via the Lateral Entry route, please visit the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction’s website <http://www.ncpublicschools.org/licensure/>http://www.ncpublicschools.org/licensure/ .



Again, we wish you the best in your educational pursuits.

Subject: Teacher in Need

Comment: Hello, my name is Alfred Emanuel. I am a Teacher at the Robeson County Career Center in Lumberton, NC. I am the current Instructor of the Computer Engineering Class. I am a first year Teacher and I began back in August. I entered the system as a Lateral Entry Teacher. Quite recently I was denied a Provisional License by DPI. I am currently working on a degree but I don't have one as we speak. Since I teach a Trade and Industrial Class I need 6 years of experience to be approved. I have 6 years of experience but the State will only approve 4 years. They would not give me 2 years of experience that I gained in High School. Even though I meet the 32 hours a week requirement by the State. I will be leaving this Friday to start looking for another job. I really love teaching and would do anything to continue teaching. I am a Lumbee Indian here in Robeson County and it is said to say that there are not a lot of good Lumbee role models in this county. This class has had a sub for the past two years and will continue to after I leave. It has been a challenge for the Administration to find someone who has the experience in this county to feel the void. If there is anything you can do to help me I would great appriecate it.

Dear Mrs. Murrell,



Thank you for contacting the Governor with your concern regarding education.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



On Monday, Jan. 26th, the Governor announced a re-organization of the education leadership structure in our state that involves the Chairman of the State Board of Education and the Deputy State Superintendent. Prior to the announcement, these were separate positions, one held by Chairman Howard Lee and the other held by JB Buxton. The Governor's announcement deleted the position of the Deputy State Superintendent and combined the powers and duties of that job with the roles of the former Chairman. Gov. Perdue is asking the State Board of Education to redefine the duties of its chair to include the responsibilities of the newly created Chief Executive Officer, who will manage operations of the public school system. Gov. Perdue appointed Dr. Bill Harrison to the Board and is asking the Board members to select him as their chair.



The Governor's announcement does not change the responsibilities and duties of the elected state superintendent, Dr. Atkinson. As a matter of fact, the Governor announced that she has asked Dr. Atkinson to take on an additional task of heading up a statewide blue-ribbon task force on career development and workforce issues that are so critical to the economic and education backbone of the state.



Again, thank you for sharing your concerns with the Governor.



Sincerely,



Ann McArthur

Comment: Governor Perdue, Congratulations on moving this state forward into the 21st century! I would like to know what happens now to the ELECTED POSITION of State Superintendent of Education (Ms. June Atkinson. Although I applaud positive changes to NC's education system, I somehow feel that my ONE VOTE back on Nov. 4th did not make a difference. To dissolve an elected position for a paid position without prior justification somehow doesn't feel good to my spirit.I cast a vote that is no longer valid. I am really concerned about future appointments versus elected positions. Charmaine Murrell 910-286-3533

Yes, we've inundated the school board with letters, but unfortunately they aren't receptive. The public school community of Wake County is in tremendous chaos at the moment. ALL CHANGES INVOLVING CONVERTING SCHOOLS TO YEAR ROUND CALENDARS NEED TO BE HALTED UNTIL THE NC SUPREME COURT HAS RULED ON THIS MATTER. If your office has any way of stepping in, it seems highly appropriate, given how much state money is involved.

Thank you,

Subject: College Student with a Heavy Heart

Comment: I hope this letter finds you all in good health and spirits. My name is Larry Antoine Peterman; I am currently a freshman at Johnson C. Smith University studying Communications. I am writing with a heavy heart, as some of you know my parents are not doing very well financially and this has affected my ability to pay for school. I have been asked to leave on administrative terms because of this fact. Due to the economic situation the country is in I am unable to acquire a student loan from any financial institutions. They are not lending to anyone. So, what I am asking is if you can give something, anything as a charitable donation to assist me in continuing my college education. If you would like to call it a loan, I promise to pay it back. I will keep impeccable records of each donation so that I can repay you for your help. I will also keep you all abreast of my grades if that is something that would be satisfactory to you. I know some of you are wondering how I will pay my tuition for next semester if I can not pay this one. Well, I will be enlisting in the Army ROTC in order to continue my education. This is not something that I want to do but, my education is just that important to me. I came to JCSU with the intention of success and I have achieved this success. I have learned the importance of education and have worked very hard this past semester. I have A’s and B’s in all my classes and I am very proud of this fact. I am a graduate of Plainfield High School in NJ and during my time there I did well but, not this well. I am so proud and my family is proud, they are very hurt and ashamed that they can not help me the way they would like. The amount I will need for me to continue is $3899.24 and I need to raise this amount by December 19, 2008. I know that this is a large sum but, every little bit helps and will get me closer to reaching my goal. I know that it is holiday time and that my parents are not alone in their financial woes but, I just ask for you to consider helping a student finish his education. If you would like to be a part of my continued success please email me and I will give you the information on how you can donate. Respectfully Yours, Larry Antoine Peterman Struggling College Student

Subject: PLEASE LISTEN AND HELP

Comment: Governor Perdue, I need help. For years I have gotten absolutely nowhere. In 2001 at the age of 19, I enrolled in Brookstone College. I applied for a grant and what the grant didn't cover, I was given a loan. After just 3-4 months, I learned the school was not credited and all the down falls that came with that. I then dropped out and returned to work for that reason and other financial issues. I immediately started getting billed for the loan. I tried contacting the school and The College Foundation unsure why I would have to pay the whole loan being that I didn't attend even half of the term. Why Brookstone was able to keep the money. Noone ever listened to me or my concern. I was always told that I was still responsible for paying it. 4,100 was just intercepted by the IRS. I was very decestated being that my family could have finally after so much struggling move ourselves out of this never ending financial hole. I thought the one positive out of this was that I could go back to school and build a career like I have been wanting to do, but this loan has prevented me from doing this. After reading the NCSEAA website trying to find a way to pull up myloan to see if it was paid off. I read something that appeared to me to mean that if I didn't complete the school that the loan should have gone to me. I then called NCSEAA to find out my balance and asked her why the school was allowed to keep the loan money. For the very first time I was told that when I left the school, I was suppose to call The College Foundation and tell them and then the loan would be returned from Brooksone to them. After all the calls I made and people that I spoke, noone ever told me this. And it should have been known that I no longer attend the school because students were not to be billed until after completion, but I was being billed after 4 months and did not complete. I don't feel that this is fight nor fair. Please help me to resolve this. Thank you, Candice Owens

Comment: I am a convicted felon for having a Class C weapon without a license, convicted in 1999. I was never in trouble prior nor since that incident and have always owned and operated my own business. I now am faced with looking for work and possibly schooling but need help finding work and funding. Does North Carolina have any programs offered for returning to college? Would I even be able to find employment as a convicted felon? I have found the conviction has prevented some business from hiring me. I still plan to continue running my business to pay bills and keep my family up but want more security by returning to school. I like my business and hope to continue the business but in this economy, find it difficult. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Comment: Congratulations on a great victory. God be with you and your family. I am writing you today about CMS, while we all face great challenges across this nation and around the world; more than ever we need to rain-in out of control management. Education is just the financial sector, out of control - Like everyone else CMS will take a hit, and as usual Peter Gorman will lay the burden on the schools, while he continues to build an empire downtown. Five years ago less than 50 people made over $100,000.00 in CMS, now we have over 100 and not one of them teaches! It isn't brain surgery, more quality teachers, smaller classrooms and a few more computers with some creativity would pay great off quickly (decentralize). Mr. Gorman is just a glorified PR man, he is not an educator. All the fluff he's added in CMS hasn't made a difference these past few years. Then there's the dysfunctional board led by the infamous "Coach" Joe, but that's another story for another time! Release the hounds! Good Luck!!! Robert C. Rosso

Dear Ms. Feaster,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding school crossing guard uniforms.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



It is unclear what school system you are referring to, but the issue you mention is under the authority of your local school board.  I would encourage you to contact your local school superintendent and share your concerns with him/her.



Thank you for sharing your concerns with our office.

Subject: A way to save my tax dollars and cut some excess spending





It has come to my attention that we are spending an excessive amount of

money dressing our crossing guards. I believe it is the amount of $800.00 in

uniforms so they can look much like a police officer while they are

assisting our children across the streets to school. I believe this is

ridiculous. Please put a stop to this spending.

My tax dollars not being put to good use.

Dear Ms. Harris:



Thank you for your correspondence regarding paying for college.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue.



First of all, we are grateful for your kind words of encouragement and affirmation.  Please know that as the Governor continues on this journey to move North Carolina forward, she’ll need constituents like you to remain actively engaged in the work that is before us. 



You are to be commended for your hard work and dedication to relentlessly pursue your education.  We are so proud of your commitment to stay motivated to see your goals through to fruition.  The issues you describe regarding your need to handle current and future payments for education are understandable.  Paying for school can be quite a financial commitment coupled with day-to-day, on-going financial obligations.  If you have not, I recommend that you contact the North Carolina State Higher Education Assistance Authority (NCSHEAA) at P.O. Box 13663, RTP, NC  27709 or by phone at

919/549-8614 to speak directly with a loan representative.  The staff at NCSHEAA is equipped and knowledgeable of various financial assistance options in place to aid in paying for school.  They should be able to advise you based on the specific circumstances relating to your financial needs.



            Thank you again for contacting our office. 



                                                                                                            Sincerely,

Email: kimberdyn@yahoo.com

Subject: Education/Student Loans

Comment: I have student loans in default which I have tried on several ocassions to rectify the matter. However, I'm always told what I have to pay instead of what I really can pay. The last time I tried to deal with the matter I was working a part-time job only making about $500-$600 per month and I was told my minimum payment was $400+ There was absolutely no way possible for me to do that and still provide for my family which I am a single parent with three children. I guess my question is, how can I get out of default with the budget that I do have? And, if the Presidents Stimulus Package is for the common people to spend in order to boost the economy, how could that possibly happen when because my student loans are in default, the government is going to take that money, and I won't get it just as I have not gotten my federal returns since...forever. Would you please advise me on these concerns at your earliest convenience. Thank you kindly and of course CONGRATULATIONS on your victory into office!

Dear Mr. Fresse,



Thank you for your e-mail regarding plans to have French students visit you and your school district.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



After reading your e-mail, I took the liberty of doing a little research.  I was able to find a couple of resources that may be useful to you.  First, you can contact the North Carolina Center for International Understanding.  They are located in Raleigh.  You can reach them by telephone at 919.420.1360.  They also have a website: <http://ciu.northcarolina.edu/content.php/system/index.htm>http://ciu.northcarolina.edu/content.php/system/index.htm



Additionally, you may want to contact Dr. Fran Nolan, Executive Director of the Grassroots Science Museums Collaborative.  You can dial him at 919.733.7450 x260, and you can view the website:  <http://www.grassroots-science.org/>www.grassroots-science.org .  I am sure Dr. Nolan would be delighted to discuss options and activities with you regarding the students you mention.



I hope you will find this information useful.  Thank you for contacting our office.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, The Superintendent and Whiteville City School Board have voted in favor of having a mandatory uniform policy for all students for the coming school year. Is the North Carolina School System governing body aware of the new poliy being enacted in Whiteville? If so is the Scool Board allowed to mandate a uniform policy? There is great opposition here to the uniform policy but it seems our Superintendent Shaver does not care. Please let me know my options with organizing support to disband the uniiform policy here at Whiteville City Schools. There is also a question of having mandated that students can only purchase required uniforms from approved sources. I question the motives and constitutionality of this mandate. any help and guidance on this issue will be appreciated. Thanks, T Ciamillo

Dear Ms. McLawhorn:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding public education in North Carolina.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



Purchasing of school supplies is the authority of each local school district.  The state allocated funds for such purchases based on the average daily membership and the local school district determines how the funds are spent within each school.



As you know, the global economic crisis has caused unprecedented budget shortfalls across the country and in North Carolina, which faces a shortfall of more than $2 billion.  While Governor Perdue has asked state agencies to cut back spending, public schools have been spared the most drastic of the cuts and she has stated that classroom spending should be protected as best as possible. However, it is still up to each local school district  as to where to find the necessary funds to make the reversions to the state.



I encourage your daughter-in-law to discuss this issue with her principal.  Many schools have funds, often through the PTA, to assist classrooms with needed supplies.

Subject: Education

Comment: Hi Governor Perdue and staff: Hello again! As a passionate educator in North Carolina, I have concerns about the lack of environmental education in our current K-12 curriculum. I feel strongly that we need a strand of the curriculum that speaks to our committment to environmental awareness and stewardship. Our young people can help redefine green citizenship and even hold the adults in their lives more accountable. If we are going to add "green collar jobs" in any significant amount, the people of North Carolina will need to buy-in to the critical understanding of such a life style change. Please contact me for more information on my ideas for this curriculum. I believe that we must start with the young people. Suburbia is at least aware of stewardship but much of rural North Carolina is left in the dark about why changing our behavior is best for North Carolina and our economy. Thank you, Heather Soja

Thank you. 



So many children and their families are desperately in need of your leadership on this issue.  It is critical that these children receive academic instruction.  They have greater ability than even the “experts” are capable of forecasting.  The public school has the power to determine level of capability for these children and limit their educational programs in accordance with that determination.  If the parents disagree and even prove to the school system that their child functions above that determination and asks for greater access to academic instruction, the school system simply says “no” and the parent has to fight the system in court to increase educational opportunity for their child.  It can take years to have your case heard by a judge which is critical time lost in educating the child.



Without proper skills and academic education, these children will grow into adults requiring full institutionalized or halfway house care.  Many of them that are currently judged “uneducable” by the public school system are, in fact, very intelligent and could go on to live fully independent adult lives and some could make significant quality-of-life improvements to society. 



This is a crisis situation now that will be a greater crisis situation in the future if we do not make reasonable, cost effective and cost manageable changes now. 



I look forward to hearing from you.  The children need you.

Subject: Special Education

Comment: My son is now 14 years old and has been tormented in Wake County Public Schools for the past 9 years. From K-7, he attended 7 different schools. He was not taught to read in Kindergarten because the Spec Ed teacher decided he was "uneducable" and it was not worthwhile to work on academic instruction. I bought Hooked on Phonics and within 6 weeks he was reading at a 1st grade 7 month level. My son is gifted in math and science and has made A's in mainstream classes; however, I have had to teach him at home because the teachers would not work with him. My son has been physically and psychologically abused by both staff and students during his years in the school system and I removed him last May because the school administrators told me that if he ran away from school again, they would chase him, tackle him and put him in handcuffs. He was running away because of the physical abuse that they told me they couldn't prove was happening because no one involved would admit what they did to him. They said that his injuries could have been self inflicted. I sued the school system in 2002 and the case was finally heard in 2005 - the school system is allowed to delay hearing for years and during that time the school puts pressure on the family to drop the suit. When it was clear to them that I wouldn't drop the suit, the school system finally placed my son with a teacher who actually followed the law and provided an appropriate program. He was with this teacher for 2 years and had no behavior problems during that time. His teacher loved him and my son thrived in the program she organized for him. This program was not extravagant and, although I cannot get the financial details from the school system, I would bet that the two years my son was in this appropriate program cost far less than any other single year he spent in an inappropriate program. Doing the right thing cost less. I was able to focus on my job and earned a promotion that brought our income up so that I could provide more services for my son. He was not stressed everyday at school so his doctor took him off medication and his physical health and overall wellbeing improved - it was a much needed period of stability in what had been a tumultuous life because of the issues at school. There are children suffering in our school system every day and it is not in the interest of the citizens of this state to allow the harm to continue. It cost more now and will cost an incredible amount in the future as these children age out of the school system and don't have even basic skills to maintain any level of independent living. I would like to speak with someone about this serious issue that needs and warrants immediate attention. Plese help us. Cheryl Everette

Subject: School Nutrition Waste

Comment: Governor Perdue, As a concerned taxpayer I sincerely urge you to investigate waste within the public school nutrition programs. I am a retired school teacher (30 years in Martin County high schools.) This year I have been blessed to work in a K-5 school parttime. Breakfasts and lunches are wonderful and most of the students eat both. I have been admonished by the cafeteria manager for collecting unopened milk and juices to use at snacktime because they are supposed to be thrown away. The students are told to take the food because it is paid for and throw it away if it is not used. This happens in every school in Martin County, according to my colleagues. If this is happening statewide, how much money is being wasted on food products. During this dire economic trial we are experiencing we teach recycling, adding and removing clothes to save energy, conserve fuel,etc. Yet we tell our youngsters to THROW FOOD AWAY. It sickens me just to think about it. Please look into this matter just to see if something can be done. Thank you for your time. I know you have the welfare of North Carolina at the top of your list. Beverly Rogerson bbrogerson@embarqmail.com

Subject: Assistance needed with local school system and diabetic child

Comment: My 8 yr old son is in need of your help. On January 5th 2008 JT was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. He was in the first grade. At the time of his diagnosis JT was required to take over 6 shots a day and check his blood sugar atleast 7 times a day. I (his mother) spent the better part of a month at the school to make sure that everyone was comfortable and trained as to how to properly take care of my son. In May of 2008 Jt's doctor along with my husband and myself felt that JT would benefit from being on an insulin pump. The insulin pump works similarly to a pancreas in that it gives a small dose of insulin every 3 mins. At that time I offered to train the ENTIRE school as to how to work the pump. I also contacted the company that manufactured the insulin pump, they were (and still are) willing to send their education team out to the school to train. The school nurse declined. Said that we would cross this bridge when we got closer to the new school year. The summer came and went. JT was doing great, he was in good control of his blood sugar, he was gaining back weight that had been lost earlier in the year, he was happy again for the first time in months, he was truly happy... and he wasn't scared that his blood sugar would prevent him from being able to do things. As the beginning of the school year approached, I contacted the school nurse numerous times... finally going down to the school the week before classes were to begin. We held a small training with only the 2 office staff, and at that time I was told that only the nurse would be allowed to do anything with the insulin pump. I said that it would be impossible for me to be at the school everyday so she needed to train the staff on the pump. I was assured that they would be. 3 weeks into the school year I requested that JT start testing his blood sugar in the office instead of the classroom. I was told at that time that they would make arrangements for him to be taken care of properly. By November 2008 JT was refusing to go to school, stating that he "Hated school", he started to refuse to do his homework, he became very disrespectful to everyone, including teachers. I requested a log of his blood sugars at school and found that his blood sugar was completely out of control. I started at that time to request that additional trainings take place. I received no reply. In early December my husband and I experienced the death of a close friend... his funeral was scheduled for the same day as a field trip for JT. I was told by his teacher that if I could not go on the field trip to take care of him that he probably wouldn't be able to go. I was furious. I immediately called the principal stating that he needed to make sure that the school nurse was there to take care of my child. I was told at that time that they would make sure that JT was taken care of on the field trip and that he would have a "1-on-1". I admit that I was completely skeptical of this and I sent JT on his field trip with my Blackberry programmed as to when he was to check his blood sugar, and eat. I was not going to take any chances on the student teacher assigned to him putting him in any danger. Later that week I went to the school for a party in JT's class, to help the teacher figure out how many carbs JT had consumed and calculate his insulin dosage for his insulin pump. At that time I was told by the school nurse "it's not in my contract to take care of a child on an insulin pump". At that moment, I realized that there was a complete disregard for my childs well being. I found out the next day that his A1C (a fancy blood test that gives you an average of what your blood sugars are daily, the lower the A1C the better you have control of your blood sugar 6 is average) was a 9.2. Up 2 whole points since the beginning of the school year. I called the superintendents office and spoke with Dr. Nolte, the assistant, and informed him that my child would not return to school until the staff was trained properly! I was not going to subject my child to a life filled with severe complications because the people who are charged with taking care of him everyday are not doing just that. I also at that time asked for a 504 plan. I was told that he did not qualify for a 504 plan because he did not have any mental handicaps. I still insisted on having one. I also spoke with the principal and told him that he needed to correct this immediately. In January there was a collaborative meeting put in place, where Dr. Nolte informed the school nurse that he wanted a step-by-step care plan in place for JT... He wanted to know exactly who was doing what, and when, and what to do if that person was not available. My husband and I were pleased. We felt as if the school was really going to work with us on this. Jt was absent the entire month of January (with the exception of 4 days) because of the school not furnishing the revised care plan. Once I received it I reviewed it and made notes as to what was wrong with it. and spoke with the school nurse to explain to her that this "new" plan was the same thing that was already in place. And I would not sign it. The school social worker was then sent to my house to try and coerce me to sign it. My husband clearly stated that neither of us would sign that form. Yesterday the social worker returned to my house with a Waynesville Police officer with the forms again. I was at a private school enrolling JT at this time, because my husband and I had decided that we had had enough of trying to work with Haywood County Public School. Jt's A1C this month was down to an 8.1... I was able to prove my point that him being in a situation where they did not know how to take care of him, was detrimental to his health. Today, this morning, the school social worker again came to my house with letters from the school principal stating that I would be charged with Medical Neglect for not signing the care plan. And that by me keeping him out of school I would be charged with academic neglect for all 3 of my children. As of this morning at 10am, none of my children are enrolled in Haywood County Public Schools, because of this. This is insane that a principal would go to such great lengths to not take care of a child. All I have asked for is for them to treat him according to his doctors orders. and this is impossible for them to do. I asked for a 504 plan on 2 separate occasions, and I was denied. Parent to parent, I am asking you to please intervene and make this right. It is not fair for my children to have to leave all of their friends because of 1 school refusing to step up to the plate and do what they are required by federal law to do. Thank you so much for your time and prompt attention to this matter, Amber Fuller

Dear Mr. Mills:

<mailto:teri.riddle@nc.gov> 

Thank you for contacting the Governor with your concern regarding the  recent reorganization of the positions held by the  former Deputy State Superintendent and Chairman of the State Board of Education. I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



On Monday, Jan. 26th, the Governor announced a re-organization of the education leadership structure in our state that involves the Chairman of the State Board of Education and the Deputy State Superintendent. Prior to the announcement, these were separate positions, one held by Chairman Howard Lee and the other held by JB Buxton. The Governor's announcement deleted the position of the Deputy State Superintendent and combined the powers and duties of that job with the roles of the former Chairman. Gov. Perdue is asking the State Board of Education to redefine the duties of its chair to include the responsibilities of the newly created Chief Executive Officer, who will manage operations of the public school system. Gov. Perdue appointed Dr. Bill Harrison to the Board and is asking the Board members to select him as their chair.



The Governor's announcement does not change the responsibilities and duties of the elected state superintendent, Dr. Atkinson. As a matter of fact, the Governor announced that she has asked Dr. Atkinson to take on an additional task of heading up a statewide blue-ribbon task force on career development and workforce issues that are so critical to the economic and education backbone of the state.



Again, thank you for sharing your concerns with the Governor.

My questions are: Is'nt the state education lottery for the education system? If so, why was'nt a playground allowed into the school budget? If our schools are forcing good nutrition in the cafeteria, why are we promoting excercise by providing the school a playground? Thank you for your time. I really feel it is sad that the tax paying parents are forced to do fundraisers for this project.

Subject: Assistance needed with local school system and diabetic child

Comment: My 8 yr old son is in need of your help. On January 5th 2008 JT was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. He was in the first grade. At the time of his diagnosis JT was required to take over 6 shots a day and check his blood sugar atleast 7 times a day. I (his mother) spent the better part of a month at the school to make sure that everyone was comfortable and trained as to how to properly take care of my son. In May of 2008 Jt's doctor along with my husband and myself felt that JT would benefit from being on an insulin pump. The insulin pump works similarly to a pancreas in that it gives a small dose of insulin every 3 mins. At that time I offered to train the ENTIRE school as to how to work the pump. I also contacted the company that manufactured the insulin pump, they were (and still are) willing to send their education team out to the school to train. The school nurse declined. Said that we would cross this bridge when we got closer to the new school year. The summer came and went. JT was doing great, he was in good control of his blood sugar, he was gaining back weight that had been lost earlier in the year, he was happy again for the first time in months, he was truly happy... and he wasn't scared that his blood sugar would prevent him from being able to do things. As the beginning of the school year approached, I contacted the school nurse numerous times... finally going down to the school the week before classes were to begin. We held a small training with only the 2 office staff, and at that time I was told that only the nurse would be allowed to do anything with the insulin pump. I said that it would be impossible for me to be at the school everyday so she needed to train the staff on the pump. I was assured that they would be. 3 weeks into the school year I requested that JT start testing his blood sugar in the office instead of the classroom. I was told at that time that they would make arrangements for him to be taken care of properly. By November 2008 JT was refusing to go to school, stating that he "Hated school", he started to refuse to do his homework, he became very disrespectful to everyone, including teachers. I requested a log of his blood sugars at school and found that his blood sugar was completely out of control. I started at that time to request that additional trainings take place. I received no reply. In early December my husband and I experienced the death of a close friend... his funeral was scheduled for the same day as a field trip for JT. I was told by his teacher that if I could not go on the field trip to take care of him that he probably wouldn't be able to go. I was furious. I immediately called the principal stating that he needed to make sure that the school nurse was there to take care of my child. I was told at that time that they would make sure that JT was taken care of on the field trip and that he would have a "1-on-1". I admit that I was completely skeptical of this and I sent JT on his field trip with my Blackberry programmed as to when he was to check his blood sugar, and eat. I was not going to take any chances on the student teacher assigned to him putting him in any danger. Later that week I went to the school for a party in JT's class, to help the teacher figure out how many carbs JT had consumed and calculate his insulin dosage for his insulin pump. At that time I was told by the school nurse "it's not in my contract to take care of a child on an insulin pump". At that moment, I realized that there was a complete disregard for my childs well being. I found out the next day that his A1C (a fancy blood test that gives you an average of what your blood sugars are daily, the lower the A1C the better you have control of your blood sugar 6 is average) was a 9.2. Up 2 whole points since the beginning of the school year. I called the superintendents office and spoke with Dr. Nolte, the assistant, and informed him that my child would not return to school until the staff was trained properly! I was not going to subject my child to a life filled with severe complications because the people who are charged with taking care of him everyday are not doing just that. I also at that time asked for a 504 plan. I was told that he did not qualify for a 504 plan because he did not have any mental handicaps. I still insisted on having one. I also spoke with the principal and told him that he needed to correct this immediately. In January there was a collaborative meeting put in place, where Dr. Nolte informed the school nurse that he wanted a step-by-step care plan in place for JT... He wanted to know exactly who was doing what, and when, and what to do if that person was not available. My husband and I were pleased. We felt as if the school was really going to work with us on this. Jt was absent the entire month of January (with the exception of 4 days) because of the school not furnishing the revised care plan. Once I received it I reviewed it and made notes as to what was wrong with it. and spoke with the school nurse to explain to her that this "new" plan was the same thing that was already in place. And I would not sign it. The school social worker was then sent to my house to try and coerce me to sign it. My husband clearly stated that neither of us would sign that form. Yesterday the social worker returned to my house with a Waynesville Police officer with the forms again. I was at a private school enrolling JT at this time, because my husband and I had decided that we had had enough of trying to work with Haywood County Public School. Jt's A1C this month was down to an 8.1... I was able to prove my point that him being in a situation where they did not know how to take care of him, was detrimental to his health. Today, this morning, the school social worker again came to my house with letters from the school principal stating that I would be charged with Medical Neglect for not signing the care plan. And that by me keeping him out of school I would be charged with academic neglect for all 3 of my children. As of this morning at 10am, none of my children are enrolled in Haywood County Public Schools, because of this. This is insane that a principal would go to such great lengths to not take care of a child. All I have asked for is for them to treat him according to his doctors orders. and this is impossible for them to do. I asked for a 504 plan on 2 separate occasions, and I was denied. Parent to parent, I am asking you to please intervene and make this right. It is not fair for my children to have to leave all of their friends because of 1 school refusing to step up to the plate and do what they are required by federal law to do. Thank you so much for your time and prompt attention to this matter, Amber Fuller

Subject: School Nutrition Waste

Comment: Governor Perdue, As a concerned taxpayer I sincerely urge you to investigate waste within the public school nutrition programs. I am a retired school teacher (30 years in Martin County high schools.) This year I have been blessed to work in a K-5 school parttime. Breakfasts and lunches are wonderful and most of the students eat both. I have been admonished by the cafeteria manager for collecting unopened milk and juices to use at snacktime because they are supposed to be thrown away. The students are told to take the food because it is paid for and throw it away if it is not used. This happens in every school in Martin County, according to my colleagues. If this is happening statewide, how much money is being wasted on food products. During this dire economic trial we are experiencing we teach recycling, adding and removing clothes to save energy, conserve fuel,etc. Yet we tell our youngsters to THROW FOOD AWAY. It sickens me just to think about it. Please look into this matter just to see if something can be done. Thank you for your time. I know you have the welfare of North Carolina at the top of your list. Beverly Rogerson bbrogerson@embarqmail.com

Dear Mr. Rogers:



Thank you for your e-mail regarding the Marine Technology program at Cape Fear Community College.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



We appreciate your taking time to share your concerns with us.   As you know, we are facing an unprecedented budget shortfall in North Carolina due to the economic downfall that is being felt nationwide. Governor Perdue is committed to protecting education as much as possible during this economic crisis.  While state agencies are being asked to identify specific areas for reduction, please note that the Community College system is not recommending any cuts to instruction; therefore, there are no plans to cut the Marine Technology program that you mention. 



In the next few weeks the Governor will [resent her budget to the NC General Gernaral Assembly to begin the budget process for this year. Additionally, the impact of the federal stimuls funds is still being considered and will continue to play a part in the decisions the legisaltors will make in the coming months as they prepare a final budget to give to the Governor.  You may track this work daily by visiting <http://www.ncleg.net/>www.ncleg.net



Thank you for contacting our office and for your continued support of education in North Carolina.



Sincerely,

Teri Riddle

NC Office of the Governor

Subject: Marine Technology program at Cape Fear Community College

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: This letter is written in support of the Marine Technology program at Cape Fear Community College. I have recently become aware of the plans to eliminate the funding for this nationally known program. As the only institution in the state that can provide this type of training, the educational community would lose a highly successful program that has been in existence for over 40 years along with the knowledge and technical know-how of the program and its staff—to lose this would be shortsighted and wasteful. As most of us are painfully aware, North Carolina is experiencing its highest unemployment rate in years. Community colleges have traditionally played an intricate roll in retooling the workforce during times of high unemployment and economic hardship. The amount of money to be saved by eliminating the funding for the Marine Technology program is miniscule as compared to the benefits this program produces in this economy—JOBS. This program enrolls many four-year college graduates who have been unable to find jobs. After completing the Marine Technology program, graduates have a very high placement rate—again, JOBS—due to the fact that they are taught technical skills that no other schools are teaching. Now is not the time to cut funding for successful job-training programs. In addition, as the only program of it kind on the East Coast, the Marine Technology program is experiencing wildly successful enrollment levels which translates into money being pumped into the local economy, a big plus for the community during financial hard times. In light of the focus by all levels of government to retool workers and restart our economy, I ask you to reconsider and restore the funding for the Marine Technology program at Cape Fear Community College. Sincerely, Carol Rogers Richard Rogers 333 Lonicera Court Wilmington, NC 28411

Subject: Special Education

Comment: My son is now 14 years old and has been tormented in Wake County Public Schools for the past 9 years. From K-7, he attended 7 different schools. He was not taught to read in Kindergarten because the Spec Ed teacher decided he was "uneducable" and it was not worthwhile to work on academic instruction. I bought Hooked on Phonics and within 6 weeks he was reading at a 1st grade 7 month level. My son is gifted in math and science and has made A's in mainstream classes; however, I have had to teach him at home because the teachers would not work with him. My son has been physically and psychologically abused by both staff and students during his years in the school system and I removed him last May because the school administrators told me that if he ran away from school again, they would chase him, tackle him and put him in handcuffs. He was running away because of the physical abuse that they told me they couldn't prove was happening because no one involved would admit what they did to him. They said that his injuries could have been self inflicted. I sued the school system in 2002 and the case was finally heard in 2005 - the school system is allowed to delay hearing for years and during that time the school puts pressure on the family to drop the suit. When it was clear to them that I wouldn't drop the suit, the school system finally placed my son with a teacher who actually followed the law and provided an appropriate program. He was with this teacher for 2 years and had no behavior problems during that time. His teacher loved him and my son thrived in the program she organized for him. This program was not extravagant and, although I cannot get the financial details from the school system, I would bet that the two years my son was in this appropriate program cost far less than any other single year he spent in an inappropriate program. Doing the right thing cost less. I was able to focus on my job and earned a promotion that brought our income up so that I could provide more services for my son. He was not stressed everyday at school so his doctor took him off medication and his physical health and overall wellbeing improved - it was a much needed period of stability in what had been a tumultuous life because of the issues at school. There are children suffering in our school system every day and it is not in the interest of the citizens of this state to allow the harm to continue. It cost more now and will cost an incredible amount in the future as these children age out of the school system and don't have even basic skills to maintain any level of independent living. I would like to speak with someone about this serious issue that needs and warrants immediate attention. Plese help us. Cheryl Everette

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I would like to ask you for two minutes of your time to learn about Eduminder (www.Eduminder.org) and how it will help schools and districts save money, become more efficient and improve the education process. Eduminder is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide FREE internet based administrative, educational and student tools for primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The tools will also provide a platform for collaboration and information sharing among schools across districts, nations, continents and cultures. I am asking you to help us with the following: 1. Support Eduminder with a initial funding, and assistance obtaining additional funding 2. Introduce Eduminder to School Superintendents and Administrators, as awareness and support is critical, and finally 3. Assist Eduminder in “spreading the word” in Washington and among your fellow Governors – your direct involvement and advocacy is extremely important. The global economic downturn, and resulting school budget cuts and closings, is making the support for Eduminder even more critical: Eduminder is an essential solution at this time. Time is running out. The impact of the school budget cuts will be felt this fall if not sooner. Your support is greatly appreciated and needed, for together we will make a difference. Please feel free to contact me should you wish more information about Eduminder. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Dear Mr. Johnson:



Thank you for your email inquiry regarding school budgetary concerns.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue.



We appreciate your taking time to express your thoughts in writing.  You raise some valid points regarding budget concerns.  As I’m sure you know, these are times of economic turbulence.  At this juncture, every entity is experiencing painful cuts to their financial streams.    



Governor Perdue is committed to protecting education during this economic crisis.  Included below is one of the Governor’s latest press releases announcing her plans to manage the budget, with an emphasis on shielding education.



Thank you again for contacting our office.  We appreciate your support and active engagement in education in North Carolina.

Governor Perdue Takes Additional Steps to Manage Budget Shortfall





As part of Gov. Perdue’s ongoing efforts to manage the current fiscal year budget shortfall, she is taking the following steps under Executive Order No. 6:



* Asking most state agencies for further reduction amounts from 7 percent to 9 percent.  Governor Perdue will continue to protect public education as much as possible while managing the shortfall.
* As a precautionary step to manage cash flow, the state will transfer up to $300 million dollars from several special accounts into the General Fund.  The money will be put into a reserve and may be used to support General Fund obligations if necessary. These transfers will be managed so that existing activities supported by these special funds aren't impacted.  The state annually faces cash flow issues between mid-February and April 15.  The state's cash position is more heavily impacted this year because final corporate payments are now due by April 15, 2009, rather than March 15, 2009.




Reserve                                                           Transfer Amount         Current Cash Balance



Education Lottery Reserve Fund                   $50 million                  $50 million

Clean Water Management Trust Fund           $100 million                $251 million

Public School Building Capital Fund             $100 million                $316 million

Public School Textbook Fund                        $50 million                  $65 million

Total                                                               $300 million               $682 million





“The state constitution requires that I balance the state budget, and I will do that while protecting public education as much as possible,” said Gov. Perdue

Subject: Education Funding-- Tough Times

Comment: I'm a public school teacher whose Superintendent came to speak with us the other day regarding possible budget cuts due to current shortfalls at the state level. He said that we are to prepare for cuts between the 3 to 7 percent range. I just don't see where that sort of money could come from. For my district, it would mean 96 thousand dollars per school. That's a lot of money in a system that has little money to start with. This year, for example, we received 100 dollars for supplies. The best solutions we "faculty" could come up with were-- 1) giving up supply money 2) taking a pay cut accross the board in order to preserve jobs 2) discontinuing testing. In summation, I think it is going to be really difficult to cut funds from education, or public safety. Thanks

Dear Ms. Riddle,



I appreciate your reply.  The DPI will not help.   



The issue is that most of the schools don’t want our special needs children with neurological differences.

They know the law provides for these children to attend school so they allow unchallenged attendance as long as the parent accepts that their child will not receive the same educational opportunities as mainstream students.  If the parent presses for full academic access, the school retaliates by allowing increased negative pressure to be placed on the child until disruptive behavior results.  These behaviors are then recorded and followed by a series of suspensions leading to either expulsion or the parent withdrawing their child from school.



After I was told my son would be chased down, physically restrained and handcuffed if he attempted to leave school to avoid physical abuse at the hands of other students, I removed him from the middle school he had been attending last year.  He only attended school 2 days of the 4th quarter.  When I received his transcripts, Reedy Creek Middle School had recorded that my son had passed 7th grade (a month before the year ended) and that he had made As and Bs in all of his classes for 4th quarter (when he had not been exposed to any of the information presented during that quarter and certainly had not legitimately earned those grades).  The public school system does not believe special education children should be considered on the same level with mainstream children and that anything the individual schools decide to do with the student and their academic record is fine.  Those grades are further proof that Special Education in Wake County Public Schools amounts to public fraud and someone should organized an audit of the program to determine how monies are being spent and how these children are managed in each of the schools.



I have spoken with NC Legislative Rep. Jennifer Weiss, the DPI, Robert Sturey (Director of Special Education Wake County Public Schools), and members of the Wake County School Board.  They all acknowledge there are serious problems with Special Education but they have all said they cannot help. 



Please let me know who can help.



Thank you.

Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

I hope this message reaches you in good health.  I am e-mailing you because i am a supporter of yours and i currently see the things you are doing to help our economy.  I remember you saying that you wanted to Bridge the Gap between rural and urban schools. 

Governor I ask you to to take a look at a current situation we are having here in Raleigh NC where my sons' school is located. The Board of Education is currently trying to close Torchilight Acadamy down after 10 years of active service, commitment, and accomplishments to our community and and thier students.   My sons' name is Zion Janvier and he has been attending Torchlight Academy on Bramer Dr. off of Atlantic Avenue for 2 years now.  My Son has been doing great in this school because the environment is good and the class sizes are not overwhelming and the teachers and the principal (Dr. McQueen) actually care about the success of their students. 

My name is Phil Janvier i am a small business owner and when people told me i could not start my own business i said YES I CAN.  When people asked will i be able to support my family 5 children and a wife I said YES I WILL.

 I am sure when you told people that you wanted to be governor they probably said a woman, Wont Happen. But as i see through your example anything is possible and here you are the first female governor of North Carolina. Congratulations!! Now I ask myself  will i be able to make a difference with this Letter to the Goveronor?  The answer is your Governor Bev Perdue, yet i believe it will. 

Feel Free to Contact me at 919-758-5254  i would love to hear from you. More importantly i would like my son to continue his excellent intermediate education experience, and also would like for you to take a look at this current situation.  The name of the school again is

Torchlight Academy
3211 Bramer Drive
Raleigh, NC 27604
919-850-9960
Principal: Dr. Cynthia McQueen
Thank You in Advance.

P.s We only have until March 5 before the Board of Education make their decision.
Torchlight Academy has had over 2500 letters of support, Torchlight Academy has been on the radio and the news and observer, now the students, staff and supporters need your help Governor.. Thank You Again.

What will I do other than write this letter?  Governor I will donate 5% of my montly earnings in support of Torchlight Academy for 6mths out the year as i currently support another organization.  President Barack Obama said unquoted if we do our part in our community that he will back us. Seeing you on the same flyers during election season lets me know that you share his same sentiment.  

Please Governor excuse any Gramatical Errors in this letter as it was written unedited from my heart and not from a text book.  Thank you Again.

The Governor&#700;s Charlotte Office will be located on the second floor of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Government Center.  The 1,343 square foot space is at 600 East Fourth St.  If approved by the Charlotte City Council the lease will begin in March and move-in can begin shortly thereafter.



Governor Perdue Announces Library-Based "JobSearch Help Desk"

People hunting for jobs, filling out applications, and exploring educational opportunities are turning to the local library to do research at computer terminals. Librarians are busier than ever as they assist customers with internet searches.



The JobSearch Help Desk will train librarians to help patrons connect with employers and conduct job searches at public libraries. Partners in the project are the State Library at the Department of Cultural Resources, the Employment Security Commission, and the Department of Commerce.



Beginning in March, the State Library will conduct training sessions statewide for librarians.  The workshops will focus on use of North Carolina&#700;s statewide electronic database consortium NC LIVE plus print and online tools for job search skills, such as resume writing, job search, and interview resources.



When trained, librarians can help as "employment guides" with the ability to assess where the job seeker is in his or her job search process and direct the individual to the appropriate resources within the library and in their communities.



Each regional workshop will include panels with Employment Services Commission and Department of Commerce work force development professionals to share information on the related services and resources available.  Other elements of the workshop will include Internet resources, on-line databases such as NC LIVE, local and state job listings, and print materials. The workshops will be developed and presented by the State Library's Library Development consultants.



All Counties Now in Drought or Abnormally Dry

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced yesterday that for the first time since August, all 100 North Carolina counties are experiencing drought or abnormally dry conditions.



Abnormally dry conditions cover the entire eastern portion of North Carolina and parts of the Piedmont due to recent warm and dry weather. Conditions in western North Carolina, the state&#700;s driest area, worsened.  There are now 29 counties across the state in moderate drought and ten counties in the Hendersonville metropolitan area are facing severe drought.



There may not be any relief any time soon. Long-range outlooks from the National Climate Prediction Center show the possibility of unseasonably dry weather for several more months. Water conservation can help stretch the state&#700;s water resources for homeowners, businesses, agricultural users, and ecological interests.  The following are some water conservation tips:



For indoor water conservation, install a low-flow shower head; turn off water when brushing teeth; do only full loads of laundry; wash dishes by hand and repair leaking toilets.



For outdoor water conservation, water plants early in the day; plant only native grasses and shrubs; fix leaks in hose connections; use mulch to keep soil moist and collect and recycle rainwater.

120 New Jobs Coming to Forsyth County

This week Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC, a provider of aircraft maintenance services and sales, announced plans to expand its operations in Kernersville. The company plans to invest $5.8 million and create 120 jobs this year by relocating sister company Limco from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The announcement was made possible in part by a $44,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.



Piedmont Aviation Component Services&#700; roots stem from the 1940 creation of Piedmont Aviation in Winston-Salem, from which emerged Piedmont Airlines.  North Carolina has a growing aerospace sector, and Governor Perdue is excited to work with a homegrown company like Piedmont.

Hi Teri,

In the attachment, you will find my response regarding the SB 911 the Diabetes Care Bill and parental and student rights associated with it.  In addition, I have outlined the parent concerns and responded.
I also talked with the Associate Superintendent in Haywood County Schools, Dr. Bill Nolte, about this situation before preparing the response.
I did not mention his specific name in the response but used the generic "school personnel" term since I am hearing rumblings from another source that the parents might sue.  I also talked with the State School Nurse Consultant in DPH before preparing my comments and asked her not to share this information since I was unsure of confidentiality and such protocol.
I think it would be helpful to be able to notify the school nurse personnel in this situation.  Is that ok?

Let me know,
Paula

Subject: Early Childhood Education

Comment: Governor Purdue, Thank you for taking a stand for the education of North Carolina's most important asset - our children. I have a grandson who will start kindergarten this coming Fall and I desperately want him to receive the very best education possible. He is a very bright child and I don't want his potential to be wasted. It is and has always been my belief that one's education is only as good as the teacher @ the front of the classroom. Education has always been a priority in our home. We have one daughter who is a professor and another who is completing nursing school (this is the mom of our grandson). Please give me your honest opinion on the elementary schools in Robeson County. I am particularly interested in Tanglewood Elementary in Lumberton and Peterson Elementary in Red Springs. This is for our information only - I would never announce that "Governor Purdue said so". My daughter & family will be living in one of these two districts. Thank you for your help. I wish you the best in all your efforts to improve our great state and appreciate your commitment to our children from kindergarten through graduate school. Thank you again, Jean Wright

Subject: Assistance needed with local school system and diabetic child

Comment: My 8 yr old son is in need of your help. On January 5th 2008 JT was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. He was in the first grade. At the time of his diagnosis JT was required to take over 6 shots a day and check his blood sugar atleast 7 times a day. I (his mother) spent the better part of a month at the school to make sure that everyone was comfortable and trained as to how to properly take care of my son. In May of 2008 Jt's doctor along with my husband and myself felt that JT would benefit from being on an insulin pump. The insulin pump works similarly to a pancreas in that it gives a small dose of insulin every 3 mins. At that time I offered to train the ENTIRE school as to how to work the pump. I also contacted the company that manufactured the insulin pump, they were (and still are) willing to send their education team out to the school to train. The school nurse declined. Said that we would cross this bridge when we got closer to the new school year. The summer came and went. JT was doing great, he was in good control of his blood sugar, he was gaining back weight that had been lost earlier in the year, he was happy again for the first time in months, he was truly happy... and he wasn't scared that his blood sugar would prevent him from being able to do things. As the beginning of the school year approached, I contacted the school nurse numerous times... finally going down to the school the week before classes were to begin. We held a small training with only the 2 office staff, and at that time I was told that only the nurse would be allowed to do anything with the insulin pump. I said that it would be impossible for me to be at the school everyday so she needed to train the staff on the pump. I was assured that they would be. 3 weeks into the school year I requested that JT start testing his blood sugar in the office instead of the classroom. I was told at that time that they would make arrangements for him to be taken care of properly. By November 2008 JT was refusing to go to school, stating that he "Hated school", he started to refuse to do his homework, he became very disrespectful to everyone, including teachers. I requested a log of his blood sugars at school and found that his blood sugar was completely out of control. I started at that time to request that additional trainings take place. I received no reply. In early December my husband and I experienced the death of a close friend... his funeral was scheduled for the same day as a field trip for JT. I was told by his teacher that if I could not go on the field trip to take care of him that he probably wouldn't be able to go. I was furious. I immediately called the principal stating that he needed to make sure that the school nurse was there to take care of my child. I was told at that time that they would make sure that JT was taken care of on the field trip and that he would have a "1-on-1". I admit that I was completely skeptical of this and I sent JT on his field trip with my Blackberry programmed as to when he was to check his blood sugar, and eat. I was not going to take any chances on the student teacher assigned to him putting him in any danger. Later that week I went to the school for a party in JT's class, to help the teacher figure out how many carbs JT had consumed and calculate his insulin dosage for his insulin pump. At that time I was told by the school nurse "it's not in my contract to take care of a child on an insulin pump". At that moment, I realized that there was a complete disregard for my childs well being. I found out the next day that his A1C (a fancy blood test that gives you an average of what your blood sugars are daily, the lower the A1C the better you have control of your blood sugar 6 is average) was a 9.2. Up 2 whole points since the beginning of the school year. I called the superintendents office and spoke with Dr. Nolte, the assistant, and informed him that my child would not return to school until the staff was trained properly! I was not going to subject my child to a life filled with severe complications because the people who are charged with taking care of him everyday are not doing just that. I also at that time asked for a 504 plan. I was told that he did not qualify for a 504 plan because he did not have any mental handicaps. I still insisted on having one. I also spoke with the principal and told him that he needed to correct this immediately. In January there was a collaborative meeting put in place, where Dr. Nolte informed the school nurse that he wanted a step-by-step care plan in place for JT... He wanted to know exactly who was doing what, and when, and what to do if that person was not available. My husband and I were pleased. We felt as if the school was really going to work with us on this. Jt was absent the entire month of January (with the exception of 4 days) because of the school not furnishing the revised care plan. Once I received it I reviewed it and made notes as to what was wrong with it. and spoke with the school nurse to explain to her that this "new" plan was the same thing that was already in place. And I would not sign it. The school social worker was then sent to my house to try and coerce me to sign it. My husband clearly stated that neither of us would sign that form. Yesterday the social worker returned to my house with a Waynesville Police officer with the forms again. I was at a private school enrolling JT at this time, because my husband and I had decided that we had had enough of trying to work with Haywood County Public School. Jt's A1C this month was down to an 8.1... I was able to prove my point that him being in a situation where they did not know how to take care of him, was detrimental to his health. Today, this morning, the school social worker again came to my house with letters from the school principal stating that I would be charged with Medical Neglect for not signing the care plan. And that by me keeping him out of school I would be charged with academic neglect for all 3 of my children. As of this morning at 10am, none of my children are enrolled in Haywood County Public Schools, because of this. This is insane that a principal would go to such great lengths to not take care of a child. All I have asked for is for them to treat him according to his doctors orders. and this is impossible for them to do. I asked for a 504 plan on 2 separate occasions, and I was denied. Parent to parent, I am asking you to please intervene and make this right. It is not fair for my children to have to leave all of their friends because of 1 school refusing to step up to the plate and do what they are required by federal law to do. Thank you so much for your time and prompt attention to this matter, Amber Fuller

Dear Mr. Yost:



Thank you for your inquiry regarding public education in North Carolina.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue. 



The Governor is delighted her new Chief Executive of the State Board of Education, Dr. Bill Harrison, took the time to contribute insightful words of encouragement and support in response to your correspondence with him.  We also appreciate your taking time to share your thoughts and suggestions with our office.  Likewise, we are grateful for your advocacy, support and engagement in education in North Carolina (particularly via your focus on ¡°Reaching the Student¡¯s Mind by Reaching the Student¡¯s Heart¡±). 



You raise many valid points related to education in our state.  We agree with your thoughts that there must be competent and caring teachers in every classroom.  Indeed teachers play an integral role in attaining a higher level of educational excellence.  That is why the State Board of Education has adopted an agenda for ¡°Education for the 21st Century¡± that focuses on three important  concepts which directly align with many of your viewpoints:

¡õ        Rigor¡ªthe critical analysis of the content;

¡õ        Relevance¡ªthe connection to the content;

¡õ        Relationships¡ªthe engagement of students and adults in the learning environment.



In addition, you are correct; many students come to school with a multitude of issues that may directly affect their success in school.  This is a major reason why national, state and local education officials are re-emphasizing the importance of creating and implementing intervention strategies (such as outreach and mentoring programs) that are geared toward addressing the needs of this at-risk population.



Furthermore, regarding your suggestion about student¡¯s needing to communicate and think logically, our state officials have implemented the North Carolina Graduation Project.  The goals and objectives of this Project were designed based on a partnership of business leaders conducting discussions with leaders in education to let them know the characteristics and attributes they need to see in employees of the 21st century. It is a performance-based exit assessment that provides students with a vehicle to demonstrate their knowledge and skills as they prepare to graduate from high school. Through the graduation project process, students will engage various specific skills that include: computer knowledge, employability skills, information-retrieval skills, language skills ¨C reading, language skills ¨C writing, teamwork, and thinking/problem-solving skills. The NC Graduation Project consisting of four components (a research paper, product, portfolio, and an oral presentation) culminates in a student's final year of high school.  With regards to this, I'm sure you will value that the NC Graduation Project has been carefully planned in order to serve as an invaluable life-long learning experience for students.  You may also wish to visit:  <http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/graduationproject/>http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/graduationproject/ for additional information and a comprehensive review of the program elements.



Thank you again for taking the time to share your views with us.  We look forward to your continued work for education in North Carolina.



                                                                                                Sincerely,



Kristi D. Tally

Subject: Reaching the Student¡¯s Mind by Reaching the Student¡¯s Heart

Comment: ¡°Thanks, Randy. You have some great stories to share that demonstrate the important role adults play in the lives of young people. You also had some great advice given to you from mentors throughout your career that you took to heart. I appreciate your sharing¡± (Bill Harrison, Chief Executive of North Carolina¡¯s K-12 System and Chairman of the State Board of Education). After Mr. Harrison read what I wrote below, I received this (the above) from him on 2/18/09. I thought you might be interested in reading it. Randy _________________________________________ Reaching the Student¡¯s Mind by Reaching the Student¡¯s Heart by Randy Yost "The nature of the work of teachers has changed dramatically from my time as a student, to my time as a teacher, to my time as a principal, to my time as a superintendent, and it will continue to change. However, as the way we do our work changes, the one constant that has remained from my time as a student until today, and will always remain, is student success comes down to a competent, caring teacher in the classroom. "Every time I visit a classroom, no matter what the grade or subject, my belief is reinforced. Teachers make the difference. Children come to us in all shapes and sizes, from all types of backgrounds. I recognize teachers are enriching their lives in ways those outside of the school may never know. When I think back to my days in the public schools of Pennsylvania, there is much I do not remember. What I do remember are the names of the teachers I had and how they shaped my life." (Bill Harrison, Chief Executive of North Carolina¡¯s K-12 System and Chairman of the State Board of Education) I will never forget one of my high school juniors, a 16 year-old male student. I was teaching English, and he came in late for my class. When I asked him why he was tardy, he could not tell me because he was crying---right in front of about 30 other students. After he sat down, I walked to his desk and asked him what was wrong. ¡°Mr. Yost, my mother died when I was 5. Now my father has cancer,¡± he said. After my heart fell to my stomach, I told the students to answer the questions at the end of Thoreau¡¯s ¡°From Walden.¡± (I was teaching Thoreau¡¯s ¡°From Walden.¡±) Unlike the other students who began working, this student did not begin working. Instead, again, he was crying. I wrote some words on a piece of paper. Then I handed the paper to him. Although he did not stop crying, he stopped crying aloud. While I stood behind the podium and stared at this student, I thought about another junior, a 17-year old female student, who walked up to me one day while I was teaching. I stopped teaching and asked her what was wrong. She started crying and said she was upset because one of her girlfriends had sex with her father (the father of the girl who was crying). She asked me if she could go to the bathroom. I told another female student to go with her. While I was thinking about this student, the bell rang and the students left the room. Then I sat at my desk and thought about another high school student, a ¡°hard core¡± student, who told me the following: ¡°Mr. Yost, I have never seen my parents. Both of them are in prison. I have lived from foster home to foster home.¡± As I thought about this student¡¯s life, I said to myself, ¡°No wonder this student is ¡®hard core¡¯.¡± I have worked as a public school educator for almost 20 years. Today I work as the coordinator of a public school¡¯s intervention center. We serve 5 different schools: a high school, a middle school, and three elementary schools. I work with principals, several assistant principals, and MANY teachers. I also work with school counselors and parents. I receive on average about 20 e-mails per day, and the telephone rings on average about 15 times per day. Although I no longer teach in the classroom or give grades, I still work with students as a ¡°counselor¡± and a ¡°tutor.¡± Therefore, I continue to experience similar stories---like the ones I shared that I heard from students while teaching in the classroom for many years. For example, recently I had a female middle school student who lives at a group home and a male high school student who lives at a different group home. One day at the Intervention Center the female student cut herself and stuck a pencil eraser in her ear, so I had to call the middle school and tell them she was trying to hurt herself. Due to her continual unhappiness and so her self-inflicted wounds, she was placed in a state hospital. On a different day at the Intervention Center, the male student told me repeatedly that he wanted to go home; and he asked me a couple times to talk with his lawyer about getting him out of his group home. When he found out that his parents said he had to stay in the group home, one night at the group home he shut the door to his room, lay on his bed, and set his blanket on fire: he wanted to burn up his room, thus killing himself. He came back to the Intervention Center about two weeks later; and then three weeks after returning, I called the group home one morning because he did not come to the Intervention Center that morning. That afternoon one of the counselors from the group home came to see me, and he told me that this student would not be back because he tried to kill himself by hanging himself. On my way home that afternoon, I called his dad and talked with him for several minutes. He said his son was placed in a state hospital. Then there are the students who tell me that they have not seen their mom or dad in several months, since they are living with one parent and their parents will not even speak to each other. Recently, for example, I had to call a school counselor about a 14 year-old female student who would NOT stop crying: she was emotionally shipwrecked due to her mother¡¯s hatred and her father¡¯s hatred for each other, a hatred for each other that started after the father had an affair with (and moved in with) his mother-in-law (this girl¡¯s grandmother or this girl¡¯s mother¡¯s mom). The counselor had to take this student to her office, and the last thing I heard is that this student is still emotionally shipwrecked. These true stories clearly show that many young people are really hurting. Many young people have in-depth emotional problems (heart problems), and one can see why. In fact, due to their widespread heart problems, I am convinced that ESPECIALLY TODAY educators must reach the student¡¯s heart IF we are going to reach the student¡¯s mind. (I have talked with MANY educators who feel the same way---that we must reach the student¡¯s heart IF we are going to reach the student¡¯s mind.) Do not misunderstand me: students need to learn English, math, science, history, etc; and I promote this because I am a public school educator---a North Carolina certified teacher with a M.A. degree also. Further, I write and read DAILY. I am also a strong advocate of reading, writing, and discussing in order to grow intellectually and socially. Also, I believe every student should know how to communicate and how to think (to reason logically) in writing and orally before they graduate from high school. Also, do not misunderstand me: I know that disrespect and laziness are NOT to be tolerated---period. In other words, in writing this paper I am NOT advocating that educators should allow their students to be disrespectful or lazy in light of their plight. I am absolutely NOT saying (promoting) this! In fact, those who know me know that I implement ¡°tough love¡± whenever (not if) it is necessary. This, too, is why four years ago the principal of the high school who was in charge of the intervention center agreed to move me out of the classroom to work as the coordinator of the intervention center---that is, as he saw me teach in the classroom and as we talked about it four years ago, he knew that I employ ¡°tough love¡± whenever it is necessary. (Since I helped my wife raise a daughter [who is now grown], and since my wife and I are now raising our teenage son, I know that at times young people need [and they really want] ¡°tough love.¡±) Still, I also know from experience that ESPECIALLY TODAY¡¯S typical students have a lot of heart-felt issues due to the kinds of experiences I have shared. Therefore without any intervention, they could care less about knowing, for example, the difference between an adverb and an adjective---that an adverb modifies a verb, adverb, or an adjective while an adjective modifies a noun or pronoun. In fact, their heartfelt issues make learning grammatical issues a real ¡°issue¡± with them. Without any intervention, these students could care less about knowing, for instance, the difference between the perimeter and the area of a geometric figure, such as a rectangular. Instead, the size of the pain in their hearts makes the size of geometric figures unimportant in comparison. Without any intervention, these students could care less about knowing, for example, the difference between the First Law of Thermodynamics and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Their dynamite problems prevent them from seeing the ¡°dynamics¡± of the Laws of Thermodynamics. Without any intervention, these students could care less about knowing, for instance, the difference between the Legislative Branch (law making branch) and the Executive Branch of the United States Government, or that the Executive Branch executes (carries out, not makes) the laws that have been legislated by the Legislative Branch. Their heart-felt problems have been ¡°executed¡± so they shun that which has anything to do with having ¡°laws.¡± Although, again, students need to know these academic things and students need to respect their teachers and not be lazy, today¡¯s typical middle school and high school students, such as the ones I describe above, could care less about knowing these things. Instead, they want to know (even if their ¡°want to¡± is subconsciously) that educators care about them---their problems---or that we perceive them as human beings as such and not just as students per se. My experience, in fact, confirms that we will not teach today¡¯s typical students (or reach their minds) until we first reach their hearts by letting them know that we care about them and hence that they are human beings as such. So in order to reach the minds of students, how can we reach their hearts by letting them know that we care about them (their problems) and thus that they are human beings as such? What is the intervention? First, we must befriend students. About 20 years ago, a wise high school principal told me the following: ¡°Randy, you cannot be a student¡¯s pal; but you can and must be a student¡¯s friend. Being a student¡¯s pal does not allow you to maintain the teacher-student relationship (hierarchy) that is imperative for success in the academic realm, but being a student¡¯s friend allows and enables success in the academic realm.¡± My 20 years of experience confirm that he is correct. Befriending students, which requires talking with students as a friend (as we do with other friends), lets them know that we care about them and/or that we care about their problems---that they are human beings first and students second. That is, not only must it be that it is students first and then athletes second---that they are student-athletes and not athlete-students---but also it must be that they are human beings first and students second. In other words, again, students must know that we care about their problems, their heartaches, their difficulties, their sorrows---that we do NOT look beyond these human being-related experiences because we see them as only students. Instead, again, we must talk with them as a friend also in order for them to perceive that we deem them as human beings first and students second. This means that neither do we talk ¡°down to them¡± as though they are second-rate because ¡°they are the student and we are the teacher.¡± Once they know that we care about them as human beings as such, or that we are their friends, then we will have access to their minds because we have obtained access to their hearts. Here is the principle: since young people are human beings also, the clich¨¦ that people do not care about how much you know until they know how much you care applies to them too. I mean, we must befriend them and hence show them that we care about them (reaching their hearts) as human beings first before we show them what they can and need to know as students (reaching their minds). Second, Zig Ziglar has always been one of my favorite motivational speakers. I am a stalwart believer and promoter of one of his prominent sayings: People were "designed for accomplishment, engineered for success, and endowed with the seeds of greatness." As Ziglar believes, since human beings were designed, human beings have a Designer; and as Ziglar believes (his office e-mailed me and confirmed this), the Designer is God (This is NOT a reference to religion as such) who designed humankind to be successful and, therefore, endowed human beings with the seeds (ability/talent) to do great things. In other words, every student is a human being, so God has designed every student to succeed since God designed every human being to succeed (Again, this is NOT a reference to religion as such). Frankly, our belief in this makes the first thing a lot easier: if we believe that God designed human beings with the ability to succeed and students are human beings who thus have been designed by God with the ability to succeed, it will not be difficult to befriend every student as a human being as such due to the parity that exists between students and us---the God-given ability for humanity (all of us) to succeed. If young people know (and if we know) that they are wonderfully designed because, as Ziglar believes, they came from (were designed from) the Designer God, they will know that they have intrinsic value in just being created as a human being. Rick Warren, the author of the book Purpose Driven Life and the person who PRAYED at PRESIDENT OBAMA's Inauguration because PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED him to pray, says the following about human beings: "God is more interested in what I am than in what I do. That's why we are called human beings, not human doings." In other words, the emphasis must be on the "being" (a human being) and not on the "doing"---a student doing math work, doing English work, doing science work, doing history work, etc. The truism that young people are human beings foremost with inherent value will nurture the doing as students, since the "doing" is the result of the "being" (human beings). Their social behavior will be affected also because what is manifested outwardly comes from what exists inwardly, as output is based on input. Alas! When will we see the significance of young people perceiving themselves with intrinsic value in being created (designed) by God to succeed?!? Again and again, this is not a reference to religion as such. Just ask President Obama, who publicly says he believes in God and thus asked Minister Rick Warren to pray at his Inauguration! Not only am I failing to advocate religion as such, but also neither am I promoting that educators of any religion ¡°witness¡± to students in the public school classroom because this is deemed illegal by the government. Although it is legal to teach about religion in the public school classroom, it is not legal to teach in religion: ¡°To teach about religion is not to instruct in religion. Teaching about religion embraces the study of various religions¡­.Instruction in religion, by contrast, is to seek acceptance of and commitment to a particular religion¡± [California Department of Education]. In other words, public school educators of any religion should not evangelize in the classroom, ¡°witnessing¡± to students. This is not legally permitted. Anyway, many young people have in-depth emotional problems (heart problems). Due to their widespread heart problems, I am convinced that ESPECIALLY TODAY educators must reach the student¡¯s heart IF we are going to reach the student¡¯s mind. That is, we must intervene and befriend them as human beings first and students second. Of course, again and again, this does NOT mean that we condone disrespect and laziness. We must also intervene and reflect that they have been designed to succeed and to do great things. I know MANY educators who REALLY CARE about their students, and many of these have told me that they agree with what I have written. I respect the many educators who have told me this; and I respect the many other educators who likewise believe what Bill Harrison, Chief Executive of North Carolina¡¯s K-12 System, says: ¡°Student success comes down to a competent, caring teacher in the classroom¡­.Teachers make the difference.¡±

Subject: Future Ready High School requirements for graduation

Comment: Governor Purdue, In a faculty meeting this morning we were given the "Future Ready" graduation requirements for students that are currently in 8th grade. All current 8th graders will have to pass Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II to get a diploma. Without successfully completing these courses they will only receive a certificate. I am so concerned about my 8th grade math students who won't be able to meet this requirement that I wanted to contact you. Many students just cannot grasp the concepts of high school level geometry or algebra. Several years ago I had student that tried for years she to retake the math competency exam, an 8th grade level math graduation required that's now obsolete. She wanted a diploma so badly that she tried over and over to pass the test each year she remained eligible, even after she was out of school. She finally aged out. Her only reward for her effort was a certificate of attendance. No amount of remediation could help her to pass this test. She did come close to passing several times. My standards for student achievement are high. Both of my own children graduated from high school at NCSSM (North Carolina School of Science and Math), Wake Forest University and Duke University respectively. Some children just don't have the natural ability, persistence, added with the motivation to achieve at an academic level required for some math courses. Are we creating a no win situation, separating the haves from the have nots, or setting students up for frustration and failure? Are educators or politicians setting the standards? I believe we should set standards high but in an achievable level.

<mailto:teri.riddle@nc.gov>Dear Mr. Whitaker:



Thank you for your correspondence regarding the NC Learn and Earn Initiative.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue.



The NC General Assembly established Learn and Earn high schools as public schools, located on campuses of colleges and universities.  These high schools adhere to the same funding formulas as other  public schools in the state. Learn and Earn Online is offered at every public high school in the state. The legislators have determined that these opportunities are for students attending public schools in North Carolina.



 I will share your feedback regarding the integration of private school students with others as we look to continually improve educational opportunities for students.
