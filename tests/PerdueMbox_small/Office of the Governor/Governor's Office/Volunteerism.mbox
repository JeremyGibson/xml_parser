Dear Mr. Barros,



Thank you for writing and your interest in volunteering.  I have shared your name with staff at Communities in Schools of North Carolina.  This organization recruits volunteers to serve as mentors in our public schools.  They match mentors with students that need assistance.  Communities in Schools of North Carolina has a program in Clay County which is looking to serve children in Cherokee County.  Theresa Waldroup, the Executive Director, will be contacting you shortly.  You may have already received correspondence from her.  Her contact information is:
