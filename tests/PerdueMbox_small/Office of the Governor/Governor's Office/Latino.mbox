Dear Mr. Gallo,



We appreciate your sharing of information about the services that your two companies provide for multi-lingual health information and video interpretation services. Since our office personnel are bilingual we don’t need your services at this time. You may want to explore if other state government agencies may have a need for your services. For ZonaMed you may want to contact the North Carolina Department of Health & Human Services and for ZonaLaw you may consider the North Carolina Department of Justice.

Regards,

Comment: I am writing to you in hopes that our two companies ZonaMed and ZonaLaw may in some way help improve the status of communicating with foreign immigrants especially the Hispanic community. Both corporations are proudly based in North Carolina, but the services are offered worldwide. ZonaMed and ZonaLaw were established after extensive research on the shortage of services for the ever growing Spanish population. ZonaMed is a multi-lingual health information and video interpretation website. ZonaLaw is a multi-lingual video interpretation website targeting attorneys, state and local government, law enforcement agencies and insurance companies. Both companies are innovative in establishing a forum for people of different languages to easily communicate with one another using our online state-of-art video interpretation service. This service can be beneficial for all state and government offices pertaining either to health, law enforcement, emergency services, judicial branches, and all social service agencies. This service is offered in a very cost effective form. The user of this service does not require to purchase special equipment, pay for set-up fees, or pay monthly maintenance fees. The user need only to have access to a computer with internet connection capabilities. At this time, I would be honored to meet with you or one of your staff members, in order to have the opportunity to further explain how ZonaMed or ZonaLaw can be beneficial to all branches of government in dealing with the problematic language barrier. Please feel free to visit our website at www.zonamed.com or www.zonalaw.com. If you wish to speak with me further you may contact me either by phone at 919-601-3051 or via email at egallo@zonamed.com. Thank you. Regards, Ernest Gallo President/CEO ZonaMed/ZonaLaw
