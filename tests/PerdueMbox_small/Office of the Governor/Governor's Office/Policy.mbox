Subject: Request for Infrastructure Project Listing



To Whom it May Concern:



In October a request was sent to our organization from the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) to submit a listing of potential and shovel ready regional infrastructure projects to be submitted to The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to examine the best way to direct regional infrastructure investments. 



It is my understanding that the Governor’s office submitted a similar list through the National Governors Association for the State of North Carolina.  



We would like to receive a copy of that listing. 



Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.

Dear Governor Easley,

First of all, I can't believe that immigration is not a subject in your drop down menu!?!

I can't believe what I read on the front page of the News and Observer today (7/30/08), "Library arrest roils county". We're deporting someone back to Mexico who hasnt' lived there since she was 3?!? She was a cheerleader, honor student, librarian and young mother? Quick, let's get her off the streets and back to Mexico, where she's practically never lived.



Does anyone pay attention to the business school reports that say NC and this country cannot afford to deport all illegal immigrants either in terms of man hours, court costs and biggest of all, loss of labor? When will the witch-hunt end!?! We are a nation of immigrants - mine came from Sweden and England, where did the rest of us come from?



Why don't we focus on something really harmful, like the 80,000 jobs lost to China from North Carolina, also reported in the same newspaper edition. This is what is really effecting my friends and family! Cisco employees are getting pulled off of projects that are being shipped over seas and Marxavi Angel Martinez is our biggest worry!?!



Sincerely,
Kirsten Gardner

Mr. Easley:

I am a Hispanic American born in Austin, Texas. I served in the United States Air Force and holder of Four Degrees. The Degrees include a MBA, BA, AAS, and USAF Diploma.

In the last couple of years the native North Carolinians complain with our illegal immigration problem. Though I am not happy paying for illegal immigrant’s children to go to school or healthcare, it is the right thing to do. But one thing must be noted, people in North Carolina associate immigration with Mexicans, which is completely wrong. My child is often stereotyped at school and letters are sent home, in Spanish, for me to read. Well I do not speak Spanish nor do I read Spanish. We must also note that “Mexicans” are often uneducated, hardworking, and take jobs that other people do not want.

With that said, the problem is with the H1 Visas in North Carolina. I have five Colleagues that are currently working in North Carolina and have H-1 Visas. They are all from Canada and make over 70,000 per year. One would argue that the reason for the H-1 Visa is due to the lack of skilled works in the United States. However, most of the H-1 Visas are for jobs not requiring a high level of difficulty such as: Computer Sales, Computer Technicians, and Computer support. With the current rate of employment, you cannot tell me that Americans can’t perform the same job.

I am a Civil Engineer and was currently laid-off. With the unemployment rate as high as it is, why doesn't North Carolina or the Federal Government revoke all of these Visas to leave the higher paying jobs for our own country?

Well, since he’s demanding.  What he is referring to is a recommendation of the 21st Century Transportation Committee.  Here is the address of the committee website:  http://www.ncleg.net/documentsites/committees/21stCenturyTransportation/Homepage/ 



All the information he would like is available there, including the contact information of the legislators on the committee, and the final report and recommendation.  Here’s the recommendation he wants information about:



Vehicle Miles Traveled {VMT} Fee. The Committee recognizes the State needs an

alternative or supplement to the motor fuels tax. This fee would be a true user-fee

independent of type or amount of fuel consumed. These days, North Carolinians are

traveling more miles in more vehicles. However, our roadways are suffering from lack of

maintenance and new construction due to the slow growth of motor fuels tax revenues

due to improvements in fuel economy One possible solution is to base our tax on how

much we drive, not how much fuel we consume – in other words, a “Vehicle Miles

Traveled Fee” (VMT Fee). With the VMT fee the consumers would pay taxes

proportionately to the number of miles they drive. There is a pilot project in Oregon that

is testing the feasibility of a VMT fee. A simple approach to a VMT fee is to charge each

passenger vehicle and truck 1/4 cent for each mile driven. The average driver drives

12,000 miles per year, so with an exemption for the first 2000 miles the cost to the

average driver would be $25. This fee could be collected as a part of the vehicle annual

inspection program. In addition, the General Assembly should consider authorizing a

local option VMT fee.



It’s important to note this was not even a recommendation of a committee who’s job it was to make recommendation regarding the nature of funding of the NC road system.  It was not a recommendation of the general assembly, the Governor, nor any specific legislator.  Additionally, the draft legislation that was part of the final report of the committee AND the legislation that was introduced in both houses as the recommendation of the committee DID NOT HAVE THIS PROVISION. 



The VMT is “one possible solution” proposed by the committee, but it is not one recommended by the committee.  It is always possible a legislator may introduce this as legislation before the bill filling deadline, but at present this isn’t even pending legislation.

Subject: health care reform summit in gso

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would be very interested in being at the health care reform summit in greensboro, that i saw in the news today. I have a special insight. I am a nurse, with a master's degree and 30 years experience. Due to some really bizarre situations, i found myself without health insurace for a long time. I have medicare now, through disability. I had to be my own advocate and take on a persona that is not my normal self, to fight, and I mean fight the system in numerous ways. I could give you a list of ridiculous things told to me during this time. I have been told that they don't usually have patients like me, where i have my internists office, which is sad. Anyway, my years as an advanced practice nurse in oncology and experience in healthcare as it has chaged during the years, was no match for what i have had to go through, just to get adequate basic healthcare, not to mention things like dental and other things. I am, of course just one of millions, unfortunatley. I just have a voice, with knowledge and experience behind it. Recently a dr. gave me a lecture on what an internist was, apparently not realizing my background. I called the director of the clinic to inform him and to tell that i had checked with medicare and for the dr. to call the provider line. And that is just a small example of what patients can go through. Anyway, i would very much like to be involved, from my professional experience and the very personal one. I had e-mailed the change. gov website, after it was up-i got an e-mail from john podesta saying to look at president elect-then obama's plan. If you could assist with this, i would be grateful. Is it to be an open meeting etc.? Thank you very much.

Subject: Greensboro Health Care Forum

Comment: I would like to know more about the health care forum set for Greensboro on March 31. Ideally, I would like to attend as a guest, if possible. Also, I believe the Governor's office should promote this meeting loudly over the next few weeks. Health care reform is critical. Thanks.

Subject: Regional Health Reform Discussion

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would love to be involved in the Regional Health Reform Discussion. I have been a registered nurse for almost 20 years. I am also the administrative director for surgical services department at FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital here in Pinehurst, NC. My background is both surgical and health care information technology. I am concerned by statments about the electronic medical record being the cure for all our health care issues. I can tell you it is not. I would welcome the opportunites to share my views and listen to others at the Regional Health Reform Discussion. Tom Kane, RN

Dear Mr. Gilfus:



Thank you for your inquiry about the Military Advisory in Governor Perdue’s Office.  We very much appreciate your interest.



Governor Perdue has not named a new Military Advisor to date, but as you may be aware she is very supportive of the military and the military community, including their families and communities and the businesses and companies that work with DOD and the defense industry.  She has indicated her strong interest in creating jobs for North Carolinians in the aerospace and defense industries and continuing to make NC military friendly. 



At the present time I am assisting the Governor’s Office on military issues in general and would be happy to assist you.   



You may contact me by email or at the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you.



Ann Lichtner
