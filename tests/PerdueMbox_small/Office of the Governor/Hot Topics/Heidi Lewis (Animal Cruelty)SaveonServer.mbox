I am a member of a national animal rescue group and was sent the below information. I find this very disturbing. While I realize all animals can not be saved, but cruelty while put an animal down is just unacceptable in my eyes. These animals need compassion.

This occurred at the Wake County Animal Shelter (right in your back door).

Episode w/Heidi:
 Thought you should know that
>   Heidi Lewis at WCAS, the weekend manager for receiving,  got suspended
>   (we all expect she will be fired) for cruelty to animals while
>   euthanizing. Many of us  warned Tommy Esqueda and Michael Williams
>   about her, but they made her manager anyway. She is accused of doing heart
>   stick euthanasia without sedation AND she crushed a dog ¢ s trachea
>   while he gasped for air.  I ¢ m very upset about what is going on out there. This is the 2 nd time in
>   the last year that something like this has happened.  Latoria was let go
>   for improperly euthanizing kittens.  They need someone else in there
>   managing that place that knows how to run a shelter and properly
>   euthanize.

Episode with Victor:
 While cleaning a cage full of small puppies, Victor washed one of them down the disposal grate and he drowned in the grate 2 cages down.

To the Honorable Governor Easley:

I was horrified to learn of the appalling, cruel, and malicious practices at the Raleigh NC animal shelter. That it has taken so long to finally cause government to take action shows an equally disturbing disregard for the innocent animals that come into the shelter by those officials to whom complaints were made time and time again.When did the word "shelter" change its definition to "NC Animal Auschwitz?"

What kind of animals have WE become to show such total indifference to the agony of animals who, through no fault of their own, wind up in an animal shelter and most likely will be put to sleep because there are just too many of them?  Would anyone let their own child slip down a drainage pipe and slowly drown? It has been documented time and again that our treatment of animals provide valuable clues to our latent behavior with respect to human society.

There is no question that being responsible for managing animal populations in area shelters is a difficult job emotionally as well as physically. Turnover at shelters is relatively high, when compared to other types of jobs. But surely we can find kinder, gentler people to treat our often callously discarded pets more humanely.

Please, when you find replacements for those responsible for these horrific treatments, administer a psychological examination, in addition to an I.Q. test and thorough background check.

Thank you for reading this to the end.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Congratulations on your win.  I wish you nothing but the best and know you will do what is best for the citizens of North Carolina.

Please add this item to your very busy list.  The Wake County Animal Shelter has employees that are performing acts of cruelty on its innocent wards - the animals.

Please investigate this and help put a stop to the cruelty.  Animals already suffer at the hands of other people.  Even if they are bound for death at the shelter, they should still be treated with kindness right up to the very last breath.

Re:  Recent Animal Cruelty Investigation - Wake Animal Care & Control

Gentlemen:

It has come to my attention that animal cruelty in the Euthanasia Room of Wake County Animal Care & Adoption facility appears to be taking place. 

I received an email from a volunteer sent to myself (former volunteer and animal advocate) and another former volunteer.

This email appeared to have been a copy from a shelter attendant that was sent to the volunteer.  I consider this email a plea for help.

The email stated that Heidi Lewis, was seen crushing a dog's trachea to kill it.  The shelter attendant told her to stop and she continued killing the dog in this manner.  I have also "heard" and it seems to be documented, that unsedated heart stick euthanasia is or has been recently performed at this facility.

I also "heard" that the shelter director, Michael Williams, scolded the shelter attendant for "going above his head" with the complaint.  I have "heard" that the shelter attendant went to a vet on duty to report the incident.

I "heard" that Heidi Lewis has been "suspended." 

Who is doing the killing now?  Who is overseeing that Euthanasia Room?

I have "heard" and you need to open this up for the public please: that "Latoria," who I clearly remember working there, was "fired" "for improperly euthanizing cats and kittens."

I am in shock.  I am sick.  I am truly alarmed at the conditions taking place in North Carolina animal shelters.  Remember what I wrote you about Gaston County?  Today I write you about Wake County animal abuses.

I wrote you about many shelters.  I was given the shaft...the da dee da...Strange that Gaston Animal Shelter, run by President of the NC Rabies Association, Reggie Horton,  was also recently in the news for animal cruelty.  Somehow the Gaston Vet Tech College did not make the news.  Weren't they in a "fellowship" with Ralph Houser, Reggie Horton, and the NC Dept of Agriculture (turning its head the other way), in the use of Gaston shelter animals being used for "vet tech students to work on?"  Did you not receive my emails about this situation?  Did I, and many others not inform you about the cement room the vet tech used animals were forced to live in during the time they were used for "teaching models?"  Were you not asked by myself and others for records of the procedures to be pulled, and how they were being fed, watered, and offered ambient temperatures in the cement room?

Please reply.  What do you intend to do about the Euthanasia Rooms  in this state (without video cameras) monitoring euthanasia?  Who is minding the welfare of forced to die homeless animals?

Please reply.  What do you intend to do about the crushed tracheas of the dead dogs at Wake Shelter.  Are you going to send Wake Animal Control officers inside its own facility to investigate?

What will you do?  I need to know.  I am part of the taxpaying public putting peanut butter and eggs on your table.

Awaiting an immediate response.

Re:  Wake County Animal Care & Control


Please investigate the alleged killing of a puppy that was hosed down a disposal pipe and found dead two cages away by shelter attendant "Victor."  I received this information in an email, too.  Why were pups in the cage when it was being hosed?  Why?  You tell me why!

Governor Perdue,

I would ask that you please do something about this situation. This woman needs to go to jail because of animal cruelty. Not only has she done this before, but she is at this shelter once again torturing those creatures which have done nothing, except be born to this earth.

We have to keep in mind that these dogs, cats and other creatures have done nothing to us. They are not a mistake that God made when he created this earth. He loves his creatures, and they do belong to him, and him only. So these creatures should be given protection from us.

Ms. Lewis feels that these innocent creatures should die a horrible death. That they are not worth much, otherwise why would she be free to kill them. This kind of thinking has to stop, and Ms. Lewis needs to stand trial for animal cruelty. Without this people will continue to torture and kill these innocent creatures. Creatures that were supposed to be cared for by us, but live on this earth mostly tortured their entire lives. It is time to stop and and I hope you will be one of those who says, enough is enough!

Please see that Ms. Lewis is charged with animal cruelty and then goes to trial. I would hope that the people of Raleigh, NC will stand up against these injustices and DO THE RIGHT THING!

Thank you.
