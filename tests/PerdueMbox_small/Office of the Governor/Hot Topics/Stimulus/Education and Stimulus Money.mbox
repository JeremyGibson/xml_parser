Subject: Education and Stimulus Funds

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, I am deeply concerned about North Carolina’s teachers losing their jobs regardless of North Carolina receiving substantial stimulus funds from the federal government. Our teachers and children are an invaluable resource that should not be compromised even during challenging times. Education is a matter of national security, and increasing the teacher to student ratio in order to save funds on teachers' salaries is appalling. I have complete confidence in your ability to continue fighting to place education first in North Carolina. Thank you, Charity Bailey
