Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

It's important to crack down on dog fighting.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

It's important to crack down on dog fighting.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

Dog fighting is abuse! Please do what you can to help
authorities crack down on this awful crime!

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel

This issue is so important to me. It is a horrific act that

incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

These actions must be stopped now! Not only is this causing a

dogs in danger. Why would this be allowed to continue in a
society that seems to be so compassionate. To think what happens
to these dogs, is horrible. Think for a minute....what if this
was your dog, it was stolen from your front yard, you never knew
what happened to him, but all along he was being used to
fight.......or as bait. Totally not cool......please put an end
to this!!!!
