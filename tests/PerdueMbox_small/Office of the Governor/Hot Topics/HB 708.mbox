I am opposed to House Bill 708 that will allow up to 20 days a year of unpaid mandatory furloughs for state employees making more than $30,000 annually.  You are dealing with dedicated employees who take pride in their jobs of supporting a school system in ways to ensure that students are educated. This bill would definitely be a hardship for the state's working families. I am asking that you support our state employees and look at other ways of cutting the budget.
Thank you,
Judy Burris

Please vote NO to House Bill 708.  No Furloughs! I was willing to give up my longevity payment, but this is too much.  Please vote NO.

Dear Elected Officials:

I realize these are tough times for the state budget and you all are working hard to minimize the impact to state employees.  The suggested furlough of up to 20 days for some state employees would place a hardship on the work done by my department.  It's all I can do to get my work done and have buses running smoothly in 12 months.  To reduce my work time by one month (which in my case would most likely be during the summer when school is not in session) severely inhibits the planning time needed to prepare bus routes for the upcoming school year. 

With economic factors restricting family incomes, more families will be looking to public school bus transportation for their children to attend school.

I certainly hope that you will reconsider the elements of this bill.
