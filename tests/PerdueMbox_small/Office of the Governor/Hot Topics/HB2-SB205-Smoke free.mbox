Governor Bev Perdue
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0301

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing today to ask you to work for a comprehensive
smokefree law for North Carolina. No one in North Carolina
should have to be exposed to toxic secondhand smoke as a
condition of employment.

Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease in healthy
nonsmokers. Almost 50,000 non-smoking Americans die from
secondhand smoke each year. The primary source of secondhand
smoke exposure for adult non-smokers is the workplace.

Please make North Carolina smokefree. A smokefree community:

*protects all workers and patrons from the dangers of secondhand
smoke. People should not have to risk their lives through
exposure to secondhand smoke in order to make a living.

*reduces the death and disease associated with secondhand smoke.

*motivates smokers to quit.

*reduces the number of people who start smoking.

Support the American Lung Association?s SmokefreeAir Challenge
and join the 23 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico
that all have approved comprehensive smokefree air legislation.

Please protect the health of all workers in North Carolina. Vote
for a comprehensive smokefree workplace law.




Sincerely,
Warren Pace
