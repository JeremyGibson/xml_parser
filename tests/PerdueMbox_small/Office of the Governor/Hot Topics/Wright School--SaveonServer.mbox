Comment: Would like to let Governor Perdue know how important Wright School is to this state as well as to our special needs children and that closing it will it turn cost the state more money and special needs kids with no place to go. If it wasnt for this school my son would probably be in an institution founded by the state, now my son is showing great gains and hopefully one day contribute back to society. Please rethink there closing.

Subject: NC DHHS Budget / The Wright School

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, My daughter, Mackenna, attended the Wright School for 7 months in 2007. We had been dealing with her mental health issues with only minimal success for over five years prior to this. We had tried many different psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and programs. The Wright School helped my daughter more than any of these other people or programs -- and they had the deck stacked against them at the time because my younger daughter Colleen, Mackenna's, younger sister, was dying with cancer. Despite this horrible family medical situation the Wright school made far more progress -- lasting progress -- with Mackenna. We have been out of Wright School for six months, but we are still enjoying the benefits of this progress as Mackenna is doing well at Durant Middle School, both socially and acedemically. She is playing team sports for the first time in her life. She is just functioning on a new level. We can't thank the wonderful people at the Wright School enough. I am personally willing to contribute money or time if that in any way will help keep the Wright School open. Please let me know if there is anything I can personally do to help influence the budget decisions in the Wright School's favor. Sincerely, James V. Moore, III

Subject: Possibility of closing Wright and Whitaker Schools

Comment: It has come to my attention that closing Wright School in Durham and Whitaker School in Butner are listed as possible money-saving options on the table for North Carolina. While I certainly appreciate the necessity to slash costs during these devastating times, I also understand the critical place these Schools have in the lives of families with troubled children. One of those children attends my church, and I know first-hand how important the Wright School program is for this family. At present, there are NO OTHER options ("community settings") in Durham County for emotionally disturbed children. These children cannot be mainstreamed in most cases, and attempts to do so would be potentially dangerous for them and for the community. I urge you to reconsider closing Wright and/or Whitaker as an option for cutting costs. There has to be another way.

Re: Proposed N.C. Budget Cuts in DHR: Whitaker School and Wright School


Dear Governor Perdue:

I am writing this letter to express disappointment and opposition to the proposed budget cuts that would result in the closing of both the Whitaker School and the Wright School.† These two programs currently serve some of the most emotionally disturbed, at-risk students in the state.† It would be extremely concerning for both humanitarian and fiscal reasons for these services to be cut.† Many of the children in these programs have been abused, neglected, and are without any social support or structure in their lives. If anything, these types of programs need more funding.† These facilities are designed to prevent future problems by intervening with current problems.† As you know, mental health care services in North Carolina are currently deplorable, and many people who require such services are ending up in our prisons, emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and morgues, resulting in both increasing long-term human misery and monetary costs.† These two programs provide services that our state should feel obligated to provide its youth.

Our school system has had a number of students who benefited from treatment from the Wright and Whitaker Schools. I do not believe that if the benefit and worth of these programs was competently evaluated that these proposed cuts would be given a second thought by anyone who cares about the youth of this State.†† I understand that the economic situation is dire at this time, and I suggest that rather than taking away from those who already have close to nothing, consider making budget cuts that take a more ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach.†† The closing of these two schools will only succeed in making a bad situation much worse.

I strongly encourage you to withdraw this proposal and to visit these schools and learn more about their mission, structure, and the services they provide to this underserved population of troubled youth in our state.

Respectfully,


Bethany Passick

Comment: PLEASE DO NOT close or reduce funding to the Wright School or the Whitaker School. These programs and the services they provide to families in North Carolina are vital to essential behavior modification/re-training for youth who already struggle at home, in school and in their communities. Without such programs they will quickly become members of an invisible society in this state and another sad statistic of the failing mental health care system in North Carolina;

Please use your influence as governor to keep intact the budget of the  
Wright School, the most effective program for our state's mentally ill  
and most vulnerable children.

I know you agree that the best government is that which allocates  
resources to those who are least able to take care of themselves.  
Please continue full funding of the Wright School for children who are  
doing much, much better in the school's care than possible anywhere  
else.

     As a social worker intern in Warren County, I have seen what a 
lack of resources can mean for children in the foster care system. 
Children in care need structure, guidance, role models, and, in many 
cases, therapy. Warren County is poor and rural and its foster children 
do not get the funding, facilities, or opportunities that are available 
to children in larger counties. The Wright School and the Whitaker 
School have become an important resource to this county and its 
residents in recent months. These schools may be the only option for 
placement when children are affected by mental illness or severe 
behavioral issues.

     I have personally followed one student?s progression into the 
Wright School. The options available to this child were exhausted prior 
to application for enrollment to the Wright School. The agency and the 
family tried a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, a therapeutic 
group home, and intensive in-home services to assist the child with 
severe emotional needs. None were effective in curbing the child?s 
angry outbursts, improving his interactions with peers, or addressing 
the mental illness diagnosis. In the last few months, this child has 
made incredible progress with the guidance and support of the staff at 
the Wright School. For the first time, the treatment team has created 
an IEP directly related to addressing the child?s personal needs and 
holds monthly meetings to evaluate the child?s progress towards his 
goals. If goals prove to be unattainable in the short term, the team 
rewrites the goals into smaller steps so that the child will feel 
successful in his efforts to accomplish each item on the list.       
Not only has the Wright School been supportive of the child, but the 
staff has worked diligently on issues affecting the family as a unit. 
The school is assisting in reunification efforts between the mother and 
child and maintains a family centered approach at all times. Staff from 
Wright School have encouraged the mother to participate in a parenting 
workshop that they hold on campus as well as meeting with her one on 
one to address her individual parenting skill needs in her home. They 
approach this task at the mother?s pace and praise her successes at 
each turn. The team respects the outside relationships that have been 
formed with therapists and caseworkers who are not on their staff and 
give them an equal voice in the treatment plan for the well-being of 
the family.

     The Wright School has made an incredible difference in the life of 
one troubled boy from Warren County through dedication and diligence of 
the staff. This child came from public school where he was in trouble 
most days and a foster family who called the police because they could 
not handle his behavior. Today, he has received numerous awards for 
behavior, anger management, peer relationships, and academic progress 
based solely on the influence of the Wright School.  It would be a 
shame for such a valuable resource for the mentally ill in North 
Carolina to lose funding.

     Please help maintain the services provided at the Wright School 
and the Whitaker School through your vote on the state budget.

RE: Proposal to close Wright and Whitaker Schools



Dear Governor Perdue,



The Chatham County Board of Commissioners is requesting that you reconsider your decision to close both the Wright and Whitaker Schools, which provide critical residential mental health services for children from our county and across the state.† We understand your need to reduce State expenditures in these economically difficult times; however, eliminating these vital programs will not only put the lives of emotionally disturbed children/adolescents who are at risk of needing higher levels of care, but will actually cost the state and local governments considerably more in public expenditures over time.† Moreover, there are currently are no suitable replacements for these residential programs. Thus, even in the short term, the expenditures you might save in these two programs will result in additional and far more costly expenditures when this type of treatment falls completely on the other resources of the State and/or counties. (See the attached background information sheet.) The programs at Wright and Whitaker provide essential treatment for children/adolescents in need by working directly with the parents on how to more effectively communicate with and otherwise manage their young people at home.†



By all accounts these institutions are both programmatically and fiscally efficient and effective. Additionally, these two schools have received overwhelming praise from the population they serve and from the social service and educational professionals in their home communities.† Many of these children and adolescents have been able to return to their families and local schools after treatment.† Professionals with our Orange Person Chatham Area Mental Health Program, which during the last four years has successfully placed fourteen (14) and seven (7) Chatham County children in the Wright and Whitaker schools respectively, have confirmed this.



If these schools are closed, costs for treatment will rise and fall on other resources of the State or those served will be left to their own devices to compensate. The Wright School for instance, costs about $28,000 for the childís stay. If a group home and day treatment program were the option, that figure goes to something like $64,000.† More importantly, the costs to the children and adolescents, their families and their communities of eliminating these crucial residential services† is incalculable, as our District Court judges will attest.



Most important, these schools actually work. The return to a more normal life and reintegration into the regular school system is far better than hospitalization or inadequate treatment in some other setting.† The low staff turnover rate for both schools attests to the dedication, effectiveness and training of these professionals.



We urge you to keep these schools open and viable. There may be some areas of mental health that are redundant, where costs might be cut, but the Wright and Whitaker Schools are not in that category.



Thank you for considering our urgent request that you reconsider your plans to close these two schools.



Sincerely,



Chairman Dr. George Lucier

For the Board of Chatham County Commissioners

1. NOT reduce any funding to state budgets that serve people who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues.


2. NOT reduce funding to educational programs that provide services and supports to special needs children in North Carolina and to find a way to INCREASE funding sources to these vital programs.î


Additional talking points:
*Mental Health funding in NC is currently 43rd per capita among all states in funding for mental illness in NC. The current status of inadequate resources and funding for services provided to citizens of North Carolina who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues should not be exacerbated with additional funding cuts.

Comment: Why would you want to close the Wright's School in Durham, NC? If anything, We need more school like this one. And they need to be full time for our exceptional children rather trying to mimic thier program in the public schools which are failing in my son's and many other cases. Wright school was the only time in my 5 yr durham school experience (mu son is in 6th grade)where i could relax at work and know that my child was in good hands. The teachers are genuine in the way they treat our children. My son enjoyed his experience at Wright School and would like nothing more than to go there full time, but instead he is thrown into the public school system and is being set up for failure. The public school system has added trama to my son's life and with the unprofessional staff only add fuel to the fire, rather than de-excalate a situation. In my eyes Wright School is the only facility that has the knowledge and the right personel in place to handle the delicate situations of our exceptional children.

The Chatham County Board of Commissioners is requesting that you reconsider your decision to close both the Wright and†Whitaker†Schools, which provide critical residential mental health services for children from our county and across the state.† We understand your need to reduce State expenditures in these economically difficult times; however, eliminating these vital programs will not only put the lives of emotionally disturbed children/adolescents who are at risk of needing higher levels of care, but will actually cost the state and local governments considerably more in public expenditures over time.† Moreover, there are currently are no suitable replacements for these residential programs. Thus, even in the short term, the expenditures you might save in these two programs will result in additional and far more costly expenditures when this type of treatment falls completely on the other resources of the State and/or counties. (See the attached background information sheet.)The programs at Wright and Whitaker provide essential treatment for children/adolescents in need by working directly with the parents on how to more effectively communicate with and otherwise manage their young people at home.†

By all accounts these institutions are both programmatically and fiscally efficient and effective. Additionally, these two schools have received overwhelming praise from the population they serve and from the social service and educational professionals in their home communities.† Many of these children and adolescents have been able to return to their families and local schools after treatment.† Professionals with our Orange Person Chatham Area Mental Health Program, which during the last four years has successfully placed fourteen (14) and seven (7)Chatham†County†children in the Wright and Whitaker schools respectively, have confirmed this.

If these schools are closed, costs for treatment will rise and fall on other resources of the State or those served will be left to their own devices to compensate. The†Wright†School†for instance, costs about $28,000 for the childís stay. If a group home and day treatment program were the option, that figure goes to something like $64,000.† More importantly, the costs to the children and adolescents, their families and their communities of eliminating these crucial residential services† is incalculable, as our District Court judges will attest.

Most important, these schools actually work. The return to a more normal life and reintegration into the regular school system is far better than hospitalization or inadequate treatment in some other setting.† The low staff turnover rate for both schools attests to the dedication, effectiveness and training of these professionals.

We urge you to keep these schools open and viable. There may be some areas of mental health that are redundant, where costs might be cut, but the Wright and Whitaker Schools are not in that category.

Thank you for considering our urgent request that you reconsider your plans to close these two schools.

Sincerely,

Chairman Dr. George Lucier

We live in Wilmington, NC. where our Daughter, Natalie,†and her family live.† Our Daughter has a child, Jackson,†that has a mental health problem.†

Jackson at the time was age 9 when he†attended the Wright School last year from September of 2007 to March of 2008.

Jackson was unable to attend†public schools as a normal child.† He could not focus†on academics and had several behavioral problems.

After attending the Wright School, Jackson and his family was able to return to a more normal life and lifestyle.††

Those of you who have never experienced a child or grandchild who's mental health robbed
the entire family of a life†of nothing more than a meager existence just don't know how fortunate you are.† The Wright School was able to deliver to Jackson and his family a new life, a new future and a new meaning of existence.† In other words the Wright School and it's wonderful staff did what it took to get Jackson on the right track.

We cannot believe the State Government is even considering turning their backs on the poor helpless†children that need their help more than anyone in the state.† These kids did
not ask to come into the world this way, however, they are here and†it is not an option to turn your backs on them.

We urge you to keep this school open, it would be an unforgivable decision to walk away from the ones that need our help the most.

Jackson's Grandparents,

Ron and Linda Spinks

Subject: Mental Health Funding

Comment: 1. NOT close or reduce funding to the Wright School or the Whitaker School. These programs and the services they provide to families in North Carolina are vital to essential behavior modification/re-training for youth who already struggle at home, in school and in their communities. Without such programs they will quickly become members of an invisible society in this state and another sad statistic of the failing mental health care system in North Carolina; 2. NOT reduce ANY funding to state budgets that serve people who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues. To cut funding is equivalent to cutting lifelines of support for thousands of North Carolinians who need and deserve state suppo rted services in an effort to survive with a modicum of success in their communities. Cutting funds to these services is another statement of failure by the State of North Carolina to adequately provide for their most fragile citizens; 3. NOT reduce funding to educational programs that provide services and supports to special needs children in North Carolina and to find a way to INCREASE funding sources to these vital programs. Additional talking points: *Mental Health funding in NC is currently 43rd per capita among all states in funding for mental illness in NC. The current status of inadequate resources and funding for services provided to citizens of North Carolina who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues should not be exacerbated with additional funding cuts * In last year‚Äôs budget, new positions were established at institutions in order to correct the problems that led to loss of Federal accreditation. To cut those same positions is unwise- we will lose more than we will gain. At Broughton Hospital, we lost roughly $l million per month and at Cherry Hospital, we lost $800,000 per month as a result of the loss of federal accreditation. * For years, NC continues to underfund community services; this budget plan of ~$26 million in cuts to the community perpetuates the disparity in funding that is causing most of the ills in our system. Our community services must be built up. * The Governor made campaign promises to work on mental health, and to support the Centers of Excellence, intensive case management. * We cannot solve this by cuts alone; some revenue adjustments must be made Some of the proposed cuts which add up to ~ $50 Million include: Reduce community services $25.9 M Consolidate LME system mgmt $8.9 M Reduce Operating expenses - Central admin $250,000 Close two 25 adult bed units at Broughton, Cherry $6.02 M ATB ADATC (Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment Center) cuts $l.86 M ATB Central and Western Regional $l M Close Wright and Whitaker Schools $5.77 M Total: $49,774,659 million, 200 positions These cuts alone are dreadful, but the Summary of Reduction Options for FY 2009-10 indicates that the $50 M is not the only thing that will affect our families and people living with mental illness. It cuts across the services also offered in rural health, aging, child development, public health, social services, Medical Assistance, Vocational Rehab, and Corrections, in addition to reduction in payment rates and elimination of cost of living increases for providers. Examples of the cuts that will affect us that are not included in the above $49.7 Million: (meaning the impact is more than just $50 M) Elimina te psychiatric loan repayment which allows rural areas in particular to recruit psychiatrists $248,000 Reduce state county special assistance $5.38 M Implement preferred drug list atypical psychotropic drugs $12.672 M Reduce funds to NC housing finance agency $485,000 Eliminate contract with drug and substance abuse facility for male inmates $2.52 M Eliminate criminal Justice Partnership Program $9.76 M Chad F.
