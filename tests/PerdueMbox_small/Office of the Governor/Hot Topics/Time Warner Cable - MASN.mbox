Governor Perdue:

I'm so sick of this.  I am considering switching back to TWC, but this kind of thing makes me want to stay away.  If you get this over with before the MLB 2009 opening day, I would make the call immediately.

I know both TWC and MASN's position.  Act like adults and stop stalling.  THe courts have said you need to carry this channel (and, hopefully, it's HD channel) immediately.  Now DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network.

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.  I have been a life long Orioles fan and I am more than willing to pay to watch them.  But Time Warner and MLB does not even give us that option.  There is no logical reason why the state of NC should be considered local to Baltimore.  Because of the blackout restrictions, I am not able to order mlb.tv or MLB ExtraInnings.  Something needs to change.  Either force Time Warner to play ball or remove us from the blackout restrictions and let the die hard fans pay to watch their favorite team.

Governor Perdue:

When is Time Warner Cable going to start carrying MASN?  My last cable bill was $25 higher than the previous one, but we're still unable to get this channel!!  There appears to be no good reason why they aren't carrying it.  And of course, the 2009 season is almost upon us, and my beloved Yankees are playing their opening 3 games against the Baltimore Orioles, and we won't be able to see any of those games unless we go to an establishment that has DirecTV!!  I don't understand why Time Warner Cable won't at least make MASN available in their MLB Extra Innings package which we subscribe to each year at a total cost of $169.

Please tell Time Warner cable in North Carolina to give the fans a break and start carrying MASN.

This legal battle between Time Warner Cable and MASN is rediculous.

How long will the latest appeal to the FCC take? It has already been 3 months. 

If I could buy MASN or Orioles baseball I would, but since NC is considered Orioles territory I can not even get baseball thru a paid subsciption.

This is getting ridiculous.  I know the details of this dispute.  Each side has some valid points.  But, an arbitrator made a decision and it's time that TWC abide by it.  This has been appealed over and over again for 3 years.  Just do it!!!!!  Is another baseball season going to go by without being able to see the teams that MLB has designated as NC's locals (Orioles and Nationals)?

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network. 

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

Governor Perdue:

The fact that Orioles and Nationals game are blacked out here, yet neither team is covered by a channel on cable is ridiculous.  As a die-hard Orioles fan attending Wake Forest University, I've been completely shut out from watching my favorite team.   I cannot even buy the expensive MLB.com package to watch my O's on the internet because that would be blacked out as well. I would go so far as to consider this pricey investment if it were an option, even on a college budget.  

It's understandable to say that North Carolina is not the Orioles and Nationals home area.  Certainly more people in the area follow the Braves.  But not providing coverage and then on top of that blacking out the few games that are on national television (like the Orioles season opener last year against the Twins on ESPN) is ludicrous and unfair.

I can tell you right now that when I get out of college and more than likely settle down in the North Carolina area, I will second guess paying for cable if I am not able to follow the Orioles instead optioning for more other providers.  Please consider dropping your appeal and putting the Orioles and Nationals on tv in their own "home network."

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company Time Warner Cable of North Carolina refuses to carry the network. 

Time Warner Cable NC is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.  I have purchased the MLB Extra Innings Package from Time Warner, at great expense, for the past 5 years ONLY so that I can watch NY Yankees games.  However, the Extra Innings package blocks all of the Orioles games (a team in the same division as the Yankees) -- which amounts to at least 12 games per season that I am forced to miss.  This year that includes the opening series!  I cannot tell you how frustrated and disappointed this makes me!!!

Time Warner Cable seems to constantly be in dispute with stations and carriers that their customers want to view.  Just this past winter, TWC threatened to stop carrying Viacom channels while last year they were in dispute with MLB and almost didn't offer the MLB Extra Innings Package to their customers.  Time Warner Cable has got its customers by the short hairs since they are currently the only game in town.  They have lost several decision regarding MASN, but still refuse to carry the stations.  They claim that the cost would have to be passed on to their customers, which is apparently their stock line as the same excuse was used during the Viacom dispute!

Please help to end this media blackout by Time Warner Cable.  It's ridiculous that this media giant is able to dictate terms to the FCC, the courts, the state of NC, its clients/program providers, and its customers without penalty!  I pay over $100 per month to TWC for cable and internet, not including the approx. $170 I pay each year for the MLB package.  I truly believe Time Warner Cable should listen to its customers and provide the programming we ask for.  Yet time and again they ignore our pleas.  It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.  PLEASE TAKE ACTION TO HELP THE MANY FRUSTRATED SPORTS FANS WHO ARE STUCK WITH TIME WARNER CABLE.  

Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network. 

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.
I WILL SWITCH TO DIRECT TV IF TIME WARNER DOESN'T CARRY MASN.
