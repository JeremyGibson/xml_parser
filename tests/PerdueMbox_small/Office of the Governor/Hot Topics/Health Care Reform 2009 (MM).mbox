Dear Sen. Kay Hagan


I am a health professional and a member of the American Dietetic
Association.  ADA believes the health of our citizens should improve
as a result of our country's health policy choices.

To achieve that goal will require refocusing the current system and
providing adequate resources to maintain health and wellness.
Devoting resources to keep people as healthy as possible makes a great
deal of sense.  It also calls for a shift toward more disease
prevention, early detection, delay of disease progression and chronic
disease management in a continuum of appropriate strategies that
precede acute and end-of-life care.

Another goal must be to restructure Medicare and Medicaid so that they
are financially sustainable now and well into the future.  By
increasing the role of health programs, preventive care and disease
management, we can make reductions in expenditures while improving the
health status of beneficiaries.

Medical nutrition therapies have been unequivocally shown to help
patients help manage their health status.  Nutrition and diet are
associated with some of our most debilitating and expensive conditions
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, cancer, stroke and
kidney disease.  Diet and nutrition also are factors in other chronic
conditions such as pulmonary diseases, diabetes, liver disease, and
arteriosclerosis.   Many of these diseases and conditions are
manageable if caught early;  some can even be prevented or delayed
with nutrition care and services.

I realize that there is no health care reform bill yet introduced, but
both the House and Senate have committees working on provisions to be
included in the bill.   Congress should  be wise enough to recognize
the unique role nutrition plays in maintaining health.  Nutrition care
also is cost effective in preventive services and chronic disease
management.   I urge you to communicate your support for inclusion of
nutrition services to the appropriate offices now to help ensure they
will be a part of the original draft of the legislation.

As the Congressional debate heats up in the coming months, I will stay
informed and in touch.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact
either me or Ron Smith, ADA's Director of Government Relations, for
more information on nutrition and health.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and support.

Dear Sen. Kay Hagan


I am a health professional and a member of the American Dietetic
Association.  ADA believes the health of our citizens should improve
as a result of our country's health policy choices.

To achieve that goal will require refocusing the current system and
providing adequate resources to maintain health and wellness.
Devoting resources to keep people as healthy as possible makes a great
deal of sense.  It also calls for a shift toward more disease
prevention, early detection, delay of disease progression and chronic
disease management in a continuum of appropriate strategies that
precede acute and end-of-life care.

Another goal must be to restructure Medicare and Medicaid so that they
are financially sustainable now and well into the future.  By
increasing the role of health programs, preventive care and disease
management, we can make reductions in expenditures while improving the
health status of beneficiaries.

Medical nutrition therapies have been unequivocally shown to help
patients help manage their health status.  Nutrition and diet are
associated with some of our most debilitating and expensive conditions
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, cancer, stroke and
kidney disease.  Diet and nutrition also are factors in other chronic
conditions such as pulmonary diseases, diabetes, liver disease, and
arteriosclerosis.   Many of these diseases and conditions are
manageable if caught early;  some can even be prevented or delayed
with nutrition care and services.

I realize that there is no health care reform bill yet introduced, but
both the House and Senate have committees working on provisions to be
included in the bill.   Congress should  be wise enough to recognize
the unique role nutrition plays in maintaining health.  Nutrition care
also is cost effective in preventive services and chronic disease
management.   I urge you to communicate your support for inclusion of
nutrition services to the appropriate offices now to help ensure they
will be a part of the original draft of the legislation.

As the Congressional debate heats up in the coming months, I will stay
informed and in touch.  In the meantime, please feel free to contact
