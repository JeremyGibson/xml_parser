Subject: Gouging

Comment: Dear Governor First of all congratulations. I have noticed that we as North Carolinians are still paying fuel charges even though the cost of oil and fuel has decreased to a point that is below where most companies had begun charging fuel charges. Just this week I notices my Dominion Electric bill has a nearly 9.00 fuel charge on it as did a shipment I made via UPS. Isn't this a form of price gouging? Shouldn't these charges be removed across the State as the cost of the fuel has decreased to below "pre- fuel charge" levels?

Subject: Gas vs. Oil prices

Comment: Noticing that oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in a decade. So why is it that gasoline prices are going up? There is an article in the AP about oil prices dropping to $34 a barrel amid excess supply (http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/090120/oil_prices.html). Gas should be around $1.50 a gallon or less. So why is it inching back towards $2.00 a gallon?

Gov. Bev,

I know I have written to you before about the gas prices in NC and the taxes, doesn't seem to have done any good as gas prices continue to rise due to corporate greed. When is this greed including high taxes going to come to an end. I know you can put a stop to many of these problems if you just would do it. In stead of taking a vacation one would think you would be concerned with the welfare of the folks of NC. We need for things to change and you were voted in by the people to make theses needed changes and help us all out. Wake up, you are in charge of NC now, it's time to help the people, old, young, black or white, this state needs fixing.

Thanks,  sckoonce@aol.com

Subject: Rising Retail Gas Prices

Comment: Why isn't the government looking into why retail gas prices are on the rise when crude oil prices are falling. What is different now than in Dec 08 when retail prices at the pump in this state were on average $1.60 a gallon. There have been 13 consecutive price increases at the pump since January 09. When is the govenors office going to check into the reasons 'excuses' why. There is no doubt in my mind that greed on the part of distributors and oil corporate offices is behind the increases. They should be procecuted. I am sure that I am not the only one fed up with the almost daily price increases at the pump. Take a poll and see how many folks in this state are fed up with what is going on expecially when nothing is being done about it.

Subject: Rising Gas Prices

Comment: Governor Perdue, Why are gas prices continuing to rise in light of the fact that crude oil prices continue to drop? A recent article published by AAA (www.fuelgaugereport.com/market) in the Daily Fuel Gauge Report suggests that oil companies are "looking for more ways to cut back gasoline production and justify higher prices and profits" and "Industry watchers who trade gasoline trade futures seem to be persuaded the industry will eventually be able to cut the nation's gasoline inventories enough to keep retail prices at an elevated level. High gas prices have and continue to severely hurt this economy by reducing the amount of money that people have for mortgages, food, utilities, medical care, and other personal needs. I am all for finding alternative energy sources for auto, home and business, however, we can not afford these gas prices and do not accept the idea that 'at least it's not $4/gallon.' Please help. Best Regards,

Comment: Your Honor, With the current economic crisis, I have noticed the gas prices in Asheville and across the state begin to rise to almost $2.00 a gallon. All this while oil prices are still below and surpluses increases. What does your office plan do to help in this area?

Ms. Gov.
Here I am again, expressing the fact that gas prices are rising again for no reason. Point being we are in a "decession" that's between a depression and a recession, can it get worse YES. Now us retirees are having hard enough time without fuel and gas prices going up so high, NC is out of reach with high taxes. It's time YOU did something about these high taxes. There are very few jobs left in NC and you and your house  have an income coming in and money to buy gas, fuel and groceries but many of us do not. Cutting prices on taxes and gas prices and fuel and groceries need to happen. It's time somebody in Raleigh helped the people in NC and not themselves. I know I'm not going to hear anything from you I never do.
