Dear Governor Purdue,

Campaign promises are so easy to break, yet your promises to be with the the least among us resounded deeply within me. I cannot forget them.   At Union Missionary Baptist Church in Durham and again on two other occasions, key pastors and I witnessed your passionate promises to remember the poor and your poignant reminisces of your own youthful poverty. You were repulsed at the suggestion that your promises were merely platitudes. 

Governor, you have long ago escaped any poverty you might have expereinced, but in the months before and after your historic election very few of your constituents have been so fortunate.   The great political debate in our state has focused on platitudes about balancing the budget.  The debate has pitted the needs of the poor against the desires of the wealthy for tax cuts and need for a balanced budget.  "Balancing the budget", you will recall was the war cry of southern racists republicans in the 1970's and 1980's.  The terms "Balancing the budget" and "tax cut" were used to block the election of compassionate and fiscally responsible candidates and elected officials who pleaded for the budget to be balances and included programs that benefited minorities, the disadvantaged and others of among the least of us.  Tax cuts and balancing the budget was the mantra of Presidents Reagan, Bush, Bush, and their conservative cohorts.  Conservative political servants from both democratic and republican circles raised the mantra of balancing the budget as the excuse for omitting programs which benefited the poor and disabled, i.e. the very least among us.  As if the concept of inclusion of the poor in a balanced budget precluded fiscal responsibility, words such as "public dole", "welfare",and "liberals" were hurled at compassionate legislators who would fund mandates that benefited the least among us.    

In those days when the day was done, the budgets were passed, but programs to benefit the poor were absent or woefully under-funded.   Those with money interests, --the wealthy and connected, --had their needs met, the interests of the poor were shamefully omitted.  After all, the budget had to be balanced, --and it was often balanced on the backs of the poor. 

Governor Purdue, I am joining my NAACP colleagues, the HKOnJ partners, and the my colleagues in the ministry in pleading with you ,"Don't balance the 2010 budget on the backs of the poor!"  Please share my concerns with key members of the general assembly.  When you were running to be elected, you talked the talk.  I reiterate the position I took with you on the campaign trail.  "Walk the walk".  Let the people of North Carolina know by your words, your walk, your witness, and your works that you are called by God to make a difference in the state of North Carolina and in the United States.

When people take care of the least among us God takes care of all. Theodore Parker said "the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice."  Walk under the arc, Sister Beverly.

In His Service,
Rev. Mazie Butler Ferguson, JD

Dear Governor and members of the General Assembly," he dictated. "Don't balance the budget on the backs of the poor. the rich are not worried about the economy, but the middle class are slowly joining the ranks of the poor, and when the middle class disappears, and only the rich and poor remain, that will make America just like a third world country. don't let this happen! stop importing more than we export,  the companies who layoff Americans to get cheap labor in other countries,( yet they do not lower the prices on the products they sell to us) make them pay to bring their products back into this country, instead of letting them get richer at the price of American jobs, its up to our elected officials to say no more to these companies, please help the people who put you in office !!!!
