Dear Governor Perdue:

On behalf of young children and their families in Western North Carolina, I want to thank you for your support of Early Childhood Education Services in the 2009-10 State Budget.  Thank you for your recognition of the importance of the investment in young children between the ages of birth to five.  Adequate high quality subsidized child care is critical for North Carolina, not only to support the working families of North Carolina, but for the development of tomorrow's workforce.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am the owner of a large child care center in Durham with over 70 children who receive subsidy as well as a More at Four classroom. On behalf of these children, I would like to thank you for not cutting our funding.

Governor Perdue,

I want to thank you for your efforts to continue the funding for early childhood education services. As a former early childhood instructor and Smart Start Board Member for Gaston/Lincoln, I know that these funds are used directly to improve children's development.  I cannot imagine how difficult it was to determine the state's crucial funding needs.   

Currently, I work at Gaston College. After reviewing the budget  posted on your website, I appreciate your dedication to the community college system. 

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

As chair of the North Carolina Child Care Coalition, I want to thank you and your staff for the good job you did in creating a budget for our state that nurtures and protects our most precious seed corn, our young children. 



It is so important that our preschool children receive the kind of quality early care and education they are provided with Smart Start and More at Four.  We are also glad that more young, low income, working families will receive the child care subsidy that they need to continue to work.  That is critical to our state’s economic growth. 



Thank you for noting in your budget that most of those children are in 3 – 5 Star child care facilities.  Quality child care programs are key to preparing our young children to enter school ready to succeed.  Thank you for a budget that acknowledges the priorities for children.

Subject: SMART START BUDGET CUTS

Comment: This is a message for Governor Bev Perdue. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your proposal to cut funding for the North Carolina smart start program, the assistance that I was receiving for my daughter ended. I believe that everything happens for a reason, but I'm having trouble accepting this. I would like to enlighten you to my situation. I am a single mother of a beautiful seven month old daughter. Her name is Andie Elizabeth and she is my world. Unfortunately her father is not involved and does not pay child support. I work full time for the Sheriff's Office in my county as a 911 telecommunicator. I love my job, and they have been wonderful working with my schedule so I can continue to work there. I have also needed assistance with daycare, so that I can continue to work. I make just over $30,000 a year, which is a good salary, but not enough to really support my daughter as far as childcare is concerned. She attends Greenway Childcare Development Center. I absolutely love the staff and do not want her to stop going. Of course, I also donâ€™t want to have to quit my job and apply for welfare. The cost per week is $165. That equates to approximately $660 to $825 per month. I make too much money to qualify for any programs offered by DSS, short of the subsidy that I was receiving from Smart Start. I received a letter from DSS on the 10th of March advising me that the funding would end on the 20th of March. They said that legally they only had to give me two weeks notice. The letter was printed on the 6th of March, mailed on the 9th, and not received until the 10th. Iâ€™m not a mathematical expert but I hardly consider that two weeks. As far as the two week rule is concerned, it may be legal to only give a parent two weeks notice, but ethically it is wrong to not give more time. As a single mother, working full time, and not receiving child support it is mind blowing that I don't receive any aid. The only aid that I was eligible for was this program; not wic, not the Babylove program, no assistance with health insuranceâ€¦nothing. It is disheartening that children of aliens are now getting more help from the American government than a tax paying citizen. On top of that the local DSS office is more concerned with telling you their personal problems than helping you with yours. If I'm not mistaken, their job is to help people, which is a task at which they fail miserably. I know you canâ€™t control othersâ€™ actions, but you can control your own. I regret that I voted for you and will be sure to let everyone I know that a dysfunctional & unfair system that rewards you for not working, is even more screwed up thanks to your proposal. Please keep my daughter and I in your prayers because I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to come up with over $400 more a month.

I own a large childcare center in Harnett County and we also do More@ Four and your budget means so much to us. I have thirty two employees that will keep their jobs and 175 sets of parents that will also not have to worry about childcare. Most of our children are subsidized thur Smart Start and DSS and our parents could not work with out this help.

Dear Governor Perdue,



Thank you for excruciating work done by you and your staff in creating the proposed biennial budget.  As a provider of services for preschool children with disabilities and a member of the NC Childcare Coalition, I believe this budget is as fair and balanced as it could be in terms of early childhood services.  Doing the right thing for very young children is not just a “touchy-feely” kind of thing, it also makes excellent long-term economic sense.  Credible studies indicate that two years of quality early care and education will save over $250,000 per child over a lifetime in costs related to remedial education, welfare, incarceration, and violence-driven medical cost.  Former Hewlett Packard CEO Lewis Plant estimates that for every $1 invested in preschools, there is an annual return of $7.  The business community is catching on.



Thanks for your support for early childhood services.  It is a GREAT business decision.

Governor Perdue, 
    Thanks for your belief in action of the importance of Early Childhood Programs. Smart Start, More At Four, and Family Literacy programs all play a very different role in working with young children. Smart Start is aimed at Child Care Center while More At Four works best with the Office of School Readiness because of its focus on developmentally appropriate instruction for young children, and Family Literacy should be an allowable expense since young children and their parents, who are trying to earn their GED or learn to speak English come to school with their children. This is a unified program that works with the parent and their child in an educational setting. Thanks for believing in the positive difference we are making for young children and their families.

Subject: Smart Start WAGE$ Supplement

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I would like to start by telling you how much I appreciate you allowing the WAGE$ Supplements to be available to us for so long and it had made such a difference in my life. However, I just recently got an e-mail from The Smart Start Partnerships about cutting the WAGE$ Supplement and I am very deeply concerned. I have been in child care for four years, and counting. I am currently a preschool teacher in Forsyth County and I just love it! Having the WAGE$ supplement is crucial to my lifestyle because we all know that teaching is one of the lowest paid professions. In my opinion, teachers make such a big impact on our future because we are educating and influencing the children who are going to make a difference in generations to come. Teaching is not a "job" to me; it's a career and I enjoy the differences I make every day in these young lives. Having the WAGE$ supplement allows me to do what I love because I can barely make the bills, especially in this awful economy. I look forward to having the extra money every year because to me, it's like an extra award of appreciation for doing the job that I love. If the WAGE$ supplement were to be taken away, I don't think I can afford to teach anymore. Having the WAGE$ supplement also encourages me to go back to school and further my education because I want to do more and more to influence these children's lives. Having the supplement will help pay for my tuition and I can't emphasize how important it is to me and to many teachers in NC. Money spent on education and teachers is the best investment one can make. So please, please, please do whatever you can to keep the WAGE$ supplement available to us. You will not regret it. Sincerely, Jennifer Nguyen

Dear Governor Perdue,

   I want to express my appreciation for your recognition to the public that education cuts are not going to help our state in the long run in its growth and development.  We need educated citizens to help lead North Carolina in providing a wonderful quality of life for its people, as well as in helping to make this state an environmentally sustainable and beautiful place to live.  Thank you for your leadership in this area.
   I was shocked, however, to learn that you recommended that the Envronmental Education Department of the NCDENR be abolished.  Environmental Education is about making connections with the environment and our lives.  As an educator, I regularly see the disconnect that our students have with our environment.  It is so important that our students, as well the rest of our citizens, understand the importance and intertwining of our environment in our lives.  If we don't have opportunities to learn about and interact with the earth, the saying goes, then how can we care about the earth?  It is hard to care about something we know so little about.  The Environmental Education programs offer opportunities for people to understand the urgent importance of taking care of the earth. 
    I am an award winning teacher who effectively uses the natural world as a gateway to the lessons I teach in all curriculum areas.  I am thankful to the many educational classes that I have taken from the NCDENR, classes that have helped me see and understand the importance of taking care of the earth.  In return, I have shared this real world knowledge with my students.  My school's test scores are among the very best in the state, and part of the reason for that is due to the fact we teach using real world situations, many of which are gleaned from my studies of the environment.
    Please reconsider your request to abolish the EE Department of the NCDENR.  Instead please offer your support for more environmental education in our schools.  Mary Baldwin College in VA just opened a M.Ed. program in Environmental Education for teachers.  The US Legislature just approved the "No Child Left Inside" bill, recognizing the need to provide a greater effort in all states to provide environmental education opportunities for youth.
   Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about my effective teaching techniques using the natural world as an effective tool in teaching.   

Sincerely,

Though I could have afforded other alternatives and she did have other therapy through our health care, I can't understate the benefit of this program. I also don't understand why we can't find the money from other programs or the education lottery. Taking such a vital education away from our young children will have a devastating impact on our overall states education success. If you have not noticed we can't afford to lose much in this department, or did I miss our standing within the US when it comes to education. This is not the type of change we needed, or that I voted for. Please take into very serious consideration this program and its benefits. I would suggest you do some research on the benefits of the program before you eliminate it. It is always prudent to have facts before making important decisions such as this. Simply saying we don't have the money is not fact enough. If we can afford to build a single new road or bridge or lay salt on roads that a hardly impacted by snow or ice, we can surely find the money to fund important educational programs. Sincerely, Walter Gulledge IV

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I want to express my support for your decision to eliminate Smart Start, More at Four and Support Our Students. I respect your ability to recognize program failures and applaud your boldness in eliminating spending in areas that spending has little or no affect. Please also reconsider any future plans regarding free access to community colleges. I can tell you from 8 years of first hand experience in a foreign country that free college education only leads to career students with no stake in their own education. This in turn leads to a high drop out rate and wasted dollars as well as a generation of students who feel they are too educated to take entry level positions. I did not support you or your party in last yearâ€™s election out of concern for fiscal responsibility, my support for the Republican Party has also diminished and as a result Iâ€™ve registered as an Independent. A fiscally conservative government is one of the biggest challenges facing our culture and our country and has been for a very long time. I can only hope that you continue on this path Best regards, Mark Ceyrolles Single income father of six!

Thank you for protecting Early Childhood  Education. I am a director of a childcare program in McDowell County.. The center is church based non profit and we depend on Smart Start funding to support the center. Your support makes all the difference to the children of North Carolina.

Hello, my name is Brittany Barnes and I live in Robeson County. I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.  I am a social work major and I support the NC Child Welfare Collaborative. It is a very important program that helps many children, therefore I do not believe it should be cut.
Thanks for your time,
Brittany Barnes

Dear Governor Perdue,



You have a very tough job, trying to make “politican” happy.  I have a few comments for you to think about.



I have been in the day care business since August of 1996.  I don’t see where Smart Stop has helped the day care industry in North Carolina. According to their mission that is what they are suppose to do. I know they give money to DSS subsidy for working families, but isn’t that where the money was taken from, Children’s Services. They have “grants” that seem to only benefits certain people or certain businesses. There has been Millions of dollars (taxes) put in buildings, office equipment, etc.

Any Tax Revenue? 



What if Smart Stop were no longer here? And the money put back where it came from?



What about More At Four?  MAF does not help day cares, and Does it really help children? 

 MAF TOOK children from TAX paying day care and put them into a program that generates NO TAX Revenue.

Again. Who is MAF benefiting?  Public Schools, Head Start. Neither of which pay TAXES, Local or State.

If the money was put in DSS subsidy, Robeson County would not have 1200 children on a DSS Waiting List.



My center was licensed for 71 children. Due to Stars AND Licensure Fees from The Division of Child Development, we are licensed for 50 children. The Licensure Fees I have been told are going to be doubled July 2009. The Fees are not required of Non-Profits, Churches, Day Care Homes, Head Starts or Public Schools. Only Private For Profits.



Currently, we have 7 full time children, and 13 after-school kids. We have 2 full time (one of which is me) and 1 part-time employee. 7 or 8 years ago we had 9 employees and around 50 children.



We have to pay Local, State, Unemployment( that has skyrocketed, and of NO FAULT of day cares, NAFTA), Federal Taxes. We get NO tax breaks or incentives from no one. 



 If small businesses are the backbone of our economy, why is it that everybody is trying to break it?



Thanks



Kenny Britt

Governor Perdue,

Please continue funding for the child welfare collaborative. It is a cost effective way to provide training for qualified social workers in the field of child welfare. It also reduces high turnover which can be detrimental for the children. Positive outcomes for our children are increased through valuable programs like the child welfare collaborative. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Rebekah B. Horrell
