Subject: HB 708 State Employee Furlough

Comment: Govenor - I emplore you to not make use of HB708 and furlough state employees should the bill pass. My family can not afford an 8% pay cut which this would amount to. Both my wife and I are state employees. This is a double wammy for us and we have 2 in college! I'm sure somehow the teachers will be exempt and as usual they will be getting pay increases while the rest of us are getting pay decreases. Please consider raising taxes or cutting programs that benefit those that don't work and live off the middle class first!!! Thanks for listening to my opinion. -Ted Pless

Subject: Proposed Cuts to Educators

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue Please do not allow furloughs, 8% paycuts, increased deducitibles to educators' healthcare plans nor freeze longevity pay. WHile I realize that you have a tough job to do concerning the budget, I ask that you please reconsider from where the funds are being cut . We as educators do not make the big bucks, but we are dedicated to the children we teach and to promote North Carolina's future through our youth. However, many of us do not live in larger areas where the school systems offer high supplements to salaries. Many of us, like myself, live in small, rural communities where the supplement is small. We rely on the hope for ABC bonuses, Longevity pay, and certainly not a downward spiral in our pay. We too, have families who rely on use to feed them, clothe them, etc. I ask that you please reconsider the cuts to educators and advocate for us in these matters. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Kathleen Morgan

Dear Governor

I am state employee that is a single mother of 2. The purposed Furlogh Bill of 8% will put an extreme hardship on my family. If this passes this would be putting me into the position to go to my county Department of Social Services to apply for Assistance. I feel like that is defeating the purpose. Because the economy being so bad at this time, it would be sending the other state employees in this situation to their respective counties to do the same. How would that be helping?

Subject: Furloughs of State Workers

Comment: Governor Perdue: I'll start by saying that I'm a State Employee. I am deeply concerned by the General Assembly's drive to furlough employees - it's almost like they're not open to any other ideas especially when I read comments such as "I understand there are a lot of people who have an objection to it, but it's either that or you don't have a job," said Rep. Mickey Michaux, D-Durham. I truly get the feeling that either these Representatives and Senators have no idea what State Workers do for them and the Citizens or they're just against having State Workers period. A question I have in all of this - What is the General Assembly doing to help with budget considering the benefits they receive? Twenty days is a significant amount of time to be sent home without pay. Many of us, especially in these times, are living paycheck-to-paycheck and can't afford to be sent home this long. An idea that I have is to ask for voluntary furloughs initially. Honestly, I would do that rather then being told I had no choice. I have been with the State for 13 years and I now feel betrayed by the General Assembly - something I've never felt before.

Subject: State employee furloughs

Comment: Hi- I wish to express my concern over the Governor's reluctance to pass furloughs for state employees as opposed to cuts. I am four months pregnant, my husband is already unemployed, and I can certainly afford a furlough more than I can afford to lose my job and health insurance. Please rethink your position, or people like myself will simply rely on public assistance, still costing the taxpayers money.
