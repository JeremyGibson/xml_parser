Subject: Governor Purdue's proposed license fee professionals from $50.00 to$200.00.

Comment: What does the Governor plan to do with the additional $58 million for the next two years? Why are not teachers, professors, licensed plumbers and electricians etc. cosidered professionals? With the economy as it is, is this a good time to raise a fee to 400%?

I just received word that the Privledge License tax to be a Professional Photographer is proposed to increase from the current $50 to $200! After I pay that tax, I have the "Priviledge" of collecting taxes for the State each month without getting paid to do it. If I am late, the Department of Revenue is at the ready with Penalties and Interest!
My suggestion is to downsize Government. I always tickles me when we have snow and ice conditions in Raleigh, that only "essential" State Employees are required to come in. How about we trim back the State Government to "Essential Only" and see how the budget comes out!

Subject: Priviledge Tax increase

Comment: I have been informed by the State Board of Examineers for Engineers that Beverly Perdue is proposing an increase in the priviledge tax on engineers (among others) from $50 to $200 per year. Of course, I feel this is an unfair increase. Please investigate how many engineers are actually small businesses, and how the recent economy problems have affected us. Also investigate the fees we must pay to the State Board and to other states in which we are registered. A four-fold increase hurts financially and is an personal insult. Sincerely, Dan Campbell, P.E.
