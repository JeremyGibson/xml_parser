FYI:  These are the animals that are scheduled to die today in your state's animal shelters.  I am absolutely heartbroken that I am unable to do anything today to stop it.  I will be haunted for a long time.  Please stop this.

Governor Easley:

I am writing to you today to consider the cruelty of taking the lives of innocent dogs.  I am sure that you do not support abortion.  These dogs are already alive and have feelings and fears as do all of God's creatures.

Please consider this, and put an end to the inhumane murder of shelter dogs.

Thank-you.

Susan L. Hathaway
