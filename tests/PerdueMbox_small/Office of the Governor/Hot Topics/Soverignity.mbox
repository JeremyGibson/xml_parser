I have been reading that an increasing number of states have bills either passed or proposed affirming and/or asserting their 10th Amendment rights, being that "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

I have also noticed that North Carolina is not listed among those states.  As our governor, you have a responsibility to protect our Constitutional rights, even if that means protecting us from the federal government.  Can you offer an explanation as to why these steps have not been taken on our behalf?

As a citizen of the state of North Carolina, I am asking that you, our governor take the necessary and appropriate actions to protect our constitutional rights immediately.  The Constitution of the United States delegates to Congress a power to "lay and collect taxes, duties, imports and excises; to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof".

Please, protect us from the proposed absolute control the federal government seeks to impose on us all.  Fight for us to protect the liberties and freedoms guaranteed us by the Constitution of the United States of America.  Please, take care of your people; we, the People of the state of North Carolina.

Sincerely

DeeDee Daube

Subject: Asserting State Sovereignty Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, You may or may not be aware that more than a dozen other states have introduced legislation asserting state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. These states include: Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington. The aforementioned states acknowledge the need for such legislation because of the following: The scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be limited in its powers relative to those of the various states. Today, in 2009, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government. Many federal mandates are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The United States Supreme Court has ruled in New York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992), that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory processes of the states. A number of proposals from previous administrations and some now being considered by the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United States. In the event that the North Carolina General Assembly passes similar legislation, I hope that you too recognize the importance of sending a message to the federal government. Please support legislation reiterating state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. I kindly request a response regarding this matter. Thank you. Sincerely, John M. Lahtinen

Subject: Time For You To Step Up

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, In recent weeks and months States have stepped up and declared their sovereignty backed by the 10th admendment. It is time the same is done here in North Carolina. President Obama is dragging this country into the status of a third world country and you as Governor are at the helm of our future. Please act quickly before doing so will only be in vain.

Subject: State Rights

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue: Support North Carolina's Tenth Amendment/State Sovereignty Rights In light of the staggering procession of trillion dollar bailouts, loans, stimulus packages, and federal deficits in the context of a sharp economic downturn, over 20 state legislatures are considering resolutions to affirm their sovereignty over those powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution. Although such resolutions by themselves would not solve the problem of a federal government which dominates and bankrupts the states by ignoring the Constitution's provisions, these Tenth Amendment resolutions can serve as steppingstones to further state and federal legislation to restore the proper balance of power between the states and the federal government. In America there are two schools of thought about the role of the federal government: (1) Congress is limited in what it undertakes by the Constitution; and (2) Congress can do whatever it wants to do. If you favor a limited federal government as prescribed by the Constitution, please help to get North Carolina pass a bill supporting sovereignty by the North Carolina House and Senate.

Subject: egregious violations of the Constitution by the Federal Government

Comment: As a retired Marine, I deliberately chose this State as the most free and limited government state I've experienced. With our current federal government doing everything in its power to destroy the Nation, and with it becoming obvious it is a deliberate act, I am asking that my State, North Carolina, follow some of the many other States which have declared State Sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment, and take back the authority and responsibilities which have been usurped over time, by federal employees. This Nation was not established as a monolithic structure, and freedom cannot be maintained in such a Nation. It requires the individual States, with Sovereign Authority, vested in them by "The People" for freedom and liberty to remain, and North Carolina was one of the few States that recognised this as a fact, when the Constitution was ratified, demanding the Bill of Rights be made a part of it, as a condition for ratification. We are on the brink of being pushed into a communist Nation by the deliberate act of bankrupting the Nation, and destroying the ability to stave off international creditors. It is long overdue for us to return to the actual Constitution, and to God, who we took from in order to establish it on absolute truth, and Natural Law, or we shall cease to be the Nation and the State we were established as, before the term of this illegal alien is done with. Sincerely, John McClain GySgt, USMC, ret.
