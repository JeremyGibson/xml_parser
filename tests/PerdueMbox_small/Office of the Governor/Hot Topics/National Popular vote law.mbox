are you aware that foxes are turned loose within a penned area so that foxhound dogs can compete to chase and kill the red fox?  this is just a whisker above dogfighting.  the penned fox doesn't have a chance to get away.  we may as well make a sport of shooting fish in a barrel.  please support the legislators who are trying to stop this outrageous "hobby".  the foxes are part of our North Carolina natural resources.  my friends and relatives vacation in North Carolina and "hunt" foxes with binoculars and cameras.  Please let everyone enjoy the North Carolina fox and put a stop to the very unsporting "sport" of using packs of dogs to kill foxes in penned areas.  and if private landowners do not want fox hunters hunting dogs on their land, then please support their right to say "No!" Let's preserve our vanishing wildlife.

Thank you very your service to this great state.

I'm writing to urge you to back a national popular vote (H1270). In 2000, we received a wake up call that divided our nation. As a young person voting for the first time during the 2000 election, I felt like my vote really did NOT count because I resided in a republican state and voted for the democratic nominee. Please take steps to ensure that EVERY vote counts in the next presidential election. Please back a national popular vote.

TO: Governor Beverly Perdue


Several states have passed laws that would change the way we elect the President to a nationwide vote. This is a good idea. North Carolina should do the same. 

Since the Electoral College excludes candidates who do not win pluralities in any individual states from its total, a candidate can win the Electoral College without winning a majority of the popular vote of the nation.

This has happened 16 times since the founding of the Electoral College, most recently in 2000. In every one of these elections, more than half of the voters voted against the candidate who was elected. 

Please support this kind of legislation (H1270).

Respectfully yours,

Governor Beverly Perdue,

I would like to urge you to support the proposal to elect the President by a national popular vote in all 50 states (H1270).


When we vote for every other office, the candidate who gets the most votes wins. It should be the same for President.

I know you've probably gotten a ton of these so far and most of the same pretty much the same thing, but let's be realistic: the electoral college is an unnecessary and outdated form of electing our president. It was in place when the uneducated and illiterate didn't have the information of ability to vote for themselves, thus placing that vote in the hands of someone who did. That is no longer the case. While I'm sure we can both agree that voter turnout is poor in this country, we also both know it's because so many people feel t heir votes don't count. And they're right! For the minority parties in any given state their vote does not count and they know it. 

As glad as I am to have Barack Obama in office, the actual popular vote was incredibly close, but Obama's victory was called a landslide. I'm so happy that he won.. but it wasn't a land slide with literally almost half the country voting against him. What it was, was a close call. Even worse, Bush was elected by electoral vote but not by popular vote meaning that the majority of voters didn't even want him there.

You and I both know this is a problem that needs to be solved. Please. I was born and raised here in North Carolina and am now raising my family here and I want this state to be part of a progressive movement that does what's best for the people. 

Most sincerely,
Heather L Spealman

Beverly Perdue,


I've read about the plan to elect the President by a nationwide popular vote, and I think it is a great idea. This is the way we fill other offices.


The Electoral College method is defunct is not representative of the will of the people. Please vote for this (H1270).

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am writing to ask you to support the National Popular Vote bill (H1270). The candidate who gets the most votes should become President. Electing the President of the United States by popular vote is the right thing to do.


North Carolina should join Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois and Hawaii in passing the National Popular Vote legislation and take a leadership role in bringing fairness to our Presidential elections.

Most sincerely,

Governor Beverly Perdue,

North Carolina should support any legistlation that enables a popular vote to replace the archaic electoral system. Support this kind of legislation and bring the change that I vote for. There is little to no popular support for the electoral system, and the vote would only help your position with your constituency, never hurt it. Thank you. (H1270).

Most sincerely,

Please help modernize the American system of elections by supporting the proposal to elect the President by a national popular vote in all 50 states (H1270).


No longer should presidential elections go to the candidate who loses the popular vote. The current electoral college system may have had legitimate purposes in the past, but today it only alienates voters and gives unproductive results.
