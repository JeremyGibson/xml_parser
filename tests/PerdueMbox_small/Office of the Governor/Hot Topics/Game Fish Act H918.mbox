Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to ask your support for a bill that was filed today H918 to designate red drum and trout as game fish, therefore not allowing them to be harvested with nets.  This is a huge problem on our coast and the efforts of the commercial fishery continues to make it very difficult for recreational fisherman to enjoy the species.
<http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/House/PDF/H918v0.pdf>http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/House/PDF/H918v0.pdf
If you look at the successes of neighboring states, you will see we are the last state that allows netters for these fish.  Please support this bill when it comes to a vote on the floor.

Best regards,
Ed Pupa

Dear Governor Perdue,



Please support the Coastal Game Fish Bill, H918. Our coastal economy needs the monies that these recreational fishermen pour into our economy every year. Please let me know what your position on this is as soon as you see all the facts. We live on Topsail Island and depend on this money every year.



Sincerely,

Marilyn Phillips

Dear Governor Perdue,

     It is with great importance that I write to you this evening. Did you know that NOAA estimates that "marine anglers fishing in North Carolina in 2006 spent a total of $2.03 billion (the 5th highest total across the 23 coastal states). The $2.03 billion in expenditures generated $2.5 billion in total sales to businesses located in North Carolina, provided $780.8 million in personal income to workers in North Carolina, and supported 23,782 jobs in the state."

      As you well know North Carolina's fisheries resources have been considerably hindered by blatant misuse through commercial overfishing and destructive gear practices. There is irrefutable scientific data available though our North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Council website(s) that supports the overwhelming degredation of our fish stocks concerning trout and red drum, our state fish.

     As one of over 400,000 resident licensed coastal recreational anglers I urge you to support the Coastal Game Fish Act Bill H918. It is time North Carolina's fisheries management caught up with the rest of the Atlantic States and offered more to it's resident and visiting anglers.

Sincerely,
Captain Seth Vernon~

Dear Governor Perdue,



In the coming days you will be hearing from many of the 400,000 licensed saltwater anglers from not only here in NC, but from around the country! Please listen to them! When NOAA recently released its study on the 23 coastal states, one of the Co-authors of that study, Scott Steinback, actually did the calculations for us for accuracy. The entire study can be viewed at this link.. <http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st5/publication/marine_angler.html>http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st5/publication/marine_angler.html



They estimate that in 2006, the Saltwater Anglers here in NC generated $2.5 Billion in sales to NC businesses, generated over $780 Million in wages and salaries to NC workers, and supported 23,782 jobs here in NC.



Believe it or not, Saltwater recreational fishing is one of NC’s Largest income producing treasures! It needs to be treated that way. This bill does not call for an all out net ban like SC and most of our Southern Coastal states have done. It is a more “centrist” position. The pursuit of the Red Drum and the Spotted Sea Trout by both Recreational Fishermen and Commercial Fishermen is exasperated by the fact that it occurs in “close quarters” back in our coastal and inland creeks. Many times this area of conflict is no wider than a city street!



This is like throwing a cat and a dog in a closet and hoping everything turns out OK.



Due to the rapid growth of NC and the dynamics of the retiring baby-boomers, this “user conflict” will only get worse with time. Ask the DMF, they will tell you the same thing. This bill obviously will not make everyone happy, but it brings cash mitigation to the table, and ultimately will end most of the user conflict.



This is finally one issue that rises high above party politics. All the imposing factors demand action. We are fishermen from all walks of life, Republican and Democrat hand in hand with the same goals. Please support H 918, the Coastal Game Fish Act!



Sincerely,

Coastal Fisheries Reform Group

Greetings,


I would like to encourage you in the most strenuous of terms to support H918, The Coastal Game Fish Act.


I recently moved here from Florida where red drum and speckled trout where granted game fish status, which has also been done in the several Atlantic and Gulf coastal states with great success. The result of these actions has contributed greatly to the preservation and enhancement of these species with a resulting increase in tourism, fishing licenses to residents and tourists, retail sales of fishing equipment and boats, property rentals and et cetera. Tax revenues from those transactions have increased accordingly.


While no one wants to see further impact to anyones honest and fair livelihood, continued commercial exploitation of these fish species as food will only result in their decrease and possible demise. By declaring red drum and speckled trout to be game fish the health of these populations will be guaranteed, a claim commercial fishermen cannot make.


Many thousands of anglers around the nation support the kind of measures delineated in H918. Many thousands of your North Carolina voting constituents also support these measures, and we look forward to supporting those who seek to further preserve the environment through reasonable means such as these.


I encourage you to vote Yes on H918.


Thank you for your kind consideration of this request,


Edward C. Maurer

Dear Madam Gov and Representatives:

Ref H918 - the Coastal Game Fish Act - I and many others have received a message from a local Guide, telling of flounder nets set across prime Red Drum and Speckled Trout waters, where there have been NO flounder caught over the minmum size limit for years, but where the Red Drum bycatch lay dead or drying in the nets.

Yes, these nets were set in-season, and the legality of the placement or attendance is not the point  here, although MF told the Guide there was virtually nothing they could do about the illegal out-of-season waste.  The point is, that the mess the Legislature has made of the fishing regulations, coupled with the highly questionable if not illegal activities of a certain number of commercial fisherman WHO KNOW THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, are going to eventually eliminate the stock of Red Drum and Speckled Trout just as the commercial crowd pretty much eliminated the Grey trout stocks in our waters because NO ONE WOULD STAND UP TO THE COMMERCIAL MONEY to declare those fish as Game Fish. 
The Greys are gone, but now with H918 you at least have a chance to save the Red Drum and the Speckled Trout as Game Fish.

Hopefully, you will pass it.  We know that the 400,000 recreational fishermen in our State don't represent the money, nor the political "pull" that the commercial groups have, but there comes a time when the very existence of the thing they want to kill till it's totally gone and we want to try to preserve in some sort of balance for all of us in the future is at hand.  This is that time.

Hopefully, you will understand that it's not "us against them" - it's about the fish.  When these fish are gone because of the commercial attacks on the stocks, whether was a money crop or as waste, then what will the commercial groups go after next?  There has to be some point where you say "enough".

Do you care?  Can you overcome the commercial money and political influence long enough to do this?

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

     In regards to HB918. I ask is it really necessary to put more regulations on an already overburdened commercial fisherman just trying to get by? Every year I depend on the spring run of trout and the small amount of drum we are allowed to keep as "by-catch" in the fall while flounder fishing. Even though the drum stocks were declared recovered years ago and trout stocks listed as viable I see no reason to shut these fisheries down. In these hard economic times is it necessary to take money out of my pocket and a food source away?      The recreational sector would have everyone believe that there will be no fish if we are not stopped, and commercial fisherman are the evil murderers of the sea. Commercial fishing is one of the oldest business' in the state and there is now more fish than ever! I believe everyone has rights to our fish but to declare "exclusive rights" on fish that some people depend on I think is morally wrong and selfish. I may be too late to make a difference, but I thought I should at least share my thoughts on the matter.

Goveror Perdue,

I was writing as a concerned angler and responsible citizen. I have made my career as a recreational fishing guide, and I have seen many changes in the fishing industry since I became a full-time fishing guide in 1996.
One of the most important changes that has been made is a big-bold leap towards conservation and realization that our resources are renewable if they are cared for in the proper manner; however, if cared for improperly or not cared for at all these resources that we all rely on so much will not sustain themselves forever.
I graduated from Appalachian State University with a degree in Recreation Management, and during my college days I did a term paper on the recreational value of a fish versus the commercial value of a fish. And now in my career after I have taken nearly 2000 anglers fishing in NC and TN I realize the true value of the resources. I have recently started in new business located in east Tennessee worth in the neighborhood of $ 2 million, and we depend upon the sustainability of our wild resources for the success of that business.
I find it very odd that NC is one of the premier saltwater fishing states in this country and we do so little to protect our resources. I just read in the current issue of Wildlife in NC that NC is in the top five coastal recreational fishing states in realtion to economic value. Coastal recreational fishing generates $ 2 billion for this state while Florida ( #1 ) generates $16.7 billion. There is no arguing that Florida has more coastline and a more storied tradition in regards to coastal angling, but they were also one of the first states to proactively protect their marine resources with the Inshore Net Ban and the Longlining Ban. Why can't NC follow in Florida's footsteps and become one of the leaders in marine conservation? Be assured if we could do that, we would start to follow in their footsteps in relation to the massive recreational fishing industry that exist in Florida. 
Thank you for your time and your consideration.

I urge Governor Perdue to actively support the passage of H 918, the Game Fish Act.  I am sure the Governor will be provided with all the pertinent facts, figures, etc. to assist in her decision making process, so I'll just ask for her help on behalf of the Red Drum and Specs that will ultimately benefit from passage of this bill.

Thank you.  I am a registered Democrat from Pamlico County who voted for President Obama, Gov. Perdue and a straight Democratic ticket, just in case you track those kinds of things.  And, yes, I am a recreational angler, in constant awe of our coastal resources, including these two fish.

Dear Governor, Representatives and Senators:

As a current resident of Wake County, and a registered voter, it is with great importance that I write to you this evening.  The Coastal Game Fish Act – Bill H918 is set to go through the House, and it is imperative that the bill be passed.  North Carolina's fisheries resources have been considerably hindered by blatant misuse through commercial overfishing and destructive practices. There is irrefutable scientific data available though our North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Council websites that supports the overwhelming degradation of our fish stocks concerning trout and red drum (our State Fish!!!).



As one of over 400,000 resident licensed coastal recreational anglers I urge you to support the Coastal Game Fish Act Bill H918. It is time North Carolina's fisheries management caught up with the rest of the Atlantic and Gulf States and offered more to its resident and visitors.  Our current management practices are an embarrassment to our residents and our elected officials, and I, along with a significant portion of the current licensed coastal recreational fisherman, will be making many of my future voting decisions based on the support my Governor, Representatives and Senators give to this Bill.



If economic evidence of the contribution of recreational fisherman is important to you, please not that NOAA estimates that marine recreational anglers fishing in North Carolina in 2006 spent a total of $2.03 billion (the 5th highest total across the 23 coastal states). The $2.03 billion in expenditures generated $2.5 billion in total sales to businesses located in North Carolina, provided $780.8 million in personal income to workers in North Carolina, and supported 23,782 jobs in the state.



If practical examples of the degradation of our red drum stocks by commercial fisherman are of importance, I refer you to the below email from Captain Seth Vernon, an inshore fishing guide out of Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Island NC.  I’ve also included a photograph taken by Captain Vernon on March 31st.

Thank you for your time, and if you would like to visit the website dedicated to the aforementioned Bill, please see the address below. I implore you to make the right decision when this Bill reaches the House.

Good Morning Governor and Legislators,



Gov. Perdue

Sen. Boseman, Sen. Harry Brown,

Rep. Justice, Rep. McComas, Rep. Hughes, Rep. Grady, Rep. Cleveland, Rep. Tucker



     My name is Captain John Seth Vernon and I am a full time charter fishing captain specializing in inshore fishing along the Cape Fear coast headquartered out of Wilmington. I am contacting you all this morning in an effort to share with you the devastation our fisheries resource is facing in the hands of destructive commercial fishing gear. I know you are all aware of the most recent bill Coastal Game Act H918 and have received a letter from me requesting your support. I would like to thank several of you in advance for the time and effort you have invested in supporting this important piece of legislature.



     The specific reason for my communication this morning is simply to lay the facts upon you and let you decide what seems right or wrong with this scenario.



     The overview is simple I was performing a routine charter on the 31st of March in North Topsail Island for an angler/client of mine, Mr. Michael Schilawski, who is a lawyer from Raleigh, NC. While on the charter we encountered three 200+ yard long flounder gill nets unattended in Goose and Alligator Bay(s). It is not illegal to leave these nets unattended at this time. These nets were set in the exact areas I have been guiding for schooling redfish all winter long. Not only were the nets devoid of any flounder upon visual inspection but they were meaninglessly entangling, gilling and drowning large numbers of red drum, which need I remind everyone are illegal to possess by commercial fishermen at this time because the quota was exceeded again last year. Therefore commercial fishermen are allowed to kill these fish, discard the carcasses and keep their gill nets in the water until they catch the very few flounder that still survive in these shallow coastal bays. I urge you to help us find a better way for both user groups to have just use of this resource. My user group the 400,000 recreational fishermen in this state are not being fairly represented and that is only one of many reasons why we need game fish status for red drum and spotted sea trout.



     Below you will find a letter I drafted and emailed to CCA NC, Coastal Fisheries Reform Group, all of my charter clientele (over 300 anglers), Lt. Ervin of the NCDMF, Mike Connor of Shallow Water Angler Magazine, Jerry Dilsaver of North Carolina Sportsmen Magazine and my fellow guides and anglers across this state.



(Begin Forward Letter)





     It is with great urgency that I write to you this evening. Today was an important day when it comes to fisheries conservation in North Carolina. With the drafting of our new bill H918 Coastal Game Fish Act 400,000 licensed saltwater recreational anglers across this state have an opportunity and a responsibility to speak up, stand accountable and pressure the NC legislature to pass this bill to protect the future of these valuable game fish.



     If you don’t see what’s threatening this resource just take a look at the pictures I have attached here from my charter today March 31, 2009.



     I have been fishing the greater Topsail region for four years now and all winter while the red drum fishery was closed I have not seen a single net in the water. Today I found three very extensive unattended flounder gill nets stretched in the exact areas where I have been guiding my anglers for redfish this season. There was  a large span of net dissecting the middle of Goose Bay and two more nets in the Northwest corner of Alligator Bay, both bays are on the west side of the waterway just south of New River. In Goose Bay there were two dead redfish discards, and in Alligator Bay there was one redfish entangled dying or dead for every 10 feet of net. There were over 7 redfish per net and over 600 feet of net in Alligator Bay today. I saw roughly 15 dead or dying mature redfish that won’t benefit any user group! I’ve been fishing this area all winter and haven’t seen a Flounder over ten inches all season. The commercial fisherman responsible for this irresponsible action is Mr. M. Rhodes, Commercial Lic. #NC 3843AU. I can assure you he will not be held accountable by the NCDMF for the meaningless slaughter of these valuable game fish.



     I phoned one of our local officers and he openly admitted there was nothing he could do to correct this terrible situation. By law the commercial fishermen can kill these fish while attempting to fish for flounder even though the redfish by catch season is closed and commercial fishermen are not at present allowed to possess or sell these fish. I ask you this question, if this was happening to turkeys, whitetail deer or ducks don’t you think there would be a lot of angry sportsmen writing and calling to complain to there legislators?



     The time for action is now, write your senators and representatives, call your influential associates and be an advocate for your fishery before it’s too late! We need game fish status now!



Respectfully Yours,

Captain Seth Vernon~

Dear Governor Perdue,



My name is Joseph Price and I live in Wilmington, NC.  I wanted to write and encourage you to support the Coastal Game Fish Act, H918.  This is important to me as this is a crucial step towards re-establishing our fishery here in coastal NC.  I travel down to Charleston, SC 2 or 3 times a year to fish where these fish are protected.  During these trips, I spend upwards of $400 - $500 in fuel, license’s, and lodging to enjoy the good fishing and I’m tired of spending my money is SC.  Others may argue that their superior fishery is due to climate but I firmly believe that it is due to their established protection of these species via assignment of game fish status and their ban of inshore gill-netting.  I can assure you that others who travel out of state for recreational fishing are tired as well.  I’m ready to not only keep my money in-state but also to witness the overall economic benefit that would result from others coming here to experience what could be a world renown inshore fishery.  Coastal NC has the habitat potential to become a recreational fishing destination that would equal, if not surpass, Louisiana and Texas.  I’m ready for these fish to receive the attention and protection that they deserve. 



Respectively,



Joseph Price

Dear Governor Perdue.

I am respectfully asking for your support for H-918, a bill to protect Spotted Seatrout and Red Drum. These fish are far too important to the North Carolina economy as recreational sport fish to allow their commercial sale. According to a NOAA study, recreational saltwater anglers, converging on the NC coast in 2006 spent over two billion dollars on the sport. That is 5th highest of the 23 coastal states. The 2006 expenditures provided over $780 million in personal income for NC workers, and supported 23,782 jobs in our state! You'll be bombarded with statistics in this bill, but the bottom line is it's the right thing to do for the state and for the resource.

I live nearly 300 miles from the coast, and travel there to fish 8 to 12 times a year. It's important to me and thousands of salt water anglers from every district in NC to have a healthy marine environment with the resources protected for current and future generations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Perdue, Senator Basnight, and Representative Spear,
I was born and raised in this wonderful state of North Carolina. I spent my early years in the Piedmont but have lived with my wife and two sons on the Outer Banks ( Kitty Hawk ) for the last 30 years. I am currently 56 years old and  have fished the coastal waters of NC for the last 50 years with my family and friends. I remember stories from my grandfather and father and also experienced myself the endless abundance of all fish in the sounds and tributaries from Cape Fear to Currituck. I am extremely alarmed at the decline of the fisheries in our states' coastal areas. Where once you could easily catch croaker, spot, gray and speckled trout, flounder, drum, bluefish, and mullet to name a few now we are fortunate to catch anything at all!
With game fish status for speckled trout and red drum as proposed in Bill H-918 maybe we can experience the same explosive growth in these fish stocks that the Gulf Coast and neighboring states to the south have seen. I fully support Bill H-918 and hope that you will as well.
Sincerely,
Bill Winstead

Dear Representatives,
My name is Edmund H McGovern Jr and I am emailing you with my concerns about Bill H918. I have been a commercial fisherman for more than 25 years as well as run a local seafood market in the area for just as long. I have fished these waters along with several other commercial fisherman in the area for many years and am appalled that anyone would try to regulate these fish in a time such as this. I agree that we should be mindful of abusing our natural resources, but having dealt with both species of these fish for several years, i don't really see  the need for more regulation at the moment. I have personally witnessed more recreational fishermen than ever come into our local waters and fish for the 'Giant Puppydrum' that usually run in the late summer to early fall. Granted these fish are usually thrown back, there have been more people than ever trying to partake in catching them. Along the same lines come the commercial fishermen, who don't fish out of sport, but out of necessity. These men are out there fishing for their families in order to make a means to put food on the table, and are hardly damaging the ecosystem. With only around $800,000 in total revenue from these fish combined, it seems trivial to think that they are being over fished. If anything, the over fishing comes from the Recreational guys who fail to follow the rules and regulations set out for them, after all, their families aren't depending on that days catch to support them, its just 'for the fun of it'. Not to mention the fact that our economy is in a down swing, now why would we want to put restrictions on a very viable means of income for some people. Commercial fishing doesn't take very much money to start up and can be a very effective tool to add additional support to someones income. Also, we as commercial fishermen cannot stop where or how the fish run, if they get caught in our nets over night, most of them are dead by morning. So instead of being able to sell these fish, we are forced to throw them back and lose not only the life of that particular fish, but the income it could have provided, or the belly it could have filled up for someones family. We also need to look closely at the information that was given about the over fishing of these 2 species. Why should we be compared to Florida in how much was brought in from the recreational side? Florida has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation, due in large part to people over extending on their means of living, which could very well include hobbies and sports, such as fishing. Not to mention the fact that Florida is an area high in retirees and people who live lavish lifestyles, they are more equipped financially to spend money on a hobby, up here in North Carolina, you don't find that many wealthy people along our coast. We live by modest means, and shouldn't have yet another work opportunity snatched away from us, there has been enough job loss in the area, so why don't we create some jobs for a change? I personally believe that we have become just like Wall Street, where the ones who get punished are the ones who actually have to work for a living, while all along, the ones who don't depend on the resources, reap all of the benefits.
Please think twice before you vote on this Bill, it is a matter of someone's job versus another man's hobby.
Sincerely,
Ed McGovern Jr.

Dear Governor Perdue,

My name is Tommy Dail and I'm a Winterville, NC resident who enjoys our great outdoors and the opportunities it affords me and my family.

I'm an avid speckled trout and puppy drum angler who enjoys the thrill of catching (and mostly releasing) these fish. Last fall my fishing buddy and I were fishing in the Campbell Creek area for specks with not much luck with our rods and reels, however we still had a great time other than having to sit back and watch two gentlemen setting gill nets and making an impressive haul of these fish and some other species. It's disappointing to realize that my buddy and I were limited to 10 fish each, which I feel is a fair creel limit, while these two gentlemen fall under no limits and had little regard for the small dead fish they threw back into the water.

I ugre you to please consider voting for Bill #H918 which is currently in the NC House of Representatives and would give the Speckled Trout and Red Drum "Game Fish Status" and indeed give them a chance to be a viable game fish when my children and grandchildren are enjoying the North Carolina Outdoors.

Thanks in advance for your consideration!

Respectfully,
Tommy Dail

P.S. We furnished the Andersen windows and doors for your home in New Bern and hope you're enjoying them. Thanks!

RE: H918, Coastal Game Fish Act



Dear Governor Perdue,



In the coming days you will be hearing from many of the 400,000 licensed saltwater anglers from not only here in NC, but from around the country! Please listen to them! When NOAA recently released its study on the 23 coastal states, one of the Co-authors of that study, Scott Steinback, actually did the calculations for us for accuracy. The entire study can be viewed at this link.. <http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st5/publication/marine_angler.html>http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st5/publication/marine_angler.html



They estimate that in 2006, the Saltwater Anglers here in NC generated $2.5 Billion in sales to NC businesses, generated over $780 Million in wages and salaries to NC workers, and supported 23,782 jobs here in NC.



Believe it or not, Saltwater recreational fishing is one of NC’s Largest income producing treasures! It needs to be treated that way. This bill does not call for an all out net ban like SC and most of our Southern Coastal states have done. It is a more “centrist” position. The pursuit of the Red Drum and the Spotted Sea Trout by both Recreational Fishermen and Commercial Fishermen is exasperated by the fact that it occurs in “close quarters” back in our coastal and inland creeks. Many times this area of conflict is no wider than a city street!



This is like throwing a cat and a dog in a closet and hoping everything turns out OK.



Due to the rapid growth of NC and the dynamics of the retiring baby-boomers, this “user conflict” will only get worse with time. Ask the DMF, they will tell you the same thing. This bill obviously will not make everyone happy, but it brings cash mitigation to the table, and ultimately will end most of the user conflict.



This is finally one issue that rises high above party politics. All the imposing factors demand action. We are fishermen from all walks of life, Republican and Democrat hand in hand with the same goals. Please support H 918, the Coastal Game Fish Act!



Sincerely,



Coastal Fisheries Reform Group

Governor Perdue,
I am a Dare County resident and voter who gladly cast my vote for you in 
the last election, and was very pleased that you were elected.  I am 
also a sometime recreational fisherman who is concerned with the 
continuing decline of finfish species in the waters of our state.  The 
State of North Carolina is sadly behind other states in protecting the 
fish native to our waters, at least in part due to the powerful 
commercial fishing interests in our state.  It is long past time to 
begin taking steps to stop the decimation of these species by 
overfishing.  HR 918, which will protect two of these species, the red 
drum and speckled trout, needs your active support to pass and become law.
Please do all that is in your power to make this bill into law.
Thank you,
Chuck Voigt

Ms. Purdue,
Regarding house bill 918 and it's attempt to classify Red Drum and Speckled trout to gamefish status. I am strongly opposed to this bill based on the fact that it runs contrary to the intent of the Fisheries Recovery act and the Fisheries Management Plans (FMP's) designed to protect the resource while considering both recreational and commercial fisheries and the general population as a whole. The Red Drum FMP has proven very successful and the Speckled Trout FMP is in it's early stages. I say we utilize these tools that were designed to serve all user groups. Not everyone has the desire or ability to go to the coast and fish, but if they enjoy eating these fish, they rely on the commercial fishermen to supply it to them. Excluding one user group so as to benefit another should not be the goal of fisheries management nor that of the NC General Assembly. It should be about protecting the fishery itself and should use science as a guideline and not the whim of some special interest group.
Please vote NO on HB 918.

Thanks!

 It is with great importance that I write to you today. Did you know that NOAA estimates that "marine anglers fishing in North Carolina in 2006 spent a total of $2.03 billion (the 5th highest total across the 23 coastal states). The $2.03 billion in expenditures generated $2.5 billion in total sales to businesses located in North Carolina, provided $780.8 million in personal income to workers in North Carolina, and supported 23,782 jobs in the state."

      As you well know North Carolina's fisheries resources have been considerably hindered by blatant misuse through commercial overfishing and destructive gear practices. There is irrefutable scientific data available though our North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Council website(s) that supports the overwhelming degredation of our fish stocks concerning trout and red drum, our state fish.

     As two of over 400,000 resident licensed coastal recreational anglers I urge you to support the Coastal Game Fish Act Bill H918. It is time North Carolina's fisheries management caught up with the rest of the Atlantic States and offered more to it's resident and visiting anglers.

Dear elected officials, 
Please support the Game fish act H918.  This critical piece of legislation will allow us to protect what is left of our fisheries for our children and the future of our state.
Please, please support this legislation.  Gill nets are killing off all of our fishery.  The time for change is now.

Dear Honorable Governor Perdue,

I am writing to support Bill H918, which gives game fish protection for speckled trout and red drum fish. My family lives, works and fishes on the Outer Banks of NC, so this bill is very important to us.  I appreciate your hard work for our great State, and I would appreciate your support on this Bill.

Thank you,

X-Folder: Game Fish Act H918

Dear, Governor Bev Perdue

      It is with great importance that I write to you today. Did you  
know
that NOAA estimates that "marine anglers fishing in North Carolina in  
2006
spent a total of $2.03 billion (the 5th highest total across the 23  
coastal
states). The $2.03 billion in expenditures generated $2.5 billion in  
total
sales to businesses located in North Carolina, provided $780.8  
million in
personal income to workers in North Carolina, and supported 23,782  
jobs in
the state."

       As you well know North Carolina's fisheries resources have been
considerably hindered by blatant misuse through commercial  
overfishing and
destructive gear practices. There is irrefutable scientific data  
available
though our North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries and Atlantic  
States
Marine Fisheries Council website(s) that supports the overwhelming
degredation of our fish stocks concerning trout and red drum, our state
fish.

      As one of over 400,000 resident licensed coastal recreational  
anglers I
urge you to support the Coastal Game Fish Act Bill H918. It is time  
North
Carolina's fisheries management caught up with the rest of the Atlantic
States and offered more to it's resident and visiting anglers.

Sincerely,

Ron GIlbert

Governor Perdue;

   My name is Michael Daniels, I am a registered democrat in Beaufort County and I supported you with my vote in this past Novembers election. I am also an ex-commercial fisherman and an avid recreational fisherman.

   The reason for my email is I would like your support with H-918 (Game Fish Status for Speckled Trout and Red Drum), in my many travels throughout the Gulf of Mexico region I have seen firsthand what game fish status can do for the economy of a coastal state, I have also seen how many of the commercial fishermen in these states have became charter captains or guides and are now making a better living than they did as commercial fisherman.

   I feel that Game Fish Status would allow NC to become a great fishery for these species and a rival to any Gulf state for recreational fishing dollars, which would be a great boost to the NC economy.

   Thank you for your support.
