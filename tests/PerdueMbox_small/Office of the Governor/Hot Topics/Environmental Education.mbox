Dear Governor Perdue,



I am strongly opposed to the elimination of the Office of Environmental Education (EE) in DENR. This office has personally helped me in my efforts to implement environmental education at Winston-Salem State University. Students at WSSU often come underprepared in the sciences and usually have little knowledge about human impacts on the environment and sustainable use of our natural resources. Additionally, our students who are preparing to be teachers need to be well versed in environmental education so that they can help to break the cycle of ignorance in these areas.



The Office of EE has been an incredibly valuable resource for me in this endeavor. For example, in 2003, when I first informed the Office about my desire to initiate an environmental education program at WSSU, the staff immediately took a personal interest in it. They offered to come to my campus (free of charge) to make a presentation about EE to faculty and administration. I was excited about the possibility of leveraging a state-level office to persuade my colleagues to support an important addition to our curriculum. Four staff members (including the Director) of the Office of EE came to WSSU and made a two hour presentation to the Teacher Education Council of our School of Education. I was not surprised to see that most of my colleagues knew little about the scope and value of EE. The presentation resulted not only in their becoming more knowledgeable about EE, but also helped to garner their support for my efforts to make EE a part of the teacher-preparation curriculum. As a result, I have established environmental education courses and am currently in the process of developing a Second Course of Study in Environmental Education for our teacher education candidates. The Office of EE has continued to provide me with resources, materials, and personal assistance on an ongoing basis.



The Office of Environmental Education will also be a valuable resource for future initiatives at WSSU. Last summer, several of my colleagues from a variety of disciplines joined together to develop an environmental studies degree program at WSSU. Expected to be implemented in Fall 2010, this program is proposing to have three specialization tracks: environmental education, environmental entrepreneurship, and environmental policy. This program directly addresses the University of North Carolina’s UNC Tomorrow initiatives: 4.6: Our environment, 4.1: Our global readiness, and 4.3: Our Children and Their Future: Improving Public Education. It addresses the need for increasing the environmental literacy of our teacher education candidates as well as providing them with additional science coursework, preparing students to compete in the sustainable development sector of the global marketplace, and preparing students to make informed decisions about environmental policy. WSSU would be the first HBCU in North Carolina to offer such an undergraduate degree program, and thus meet important needs of underserved populations. The Office of EE will serve a key role in the development and implementation of this program. It will provide critical ongoing support and current, high-quality educational materials.



At the national level, the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) has recognized the outstanding performance of the Office of EE. You have already received a letter of support from Brian Day, NAAEE’s Executive Director. NAAEE has scheduled its annual International Conference for 2011 to be held in Raleigh, and it would be a travesty if the Office of EE were not there to spearhead the representation of North Carolina.



In reference to our distressed economy, at a time when economists agree that the environment will be a key sector in the economic recovery, it is incomprehensible that this office would be eliminated. On the contrary, it should receive greater importance so that it can further support recovery efforts. It defies logic that this office should be eliminated for economic or budgetary reasons.



Neither Winston-Salem State University nor the State of North Carolina can afford to lose this valuable resource. I certainly could not sustain my efforts in environmental education without the help of the Office of EE. Please do not allow the Office of Environmental Education to be eliminated.



Thank you for your consideration in this very important matter.



Sincerely,

Himanshu Gopalan
