Governor Perdue:

I DO NOT support the proposed tax increase on the tobacco industry.  This is an outrageous attack on a potential 50,000 jobs at a time when so many people are struggling.  

More than 50,000 jobs in North Carolina are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution and this does not include all the other jobs and lives which will be negatively impacted.  While unemployment in the state is currently at 9.7%, the Triad is facing 10.4%; the impact of this will greatly increase that.

The federal government just increased the federal tobacco tax by $.62.  It is projected by many economist that this will cause a loss of 3000 jobs and impact many more lives in NC.  Just think about the ramifications of a $1 tax increase per pack.  

This is a regressive tax which will greatly harm many people in the state.  

-55% of smokers are working poor
-One in four smokers lives below the poverty line
-Median family income of NC smokers is $33,437
-80% of smokers make less that $75,000

At a time when the economy is struggling, now is not the time to target the working people of NC.  

Please reconsider this tax increase.  It is not fair, equitable or right.  

We must protect many thousands of jobs in NC - this tax increase is a bad idea!

I know you care about getting the economy back on track.  This is not the way to do it.

Good afternoon-
My name is Jim Reitzel and I have been a resident of Guilford county for
the past 59 years and a registered Democrat since 1971.
I would like to express my dismay at the proposed State tax increase on
cigarettes.
During  a time of double digit unemployment, it simply makes no sense to
risk the probable loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
A tax increase in a time of recession is problematic at best, but to try
and alter the lifestyles of millions of NC citizens at this time can only
spell financial disaster.
I understand the reasons for the increase and perhaps in a time of
financial stability, it is a notion worth considering. But please do not
make this a defining moment for the Democratic party. We have fought too
long and too hard for the status that we claim. To drive the state further
into financial difficulty is not a legacy that we wish to leave behind us.
Thanks for your attention
Jim Reitzel

Dear Bev Perdue
    I'm a smoker and started and it's a hard thing to quit I've tried but it is something when I went to school they told us and took us on a fieldtrip in school about how tobacco built this state( I've still got the field trip photos from school). Now I feel like  I'm being punished for smoking by trying to take all my money from my family. Economy is tough and I'm a small business owner and it is tough. So why of all times are you'll trying to destroy what I've worked hard for. I feel like every right I have is being stripped caused you'll need money for something that will never help my family and we aren't talking pocket change.
    If you'll have any care for the issues of the people please let me know why I have been singled out so much for being a smoker.
         Thanks Johnny Kaylor

Sin taxes should include alcohol, pornography, escort and other adult entertainment services, sports events, high fructose foods and drinks. If you discriminate too vehemently against smokers and they take their business elsewhere, who will you profit from and exploit then?

I feel compelled to write and express my opinion on the cigarette tax increase.

When the economy is bad, one of the first choices in raising revenue is to impose a higher tax on cigarettes. 

Smoking is being banned from government buildings, restaurants, and almost all public places, including outdoor parking facilities, yet smokers are paying an increasingly high tax for the right to smoke.  Where is the equity is this taxation? 

If health care is the major concern, why not ban smoking altogether?  It is a hypocritical stance that the government takes; smoking is a dirty, costly, horrible, deadly habit, but as long as we can collect taxes and raise them as needed, w'ell allow it, and besides that point, the state needs the jobs. 

Even as this increase is announced through the news media, the tax increase is aimed at reducing the state's deficit, not earmarked for the 'cost of treating smokers' health issues'.

Why not impose an obesity tax, as obesity and 'heart health' have become premier health concerns?

If the economy is in such flux as tax increases are deemed necessary, why would smoker's have any more discretionary income than any one else in the state?  A person smoking an average of a pack of cigarettes a day would incur at least a $30 increase a month for the right to smoke.

I think the government is once again unfairly riding the backs of smokers.  The government is more concerned about the revenue that can be generated from cigarette taxes, rather than the health of smokers.

Governor Perdue:

I DO NOT support the proposed tax increase on the tobacco industry.  This is an outrageous attack on a potential 50,000 jobs at a time when so many people are struggling.  

More than 50,000 jobs in North Carolina are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution and this does not include all the other jobs and lives which will be negatively impacted.  While unemployment in the state is currently at record levels; the impact of this will greatly increase that.

The federal government just increased the federal tobacco tax by $.62.  It is projected by many economist that this will cause a loss of 3000 jobs and impact many more lives in NC.  Just think about the ramifications of a $1 tax increase per pack.  

This is a regressive tax which will greatly harm many people in the state.  

-55% of smokers are working poor
-One in four smokers lives below the poverty line
-Median family income of NC smokers is $33,437

The federal government just increased the federal tobacco tax by $.62.  It is projected by many economist that this will cause a loss of 3000 jobs and impact many more lives in NC.  Just think about the ramifications of a $1 tax increase per pack.  

This is a regressive tax which will greatly harm many people in the state.  

-55% of smokers are working poor
-One in four smokers lives below the poverty line
-Median family income of NC smokers is $33,437
-80% of smokers make less that $75,000

At a time when the economy is struggling, now is not the time to target the working people of NC.  

Please reconsider this tax increase.  It is not spur job creation, is not fair, equitable or right.  

We must protect many thousands of jobs in NC - this tax increase is a bad idea!

I know you care about getting the economy back on track.  This is not the way to do it.

Governor Perdue:

I DO NOT support the proposed tax increase on the tobacco industry.  This is an outrageous attack on a potential 50,000 jobs at a time when so many people are struggling.  

More than 50,000 jobs in North Carolina are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution and this does not include all the other jobs and lives which will be negatively impacted.  While unemployment in the state is currently at record levels; the impact of this will greatly increase that.

The federal government just increased the federal tobacco tax by $.62.  It is projected by many economist that this will cause a loss of 3000 jobs and impact many more lives in NC.  Just think about the ramifications of a $1 tax increase per pack.  

This is a regressive tax which will greatly harm many people in the state.  

-55% of smokers are working poor
-One in four smokers lives below the poverty line
-Median family income of NC smokers is $33,437
-80% of smokers make less that $75,000

At a time when the economy is struggling, now is not the time to target the working people of NC.  

Please reconsider this tax increase.  It is not spur job creation, is not fair, equitable or right.  

We must protect many thousands of jobs in NC - this tax increase is a bad idea!

I know you care about getting the economy back on track.  This is not the way to do it.

As a citizen of this State and the United States of America, I am very concerned.  The issues surrounding tobacco have gone beyond reason, from taxes to loss of freedom.  I thought our Constitutions were to protect ALL citizens, but evidently they do not.  Each day I am realizing that we are losing our freedom.  I have to speak out against the proposed tax increase on cigarettes and the proposed ban.  And, whether I am a smoker or not, I firmly believe it should not be up to the government to dictate what citizens or businesses can and cannot do when something is not against the law.  The government is not running the establishments, paying the taxes on the establishments, or working the establishments.  With regard to choice, non-smokers already have more rights and choices.  More and more businesses and eating establishments are going smoke free, which is their choice.  And, non-smokers have a choice to visit those establishments.  If a non-smoker goes into an estalbishment that is not smoke free, then smokers should not be penalized for it.  And, if someone chooses to work in a smoking establishment, that is their choice and smokers should not be penalized for it.  They do not have to work there.  But the government is singling out a group of citizens and taking away freedom and not giving them a choice as non-smokers currently have, and that should not happen.  What makes a smoker less of a citizen than a non-smoker?  And why should smokers bear such a large tax in addition to taxes they already pay?  It is just not fair and smokers are being discriminated against.  Non-smokers have a choice, as should smokers.  Smoke is not the only harmful thing to people.  In fact, daily we are confronted with something that is harmful and if one listened to everything in the news one would have to live in a bubble and not live life.  Citizens are at risk of being faced with something harmful every day, from the purchase of food products, to the loss of life from a drunk driver or someone on drugs which affect the mind.  One has to have faith and live life as they choose to, but ultimaely, it should not be the government chosing how a citizen should live life.  Are we really headed to socialism?  I surely hope not.  If yet another tax on cigarettes and the ban are passed, what is next?  I fear this is merely a stepping stone to complete goverment control.  And I pray the ones I helped to elect to serve our State and Country listen to my concerns as a citizen, and speak up for me.


Thank you for your time.  Patricia Welborn
