Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to request that the State of North Carolina deny
Duke Energy's request to re-classify the new coal-fired unit,
"Unit-6", as a minor source of hazardous air pollutants.

I am concerned that Duke's request to simply redefine the new
coal-fired unit at Cliffside in no way protects public health
and Great Smoky Mountains National Park from the facility's
hazardous pollution. This permitting decision is critical to
North Carolina and the region's air quality and merits full and
fair opportunity for the public to be heard on this issue.
Our energy choices impact our lungs and our state?s most
important natural area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Permitting a dirty coal-fired power plant in North Carolina will
harm those things that I care about most: my family's health,
the health of the Smokies, and our air quality. I think North
Carolina can do better and therefore request that the state
provide ample opportunity for public hearings on the issue of
redefining "Unit-6" as a minor polluter. I sincerely hope that
the State denies Duke Energy's request.

I urge you to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy
choices for North Carolina. Protect the health of North
Carolina's parks and people! Deny Duke Energy's Minor Source
application! Thank you for considering my views.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to request that the State of North Carolina deny
Duke Energy's request to re-classify the new coal-fired unit,
"Unit-6", as a minor source of hazardous air pollutants.

I am concerned that Duke's request to simply redefine the new
coal-fired unit at Cliffside in no way protects public health
and Great Smoky Mountains National Park from the facility's
hazardous pollution. This permitting decision is critical to
North Carolina and the region's air quality and merits full and
fair opportunity for the public to be heard on this issue.
Our energy choices impact our lungs and our state?s most
important natural area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Permitting a dirty coal-fired power plant in North Carolina will
harm those things that I care about most: my family's health,
the health of the Smokies, and our air quality. I think North
Carolina can do better and therefore request that the state
provide ample opportunity for public hearings on the issue of
redefining "Unit-6" as a minor polluter. I sincerely hope that
the State denies Duke Energy's request.

I urge you to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy
choices for North Carolina. Protect the health of North
Carolina's parks and people! Deny Duke Energy's Minor Source
application! Thank you for considering my views.

As a native North Carolinian I'm appalled. Duke makes us all
look bad. My experience growning up and living here is that
North Carolinians do care a great deal about the environment,
but that they trust too much. They trust big companies to do the
right thing. But Duke Power isn't earning our trust by lying to
us about Cliffside. There is no way in the world that this new
coal fired unit can be considered anything other than a major
polluter. Shame on Duke Power for lying to us. And to you.

"Unit-6", as a minor source of hazardous air pollutants.

I am concerned that Duke's request to simply redefine the new
coal-fired unit at Cliffside in no way protects public health
and Great Smoky Mountains National Park from the facility's
hazardous pollution. This permitting decision is critical to
North Carolina and the region's air quality and merits full and
fair opportunity for the public to be heard on this issue.
Our energy choices impact our lungs and our state?s most
important natural area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Permitting a dirty coal-fired power plant in North Carolina will
harm those things that I care about most: my family's health,
the health of the Smokies, and our air quality. I think North
Carolina can do better and therefore request that the state
provide ample opportunity for public hearings on the issue of
redefining "Unit-6" as a minor polluter. I sincerely hope that
the State denies Duke Energy's request.

I urge you to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy
choices for North Carolina. Protect the health of North
Carolina's parks and people! Deny Duke Energy's Minor Source
application! Thank you for considering my views.

I'm writing to request that the State of North Carolina deny
Duke Energy's request to re-classify the new coal-fired unit,
"Unit-6", as a minor source of hazardous air pollutants.

I am concerned that Duke's request to simply redefine the new
coal-fired unit at Cliffside in no way protects public health
and Great Smoky Mountains National Park from the facility's
hazardous pollution. This permitting decision is critical to
North Carolina and the region's air quality and merits full and
fair opportunity for the public to be heard on this issue.
Our energy choices impact our lungs and our state?s most
important natural area, Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Permitting a dirty coal-fired power plant in North Carolina will
harm those things that I care about most: my family's health,
the health of the Smokies, and our air quality. I think North
Carolina can do better and therefore request that the state
provide ample opportunity for public hearings on the issue of
redefining "Unit-6" as a minor polluter. I sincerely hope that
the State denies Duke Energy's request.

I urge you to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy
choices for North Carolina. Protect the health of North
Carolina's parks and people! Deny Duke Energy's Minor Source
application! Thank you for considering my views.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Governor Perdue:

This is why you were elected. North Carolinians need you to
protect the state from the enterprise of corporations not
looking out for the greater welfare of the state. This includes
new coal infrastructure - infrastructure that does not move us
closer to a safe environment.
