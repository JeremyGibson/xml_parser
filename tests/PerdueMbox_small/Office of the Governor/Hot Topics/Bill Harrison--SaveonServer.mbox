Subject: education

Comment: This falderol of appointing Mr. Harrison to some education position (title) is PR only and is a useless charade. We already have a supt of education and every governor in my lifetime has claimed to be the education governor. Another title is not needed and the governor's statements about clear lines of authority and accountability are nothing more than vapid.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would like to tell you that I do not agree with your creation of the CEO of Education job. What public education needs is less government intervention, not more. We already have an elected Supt. of Public Education, don't we? I think this was a big mistake to start off your administration. Thank you for your time and consideration. Aaron Clarke

Subject: Superintendent of education position

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I think it is fiscally irresponsible to appoint Bill Harrison as Chief of the State Board of Education when we have a Superintendent who is supposed to be the chief officer of the State Board of Education. In this time of financial stress we don't need the paying two people for a position. The people who voted for Auperintendent Atkinson believed that she would be the "chief". If this is not the case let's then I think the public needs to understand this and perhaps we should either get rid of this position or endow it with the powers that the people believe it has. Respectfully, Marilyn Bailey

Subject: State Dept of Public Instruction

Comment: You named Dr. Bill Harrison to serve as both CEO of our stateâ€™s public schools and Chair of the State Board. This position pays what? I believe that I have read over $200,000. Was June Atkinson not elected by the people of NC to lead the Dept of Public Instruction? When we are in a budget crisis, why pay this Mr. Harrison over $200,000 when we already have a leader of our Dept of Public Instruction? I am in need of a job and cannot find one. If you have any more jobs available, I can start tomorrow.

Subject: Newly Created Position of CEO of Schools

Comment: Dear Gov. Purdue In a time of finicial crisis like most of us have not seen in our life time, when people across the state are losing jobs and homes and everything they have worked so hard for all their lives; can you explain to me the need for this position at the rate of pay that Mr Harrison has been promised. I think the taxpayers across NC are entitled to know why their taxes are going up to pay for for decision that don't pass the common sense rule for most people. The whole issue has a sour smell to me and many more North Carolinians.

Subject: CEO of Education

Comment: Please explain to me why we need a 6 figure CEO of Education when we already have an elected official that is over education? I do not agree with this sort of politics of spending $$$$ when we are already in such financial difficulty. And I don't understand why the Governor can appoint someone to over-ride what the public has done through the voting process. If this is the way it is going to be, then WHY VOTE??? It sounds a little socialist to me!!
