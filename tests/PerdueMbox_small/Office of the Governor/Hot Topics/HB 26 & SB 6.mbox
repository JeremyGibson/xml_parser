Governor Perdue,
My husband and I are retired educators residing in Kure Beach.  We are extremely concerned about the proposed rate increases in homeowners insurance along the coastal areas of our beautiful state.  We are asking that you give your support to Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26 and help keep homeowners living expenses within reason.
Thank you,
Virginia Price

Dear Governor Perdue,
As a resident of Lee County who also owns property in New Hanover County I am writing to you to ask that you support House BIll 26 and Senate Bill 6.  I am deeply concerned about the approved 2009 insurance rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.  House Bill 26 and Senate Bill 6 call for a stay in execution of the Beach Plan increases and would allow for public debate and development of plans to minimize the economic impacts on beach property owners.  Our beaches are an invaluable asset to our entire state and the economic benefits from the coast benefit all North Carolinians. Just as the benefits are shared by all North Carolinians so should be the risks.  Storms do not affect just our coastline.  Interior counties have historically been affected, too,.  The only insurance claim I ever made for property damage was made for my Lee County residence after Hurricane Fran, not my property in New Hanover County. 
I thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter and hopefully, for your support on this issue.
Sincerely,
Carol Stewart

To the Honorable Governor Bev Perdue:

Dear Governor Perdue:

I am shocked to learn about the approved insurance rate adjustments to
the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies. The significant
rate increases, coupled with the Wind and Hail deductibles, are
unbelievable. The rates should be borne by all of the state; not just
the coastal inhabitants. I urge you to support Senate Bill 6 and House
Bill 26. Please veto any increases!

I live on a fixed income and with today’s economy, I may have to sell my
small town home and leave the wonderful North Carolina coast. Of course,
with the current state of our economy, I may not be able to sell.
Regardless, I am now leaning towards leaving North Carolina and live
where I can afford to pay for the insurance protection.

I genuinely hope this outrageous adjustment will be stayed permanently.
Considering the devaluation of our property, the rates should be reduced
not increased.

Respectfully,

Johnny P. Lingo

Dear Governor, Senators, and Representatives,

RE: Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26

Coastal storms cause damage to many more properties than just those along the coast,  so it is inequitable that the burden of insurance rate increases be borne solely by the coastal residents of NC.  All North Carolinians share in the benefits from having a beautiful coast line.  The obvious recreational value and generated  jobs and revenues along the coast are among North Carolina's greatest economic assets. The NC coast belongs to the entire state; therefore the risk should be shared by all North Carolinians.     Please, support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.

Respectfully,

Charles W. Rhode

Dear Governor Bev Perdue,

Thank you for being our Governor. I am a registert voter and I voted for you.

As a Kure Beach Resident I am very concerned about the approved 2009 insurance rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.

As you know, the coastal areas of North Carolina are a treasure and an asset to our entire state.Aside from the obvious recreational value the NC Coast is one of the greatest economic assets we have.The revenue and jobs generated on the Coast benefit all residents of North Carolina. 

I feel it is  inequitable that the entire burden of insurance rate increases is born by the coastal counties. Damages and claims from storms have not been limited to our area. iI feel that the risk should be shared.

I want to ask you please support Senate Bill 6 and house Bill 26.



Sincerely

Bettina Graham

Dear Governor  Perdue,

I am writing to you as a homeowner in Kure Beach or at least I am at the moment. I feel it is inequitable that the burden of the recently proposed insurance rate increase be borne if not entirely almost entirely by the coastal  counties. I will not be able to continue my beach residence if this in fact happens. In this time of real estate slow down, I probably will not be able to sell. My choice is to let it go into default and become an eye sore. I am so exhausted with it that having that situation is no longer offensive to me.

I ask that you support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26. You know, the entire state of North Carolina benefits from the beach not just the residents of beach towns!

Thank you, Guy and Carol Willetts

Dear Governor Perdue,

We urgently need your help in support of Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26. We can not afford another insurance rate increase.  I believe that recent history will show damages and claims from storms are not simply a coastal problem.  The first year we owned our house, our insurance was about four hundred dollars - after we were forced to have Wind & Hail through NCIAU, last year it was over two thousand dollars.

Please help people to stay in their homes.

Thank you.

Please support senate bill 6, and house bill 26.  Remember the NC coast belongs to the entire state and the economic benefits from the Coast benefit all North Carolinians.

Our economy is in a very fragile state, people are losing their homes, how can they afford another increase in insurance.  Other states have placed hotel
taxes on their vacation areas to increase revenue.  Last year we went to Arizona and paid a 39% hotel tax.  The beach area belongs to everyone it is clearly visible during the vacation periods from June to Sept.  Please look for
other avenues to obtain revenue rather than from the citizens who live in these beach areas.
Thank you for your assistance in this very important matter.

Dear Governor,

My name is Johnny Yuen and I have been a NC residence since 1985 and a small business operator since 1991.

I have read from newspaper recently about the 2009 insurance rate adjustments to the NC Beach Plan and Homeowner Policies.  The rate could be elevated between 20-30%. This will be devastating to the our beach communities which has already been hampered by the economic downturn. Please realize that our coast is a major tourist attraction for many snow birds from the North and has been contributing to the state coffer. The economic benefits from the coast benefit all North Carolinians.

Please support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  I appreciate your attention to this matter.



Sincerely,

Johnny Yuen

My husband and I own a home in Carolina Beach, NC and just received notice that a possible increase may occur. We cannot continue to make the payments and with the higher (home assessed at the highest peak)  and suddenly we find that the insurance may be raised at least 17 percent or more. With the economy going South, loss of jobs, do you really want this to happen? NC may very well find themselves in their own crisis simply because you are not taking care of the citizens that live and pay taxes. Now you want more. Our home is worth less than what we purchased it for and trying our best to keep afloat.  Enough is enough. How in the world can this even be considered. And if so, why is it the coastal communities are affected when the entire State benefits from our revenue?  Tax all owners. This is unfair and affects only those that live in the coastal area. If this is not discrimination, I don't know what is.  Or you can do this, tell those that are not paying the insurance that they cannot use the coast.  If so, tax them for using the coast.  Just trying to make a point.

I am asking that you support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26. 

NC will find more and more homeowners bailing out of the State if this continues. It is already ridiculous that assessments occur every four years leaving us with taxes on a home that is now worth half the price.   We will be one of those families that will immediately ensure that we are no longer citizens of NC. You will find that many will sell or leave their home (then no tax base) and many will not want to even live there because NC has made it too difficult to want to live there.

Dear Governor Purdue,

When I voted for you in November I never thought I'd be e-mailing you four
months later.

I am asking for your support for Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  The NC
coast belongs to the entire state and the economic benefits from the coast
benefit all North Carolinians.  It is inequitable that the entire burden of
insurance rate increases is borne by the coastal counties.  Recent history
shows that damages and claims from storms have not been limited to my area
(Kure Beach).  Simply stated - risk should be shared!

Your consideration and support in this matter is greatly appreciated.
Continued success!

Subject: North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies

Dear Ms. Perdue:

I am deeply concerned about the approved 2009 rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.  The proposed rate increases will have a significant impact on my and my neighbors' finances, in a time where all of us have very challenging budgetary issues.  Unlike many homeowners in North Carolina's beach and resort areas, I am a full-time resident in Kure Beach, living in my primary and only residence.  Any increases in my already inflated monthly mortgage and escrow collections will cause a hardship in my household.

In a time where taxpayers like me are paying for the bailout of major banks and corporations, the last thing we need is more payouts.  I am quite certain that many homeowners in this state will be availing of benefits of banks' economic stimulus package funds to assist them in their mortgages and other finances.  Just as I will pay my share for this, it is only fair that the burden of insurance rate increases is carried by the entire state, as recent history has proven that damages and claims from storm occur in numerous regions around the state, not just the coastline.  The entire state benefits from the economic assets of the coastal regions, why should they also share the liabilities?

I implore you to support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26 and ease the burden on the NC coastal residents of this highly inequitable increase in our policies.

Respectfully,

It is most inequitable that the entire burden of insurance rate increase be borne by the coastal counties.  Recent history shows that damages and claims from storms are not limited to coastal areas.  It is important o keep the coastal areas as a treasure to all who enjoy them. I have written to New Hanover senators and representatives asking their support of Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.

Elected Officials,

I am a resident of Wake County and a homeowner of Kure Beach.  I am asking for your support for Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  One of the many perks of living in North Carolina is having the coast and mountains an easy commute for day trips. The coast belongs to the entire state and the economic benefits from the Coast benefit all North Carolinians. As a resident of Wake County we have had a fare share of devastating storms come through our area and not our coast. How is it any different.  Rate increases should be shared equally as the risks are.  If you enforce this rate increase  our residents at the coast will no longer be able to afford to keep their homes. Both Wake and New Hanover County have had new tax valuations within the last 2 years, and if the homes are selling at all they are selling well below these new tax values. With the proposed insurance increase it will be even more difficult for homeowners to afford their ! homes. 

If we are going to rebuild the economy in North Carolina it will need to start with Real Estate. Consumers are not going to buy coastal properties when tax values and insurance premiums are continually rising.

Thanks for all you do in helping North Carolina continue to be the great state it is. 

Thank You,
Mike and Kim Carlton

Elected Officials,

We are residents of Wake County and homeowners at Surf City.  We are asking for your support for Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  One of the many perks of living in North Carolina is having the coast and mountains as easy commutes for day trips. The coast belongs to the entire state and the economic benefits from the coast benefit all North Carolinians. As residents of Wake County, we have had a more than a few devastating storms hit our area and not our coast…so how is it any different?  Rate increases should be shared equally as the risks are.  If you enforce this rate increase, our residents at the coast will no longer be able to afford to keep their homes. Wake, Pender and New Hanover counties have had new tax valuations within the last 2 years, and if the homes are selling at all, they are selling well below the new tax values. With the proposed insurance increase, it will be even more difficult for homeowners to afford to keep their homes, much less purchase them. 

If we are going to rebuild the economy in North Carolina, it will need to start with real estate. Consumers are not going to buy coastal properties when tax values and insurance premiums are continually rising at incredibly high rates.

Thanks for all you do in helping North Carolina continue to be the great state it is.

I am writing you as a citizen of North Carolina to ask for your help with the recent.  It is difficult as it is to afford vacations at the wonderful beaches in North Carolina and I feel that the recent rate adjustments to the NC Beach and Plan and Homeowners Policies are not only unjustified, but will keep many in NC from being able to enjoy our coast in these very difficult economic times.  I would appreciate any support you could give to Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26 which help stop these increases.

Dear Honorable Perdue:    

Please support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  The economic impact to the entire state may hinge on the passing of these 2 bills.

The residents of Coastal Carolina should not brunt the burden of any more insurance rate increases.  The Coast belongs to everyone and if we look into the statistics, it will show that storm damage affects many areas Not specifically on the coast.

The coastal areas of North Carolina are a treasure and an asset to our entire state.  Aside from the obvious recreational value the NC Coast is one of the greatest economic assets we have.  The revenue and jobs generated on the Coast benefit all residents of North Carolina.

I feel it is inequitable that the entire burden of insurance rate increases is borne by the coastal counties.  Recent history shows that damages and claims from storms have not been limited to our area.  In fact, other areas have suffered immeasurably.  I feel that the risk should be shared.

I ask that you support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  Remember that the NC Coast belongs to the entire state.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Dear Governor, Senator and Representatives:
I am emailing to ask your support of Senate Bill 6 & House Bill 26 which will stay the execution of the beach plan  and homeowners insurance rate increases until public debate and plans to minimize its impact on coastal property owners can be developed.  The beaches of NC are a benefit enjoyed by our entire state as well as an economic asset.  The revenues and jobs generated on the coast benefit all residents of NC.  It is not fair or realistic to ask coastal property owners to be responsibile for all the insurance rate increases; some of that expense must be borne by the beach visitors.

Honorable Elected Officials,

Last year we weathered our eight year New Hanover County property revaluation. The revaluation was completed at the peak of real estate speculation craze for this area and neither banks nor realtors will appraise our property at a value even near what the County did...., there appears to be no recourse.....but I digress. I will pay my taxes, it is the law..

Now we learn that the property we purchased  here in Kure Beach is either so valuable or so dangerous that the NC Commissioner of Insurance feels the need to increase our property insurance rates by approximately 40% in one year! For a period of....eternity?  What sort of increase can we expect to see next year? How could past underwriters have been so terribly wrong? How could agents have underestimated our property values by so much? Will our claims even be paid by the insurance company if we do suffer a hurricane (look to New Orleans and Galveston if you require an answer)? Why is the homeowner held responsible for the ineptitude of  the insurer? Where did our past premiums go? How many more homes will be foreclosed on because of these increases? These are not rhetorical questions. Your comments are welcome.....

I already have five abandoned homes on my street (over 3400 sf ea). How much revenue will the County, Banks or Insurance Company generate from them?

Homeowners Insurance and Property Taxes are not optional expenses. This is shelter. You know.....shelter?

I support NC House Bill 26!

Please, allow us to stay in North Carolina.

Sincerely,

One of the few who can still afford to live here legally,

Dear Governor Purdue
As a resident of the NC coast I am greatly alarmed at the proposal of the insurance industry to limit coverage as well as increase my premiums at a higher percentage than the rest of the state.  I live in an area that swells with visitation from Mar to November with people from all over the state as well as neighboring states.  The coastal region is a beautiful resource enjoyed by all NC residents.  I feel we would be paying an unfair amount if the insurance companies are permitted to increase our premiums without increasing all residents across the state equally.  History proves that weather catastrophes have effected areas inland as much and sometimes more than the coastal region.  I urge you to use all your influence to make insurance policies fair throughout the state.

I’m a full time resident of the North Carolina coast, a resident without investment property where upon insurance rate increases can be passed on in the form of higher rents. I am urging you to please support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26, which would stay the rate increases to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.  This would allow time for your office to work with the General Assembly to develop alternative plans to minimize the economic impact on coastal residents.

Dear Mss Justice, Boseman and Perdue:

I sure hope that you realize that there is no such thing as 'Hurricane Insurance' and the policies to which I am referring are Wind and Hail and Flood Insurance.  I would like very much to be kept current on the Caucus' activities, as I am directly effected by these decisions.  More importantly, I am interested in the activities of the NC House, Senate and Governor's Office on this matter.  Like many homeowners on the coast, my home exceeds the $150,000 value you stated in your message below and protecting the first $150,000 in value simply is NOT the desirable solution.

Please forgive my criticism, but your reply message is not very clear and does not allay my concerns.  Your mention of the statewide proposal should be a no-brainer - why would any legislator vote against a bill that benefits everyone?  After all, the coastal region is not the only region in our state that is vulnerable to flooding, wind and hail.  Anyone who lives anywhere near a river or large body of water is vulnerable.  Who can deny that the effects and damages from hurricanes effect everyone in their path, inland and coast alike?  YOU must reason with your fellow legislators to help them understand this.  Lest we forget the damages caused by the remnants of hurricanes in the western region of our state in years past, they must surely understand the potential of this recurrence.  Additionally, you mention that you must examine the criteria by which the increase was calculated.  Does not the NC Insurance Commissioner's office have the facts and figures of this criteria?  Did the commissioner's office rubber stamp this proposal?  I need answers to these questions.

Isn't it time that you and the other legislators in Raleigh stand up for your constituents and take on the insurance industry?  If what you are stating is true, this is tantamount to extortion by the insurance companies, that is, the threat of cancelling all policies in North Carolina.  We are depending on YOU to protect us from this!!  Now, take this opportunity to earn your pay and our votes by representing and protecting us from this threat, which is far greater that any hurricane we have had over the past several years.

Please respond to me on these topics at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully,

Steven A. Salke

> Dear Ms. Justice:

I am deeply concerned about the approved 2009 rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.  The proposed rate increases will have a significant impact on my and my neighbors' finances, in a time where all of us have very challenging budgetary issues.  Unlike many homeowners in North Carolina's beach and resort areas, I am a full-time resident in Kure Beach, living in my primary and only residence.  Any increases in my already inflated monthly mortgage and escrow collections will cause a hardship in my household.

In a time where taxpayers like me are paying for the bailout of major banks and corporations, the last thing we need is more payouts.  I am quite certain that many homeowners in this state will be availing of benefits of banks' economic stimulus package funds to assist them in their mortgages and other finances.  Just as I will pay my share for this, it is only fair that the burden of insurance rate increases is carried by the entire state, as recent history has proven that damages and claims from storm occur in numerous regions around the state, not just the coastline.  The entire state benefits from the economic assets of the coastal regions, why shouldn't they also share the liabilities?

I implore you to support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26 and ease the burden on the NC coastal residents of this highly inequitable increase in our policies.

Respectfully,

Dear Governor Purdue,

As I am sure you are aware, we that live along the beaches of North Carolina have been informed that our insurance rates will increase by as high as 17%.  Wind and Hail deductibles will increase by 2%.  This is extremely unfair to us for the following reasons:
* Although insurance rates at beach towns will dramatically increase, insurance rates will go down in other parts of North Carolina.  Many people from those areas vacation at our beaches.  They enjoy our beaches. They get the benefit of our beaches. Isn't it fair that they should help defray our high insurance costs?
* Many tourists visit our beaches from other states.  This is a major source of revenue for North Carolina.  We that live in beach towns are being penalized for it because of the higher insurance rates.
* While beach towns are being penalized, other parts of the state have had to cope with hurricane destruction but their rates are not going up.  I have seen the damage first hand when Hugo battered Charlotte in 1998 and Fran did the same in Raleigh in 1996.  Is it fair that insurance rates are not going up in areas that have been hit with storms such as Hugo and Fran?
* Some businesses along our beaches may not be able to afford to stay open due to the new rates.  Their livelihood will disappear if they can no longer keep their doors open.
* If some restaurants, gift shops, etc are forced out of business by the insurance increases, tourism is sure to go down.  That means their will be fewer tax dollars flowing into state and local coffers.
* People thinking about moving to our beach towns may change their mind because of the high rate of insurance.  Many potential residents come from other states might also change their minds about moving to North Carolina.  Again less revenue for the state.
* Current beach town residents are asking themselves if they can afford to keep their homes due to the increase insurance rates.  In today's economy, this is a major financial setback for all us trying to hold on.  The problem is that we folks living in beach towns are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  We would not be able to sell our homes because no one is buying.  So, we are stuck.  We have no choice but to buckle up and pay.
That being said, I urge you to support Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 26.  It is clearly the right think to do.

Respectfully,
Robert Falco
Kure Beach Home Owner & Resident

 Dear Governor Perdue,

    I'm contacting you because of my concerns over the proposed tax increase and ask that you support Senate Bill 6 and                                        

    House  Bill 26.  As a resident of Kure Beach I feel that the NC Coast belongs to the entire state and that the economic

    benefits from the Coast benefit ALL North Carolinians.  The proposed rate increase will have a significant impact on my

    taxes and my fellow residents in Kure and Carolina Beach.


    Thank you for your consideration,

    Bonnie Davis

TO ALL IT MAY CONCERN;

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NC COAST BELONGS TO THE ENTIRE STATE AND THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE COAST BENEFIT  ALL NORTH CAROLINIANS. WE FEEL IT IS INEQUITABLE THAT THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF INSURANCE RATE INCREASES  IS BORNE  BY THE THE COASTAL COUNTIES. RECENT HISTORY SHOWS THAT DAMAGES AND CLAIMS FROM STORMS HAVE NOT BEEN LIMITED TO OUR AREA ALONE. IN FACT, OTHER AREAS HAVE SUFFERED IMMEASURABLY. WE FEEL THAT THE RISK SHOULD BE SHARED. WE THEREFORE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT SENATE BILL 6 AND HOUSE BILL 26. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN ADVANCE.

                               SINCERELY,

Dear Governor Perdue, Rep. Blue, Rep. Avila, Rep. Martin, Rep. Ross, & Sen. Malone:

Approval of HB 26 and S6 will Stay Beach Plan increases and will allow time for public debate.  Thank you for your support and for seeking appropriate support for these bills:

Senate Bill 6 <http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S6v1.pdf>http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S6v1.pdf    (Beach Plan and Ins. Rate
                   and Deductible Stay) referred to Com. on  Commerce on 1/29/2009 and
House Bill 26 <http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/House/PDF/H26v1.pdf>http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/House/PDF/H26v1.pdf    (Stay Beach Plan Rates,
                    Deductible, Surcharges) referred to Com. on Insurance on 2/12/2009, if favorable to Judiciary II


The NC Coast belongs to all of us.  I do not own property at the beach, but property owners at the beach should not bear the entire burden for damages that have been incurred as the result of various storms.  These storms have caused damages to many areas around the state, not just to beach properties.  It is simply not appropriate to target insurance rate increases only to beach property owners. 

Any insurance rate increases should be reviewed and dealt with on a statewide basis, in an equitable manner, when rate increases relate to an area that is clearly a benefit to the entire state. 

Approval of Senate Bill 6 and/or House Bill 26 should provide an opportunity for public debate on this matter. Thank you.
