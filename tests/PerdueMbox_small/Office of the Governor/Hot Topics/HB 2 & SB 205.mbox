Subject: Support Public Health - VOTE YES on HB 2/SB 205

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Every workplace - including restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and other public places should be smoke-free. Most people work eight-hour shifts - if thirty minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack - think about what eight hours can do! Smoke-free laws are simple, strong and fair. By supporting a strong law that protects all workers we provide an equal footing to all businesses and employees. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Smoke-free laws result in a healthier workforce, greater productivity, and healthcare costs savings. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts. Sincerely, Gwendolyn Hooper 912 Woodruff Ave Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5352

There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. To Stan, Walter, Hugh and last but not least Beverly, Last year in Davidson County our Healthy Carolineans task force spearheaded an initiative to help resturaunts go smoke free. Over and over again, we heard from owners that they were afraid to lose business. Over and over again, we heard from owners who had gone smoke fee how much it had helped their business. For those on the bubble of trying to make their eating establishments smoke-free many stated that they wished the state would mandate smoke-free public places. This would take the scrutiny off the individual owners and allow them to implement a policy many owners wish to implement but can't seem to get over the hump. Your support of HB 2/SB 205 will help many businesses already considering smoking bands join the many who have already benefited from this healthy change. Thank-you for your time, Tom Doyle, MS Thomasville Medical Center Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts. Sincerely, Tom Doyle PO Box 789 Thomasville, NC 27361-0789

Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts.

Subject: Support Public Health - VOTE YES on HB 2/SB 205

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to leave a restaurant with thier clothes smelling like cigarette smoke. I have stopped eating out as much in part due to the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke in most places not to mention the harmfull effects of second hand smoke. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts.

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. As a non-smoker whose health has been threatened, whose comfort has been disturbed by the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke, and whose rights to breathe clean air and not to be disturbed and poisoned by something that is clearly poisonous, has no benefit whatsoever, and just as addictive as many other illegal drugs, has been ignored and trampled by people who choose to not only harm themselves, but also harm others around them, I am urging you to support efforts to ban smoking not only in enclosed places, but *every public place*, including open air locations. It is illegal to have sex in public, which, for all intents and purposes does not harm anyone. Yet, it has been perfectly acceptable for people to use this highly poisonous, highly addictive drug, and harm and inconvenience others around them for too long. I urge you to look at the issue objectively for I am confident that you will agree that non-smokers have historically gotten the short end of the stick in this matter - paying for others' selfish habit with their own health, comfort, and tax dollars. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts.

A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Smoke-free laws result in a healthier workforce, greater productivity, and healthcare costs savings. This bill is well drafted and should not be amended. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts. Sincerely, Gregg Stave 101 Stoneridge Pl Chapel Hill, NC 27514-9775

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Every workplace - including restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and other public places should be smoke-free.

I had a severe hemorrhagic stroke which caused my disability retirement and major expense to Medicare, and severely limited my quality of life. I feel the cigarette smoke was a strong contributor to my stroke and a major expense to our health care system.

You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Every workplace - including restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and other public places should be smoke-free. Most people work eight-hour shifts - if thirty minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack - think about what eight hours can do! Smoke-free laws are simple, strong and fair. By supporting a strong law that protects all workers we provide an equal footing to all businesses and employees. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Smoke-free laws result in a healthier workforce, greater productivity, and healthcare costs savings. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts.
