Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.


Sincerely,

worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

Only a psychopath would enjoy watching dogs fight to the death. 

The &quot;1 in 25 people is a psychopath&quot; statistic is
real. The question is: What are you going to do about it?

Outlaw dog-fighting now!

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.

Help. More of these dogs must be spayed or nuetered. These sick
people must be stoped.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task

professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

This cruel and bloody sport is overdue for elimination. Stronger
sentences for those involved in this horrible activity would
help as well as outreach education for communities.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the

As an animal lover, I cannot for the life of me understand how

dog fighters should be punished and laws need to be changed.
I read about animal abuse and the abusers when caught get no

to years in prison. Please do something about this. Thank-you.

prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

It's important to crack down on dog fighting.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.

This may seem way down your list of priorities with economic and

several dogs, I think it is time that this kind of crime be
stopped once and for all. It's been said that you can tell a lot
about a society by the way it treats its animals. With this sort
of thing continuing, what does it say about the consciousness in
this country? It is raising in general, I believe, including in
the area of government. This is just another area we need to
shore up as well.

As a NC certified substance abuse counselor, I know for certain
that a lot of drug and weapon trades are involved in dog
fighting. Dog fighting brings thousands of dollars to fighters
who also are drug and weapon dealers.
In addition, small and non-aggressive dogs are used blood bait
and die horribly. Cats, kittens, live chickens are often tied to
stakes while dogs tear them apart.
Many cats and dogs are stolen from owners to supply the bait.
Thank you, Pamela Gardner.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
