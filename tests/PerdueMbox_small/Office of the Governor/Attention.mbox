Subject: RE: Your Tax Increase...Thanks

Comment: Governor; I want to email you to say thanks for cutting my take home pay...again. After dodging six layoffs, a 5 day furlough, and a 2% cut in pay, you latest tax increases came right when I didn't need them. You and the liberal Democrats are responsible for reckless, uncontrolled spending, which is at the heart of these tax increases. You and the Democrat legislators are at fault. Your polls are low, because you are out of control and not honest with North Carolinians. Be prepared to suffer the political consequences.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of Rural Hope

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday joined the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center, the Golden LEAF Foundation and the N.C. Health and Wellness Trust Fund (HWTF) in announcing the first phase of grant awards for Rural Hope, a rural health care initiative designed to enable better health care delivery and job creation by assisting in the construction and expansion of rural health care facilities.

âIn many areas of our state, rural hospitals and health care facilities work on tight budgets to serve their communities. Rural Hope will ease the burden by bringing health care and jobs to rural communities across North Carolina,â said Perdue. âI commend the North Carolina Rural Center, the Golden Leaf Foundation and the Health and Wellness Trust Fund for working together to support this initiative and making sure our citizens receive the help they need.â

The Rural Hope grant awards are funded by the Rural Center ($3,032,500), the Golden LEAF Foundation ($560,000) and the NC Health and Wellness Trust Fund ($226,366), and range from $32,500 to $480,000, totaling $3,818,866 for the 24 grants awarded.  The grant application required that at least one new job be located in the project building for every $12,000 in grant funds received, resulting in the creation of 310 new jobs.  Application requirements also specified that grants be matched by at least an equal amount of private and/or public funds.

Priority for Rural Hope was given to small towns with a population of less than 5,000 and unincorporated areas, and eligible health care facilities included: hospitals, urgent care centers, physician offices, hospice care, aging centers, mental health providers, physical therapy providers, free clinics, rural and community health centers, dental care, vision care and safety net providers.

North Carolina Breaks into Top 10 Nanotech States

A new study shows that North Carolina has broken into the top 10 states in the nation with the highest concentration of nanotechnology companies, <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map/>universities, research laboratories and organizations, and that Raleigh has moved into the top 5 cities designated as âNano Metroâ clusters.

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies, which is a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Pew Charitable Trusts. This is the first time North Carolina has been a top-ranked nanotechnology region.

âNanotechnology is fundamental to North Carolinaâs economic development strategy of growing jobs and building a new economy,â Perdue said. âAs one of the top 10 nanotech states, North Carolina will continue to push ahead and lead a technology sector that will change every industry and create products that will change the way we live.â

The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies and features more than 1,200 organizations across the United States that are part of the nanotechnology industry.  North Carolina joins California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas as one of the top 10 states.

Raleigh pushed out Oakland to become one of the top 5 Nano Metros.  The full study can be found here: <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map>www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map.

EMC Corp. to Make Major Expansion in Wake, Durham with 397 New Jobs

EMC Corp., a world leader in information infrastructure solutions, will expand in the Triangle, adding 397 jobs over the next five years and investing $280 million. The Fortune 200 company plans to establish a new research facility in Durham County and increase its presence in Research Triangle Park and Apex. The project is contingent upon approval of local grants from Durham city and county officials.

âInformation technology companies provide sustainable, well-paying jobs for more than 100,000 workers in North Carolina,â Perdue said. âWhen a world leader in the industry such as EMC Corp. chooses to expand here, it reinforces our message that this is the place for IT companies to do business.â

As a leading developer and provider of information infrastructure technology, solutions and services, EMC provides a foundation for organizations of all sizes to manage and secure their vast and ever-increasing quantities of information; automate their data center operations; reduce power and cooling costs; and leverage critical information for business agility and competitive advantage.  

Headquartered in Massachusetts, EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) employs more than 40,000 people worldwide, including more than 900 employees in North Carolina. The 397 new jobs will pay an overall average salary of $73,325 per year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham annual average of $57,772 and the Wake average of $43,160.

North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate. Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Townsends Adds 103 Jobs in Davie County

Townsends Inc., a leading international producer and marketer of poultry products, will expand in Davie County.  The company plans to create 103 jobs and invest $700,000 over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

âFood production and economic growth go hand in hand in North Carolina, a tradition underscored by Townsendsâ expansion in Mocksville,â Gov. Perdue said.  âCompanies like this one continue to find success and expand in our state, attracted by our high-quality workforce and business-friendly environment.â

Townsends, a 118-year-old poultry company headquartered in Delaware, supplies value-added chicken products to the domestic and international food service and retail markets.  The company has a significant presence in North Carolina with three plants located in Pittsboro, Siler City and Mocksville that employ about 1,500 people.  Additionally, the companyâs poultry operations support an extensive grower base in the local area.

The Mocksville facility, operating as Crestwood Farms, a division of Townsends, is the core of the companyâs expansion into value-added chicken products and key to its strategic growth.  The company plans to add a production line of fully cooked products, increasing its capacity by approximately 25 percent.  Currently, Crestwood Farms employs about 267 workers.

State Seeks Return of Yadkin River Flows, Hydroelectric License to the People of North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the State of North Carolina has filed papers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking return of the right to plan the use of the Yadkin River flows and the Yadkin hydroelectric project for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.

âFifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoaâs request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams because the project created jobs for up to 1,000 North Carolinians,â said Perdue.  âToday, those jobs are gone, and so is the reason for the license.â

âThe State of North Carolina is responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens,â Perdue said. âGiven the Yadkin Riverâs broad impact on the state, we believe strongly that the state is the most appropriate body to plan use of this invaluable natural resource, to help assure the regionâs municipal water supply and quality and to facilitate future growth and development.â

The Yadkin River Basin includes nearly a quarter of the stateâs 100 counties, representing 17.5 percent of its population.

The initial federal license for the Yadkin hydroelectric facilities, which expired in 2008, was granted more than 50 years ago to Alcoa Power Generating Inc. APGI developed a series of dam and hydroelectric plants to serve the industrial needs of its parent company, Alcoa Inc., namely, its aluminum smelting plant in nearby Badin, which required a significant amount of power. The facilities comprising the Yadkin Project have essentially determined how the Yadkin River flows have been used in the state for the past 100 years.

Metal Manufacturer Brings New Plant, 45 Jobs to Surry County

Central States Manufacturing Inc., a regional manufacturer of metal building components, will open a new plant in Mount Airy.  The company plans to invest more than $4.5 million and create 45 jobs.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $135,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

âNorth Carolina retains a strong presence in the manufacturing sector,â Perdue said.  âOur stateâs skilled workforce, strategic location and outstanding quality of life continue to attract growing companies such as Central States Manufacturing.â

Central States Manufacturing Inc., headquartered in Arkansas, manufactures and delivers high-quality metal building components to post frame, commercial and residential customers.  The employee-owned company currently has manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana and Texas.

Operations at the new metalworking plant will include forming, cutting and assembling coated steel parts and panels.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $40,656, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than Surry Countyâs average annual wage of $28,236.

Gov. Perdue Establishes Offshore Energy Advisory Panel

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the establishment of the Governorâs Scientific Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy.  The panel will thoroughly examine the stateâs offshore energy resources, including oil, gas, wind and other renewable resources, and will make recommendations to ensure that North Carolinaâs offshore resources are used for the benefit of all its citizens.  The Governor created the panel by signing <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=636>Executive Order 23.

âThe North Carolina coast is home to an abundance of natural resources â some of which have the potential to be tapped as energy sources.  As we research this potential for national and state use, I intend to make sure sound science and a thorough examination of the risks and benefits drive our decisions,â said Perdue. âIt is imperative that North Carolina have the opportunity to share in the profits and not limit our options to pursue alternative energy solutions such as wind power.â

The panel will analyze and report on the feasibility of tapping offshore energy sources, and identify the benefits and areas of concern about these energy resources. Members will study current laws, rules, processes and procedures that affect the use of offshore energy resources, such as federal leasing programs, state and federal permitting programs, and local zoning and ordinances. Also, the panel will evaluate federal proposals to use North Carolinaâs offshore energy resources, including any proposals from the U.S. Minerals Management Service for offshore oil and gas lease sales.

Additionally today, the Governor submitted a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, outlining her concerns with the Draft Proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010â2015.  They are:

â¢ The lack of information surrounding which coastal areas are under consideration for energy exploration.
â¢ The federal government has not resolved the issue of revenue sharing for North Carolina and other East Coast states.
â¢ The planning process does not take into consideration potential future uses of renewable sources of energy in the same areas.  The governor is committed to exploring all offshore energy sources including wind and other renewable resources.

Comment: Brilliant! Let's put MORE tax on people who don't have jobs or homes anymore and make the state worse; that is except for Raleigh of course. You need to start within your own office before you almost bankrupt our state again! You need to get out of that cushy office and see the rest of us in the state. I guess the rich people put you in office like a bunch of dummies

> Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of Rural Hope

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday joined the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center, the Golden LEAF Foundation and the N.C. Health and Wellness Trust Fund (HWTF) in announcing the first phase of grant awards for Rural Hope, a rural health care initiative designed to enable better health care delivery and job creation by assisting in the construction and expansion of rural health care facilities.
âIn many areas of our state, rural hospitals and health care facilities work on tight budgets to serve their communities. Rural Hope will ease the burden by bringing health care and jobs to rural communities across North Carolina,â said Perdue. âI commend the North Carolina Rural Center, the Golden Leaf Foundation and the Health and Wellness Trust Fund for working together to support this initiative and making sure our citizens receive the help they need.â
The Rural Hope grant awards are funded by the Rural Center ($3,032,500), the Golden LEAF Foundation ($560,000) and the NC Health and Wellness Trust Fund ($226,366), and range from $32,500 to $480,000, totaling $3,818,866 for the 24 grants awarded.  The grant application required that at least one new job be located in the project building for every $12,000 in grant funds received, resulting in the creation of 310 new jobs.  Application requirements also specified that grants be matched by at least an equal amount of private and/or public funds.
Priority for Rural Hope was given to small towns with a population of less than 5,000 and unincorporated areas, and eligible health care facilities included: hospitals, urgent care centers, physician offices, hospice care, aging centers, mental health providers, physical therapy providers, free clinics, rural and community health centers, dental care, vision care and safety net providers.

North Carolina Breaks into Top 10 Nanotech States

A new study shows that North Carolina has broken into the top 10 states in the nation with the highest concentration of nanotechnology companies, <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map/>universities, research laboratories and organizations, and that Raleigh has moved into the top 5 cities designated as âNano Metroâ clusters.
The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies, which is a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Pew Charitable Trusts. This is the first time North Carolina has been a top-ranked nanotechnology region.
âNanotechnology is fundamental to North Carolinaâs economic development strategy of growing jobs and building a new economy,â Perdue said. âAs one of the top 10 nanotech states, North Carolina will continue to push ahead and lead a technology sector that will change every industry and create products that will change the way we live.â
The data was released by the Project on Emerging Technologies and features more than 1,200 organizations across the United States that are part of the nanotechnology industry.  North Carolina joins California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas as one of the top 10 states.
Raleigh pushed out Oakland to become one of the top 5 Nano Metros.  The full study can be found here: <http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map>www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/putting_nanotechnology_on_map.

EMC Corp. to Make Major Expansion in Wake, Durham with 397 New Jobs

EMC Corp., a world leader in information infrastructure solutions, will expand in the Triangle, adding 397 jobs over the next five years and investing $280 million. The Fortune 200 company plans to establish a new research facility in Durham County and increase its presence in Research Triangle Park and Apex. The project is contingent upon approval of local grants from Durham city and county officials.
âInformation technology companies provide sustainable, well-paying jobs for more than 100,000 workers in North Carolina,â Perdue said. âWhen a world leader in the industry such as EMC Corp. chooses to expand here, it reinforces our message that this is the place for IT companies to do business.â
As a leading developer and provider of information infrastructure technology, solutions and services, EMC provides a foundation for organizations of all sizes to manage and secure their vast and ever-increasing quantities of information; automate their data center operations; reduce power and cooling costs; and leverage critical information for business agility and competitive advantage.  
Headquartered in Massachusetts, EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) employs more than 40,000 people worldwide, including more than 900 employees in North Carolina. The 397 new jobs will pay an overall average salary of $73,325 per year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham annual average of $57,772 and the Wake average of $43,160.
North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate. Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Townsends Adds 103 Jobs in Davie County

Townsends Inc., a leading international producer and marketer of poultry products, will expand in Davie County.  The company plans to create 103 jobs and invest $700,000 over the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $250,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
âFood production and economic growth go hand in hand in North Carolina, a tradition underscored by Townsendsâ expansion in Mocksville,â Gov. Perdue said.  âCompanies like this one continue to find success and expand in our state, attracted by our high-quality workforce and business-friendly environment.â
Townsends, a 118-year-old poultry company headquartered in Delaware, supplies value-added chicken products to the domestic and international food service and retail markets.  The company has a significant presence in North Carolina with three plants located in Pittsboro, Siler City and Mocksville that employ about 1,500 people.  Additionally, the companyâs poultry operations support an extensive grower base in the local area.
The Mocksville facility, operating as Crestwood Farms, a division of Townsends, is the core of the companyâs expansion into value-added chicken products and key to its strategic growth.  The company plans to add a production line of fully cooked products, increasing its capacity by approximately 25 percent.  Currently, Crestwood Farms employs about 267 workers.

State Seeks Return of Yadkin River Flows, Hydroelectric License to the People of North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the State of North Carolina has filed papers with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking return of the right to plan the use of the Yadkin River flows and the Yadkin hydroelectric project for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.
âFifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoaâs request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams because the project created jobs for up to 1,000 North Carolinians,â said Perdue.  âToday, those jobs are gone, and so is the reason for the license.â
âThe State of North Carolina is responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens,â Perdue said. âGiven the Yadkin Riverâs broad impact on the state, we believe strongly that the state is the most appropriate body to plan use of this invaluable natural resource, to help assure the regionâs municipal water supply and quality and to facilitate future growth and development.â
The Yadkin River Basin includes nearly a quarter of the stateâs 100 counties, representing 17.5 percent of its population.
The initial federal license for the Yadkin hydroelectric facilities, which expired in 2008, was granted more than 50 years ago to Alcoa Power Generating Inc. APGI developed a series of dam and hydroelectric plants to serve the industrial needs of its parent company, Alcoa Inc., namely, its aluminum smelting plant in nearby Badin, which required a significant amount of power. The facilities comprising the Yadkin Project have essentially determined how the Yadkin River flows have been used in the state for the past 100 years.

Metal Manufacturer Brings New Plant, 45 Jobs to Surry County

Central States Manufacturing Inc., a regional manufacturer of metal building components, will open a new plant in Mount Airy.  The company plans to invest more than $4.5 million and create 45 jobs.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $135,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
âNorth Carolina retains a strong presence in the manufacturing sector,â Perdue said.  âOur stateâs skilled workforce, strategic location and outstanding quality of life continue to attract growing companies such as Central States Manufacturing.â
Central States Manufacturing Inc., headquartered in Arkansas, manufactures and delivers high-quality metal building components to post frame, commercial and residential customers.  The employee-owned company currently has manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana and Texas.
Operations at the new metalworking plant will include forming, cutting and assembling coated steel parts and panels.  The new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $40,656, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than Surry Countyâs average annual wage of $28,236.

Gov. Perdue Establishes Offshore Energy Advisory Panel

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced the establishment of the Governorâs Scientific Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy.  The panel will thoroughly examine the stateâs offshore energy resources, including oil, gas, wind and other renewable resources, and will make recommendations to ensure that North Carolinaâs offshore resources are used for the benefit of all its citizens.  The Governor created the panel by signing <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=636>Executive Order 23.
âThe North Carolina coast is home to an abundance of natural resources â some of which have the potential to be tapped as energy sources.  As we research this potential for national and state use, I intend to make sure sound science and a thorough examination of the risks and benefits drive our decisions,â said Perdue. âIt is imperative that North Carolina have the opportunity to share in the profits and not limit our options to pursue alternative energy solutions such as wind power.â
The panel will analyze and report on the feasibility of tapping offshore energy sources, and identify the benefits and areas of concern about these energy resources. Members will study current laws, rules, processes and procedures that affect the use of offshore energy resources, such as federal leasing programs, state and federal permitting programs, and local zoning and ordinances. Also, the panel will evaluate federal proposals to use North Carolinaâs offshore energy resources, including any proposals from the U.S. Minerals Management Service for offshore oil and gas lease sales.
Additionally today, the Governor submitted a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, outlining her concerns with the Draft Proposed 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2010â2015.  They are:
â¢ The lack of information surrounding which coastal areas are under consideration for energy exploration.
> â¢ The federal government has not resolved the issue of revenue sharing for North Carolina and other East Coast states.
> â¢ The planning process does not take into consideration potential future uses of renewable sources of energy in the same areas.  The governor is committed to exploring all offshore energy sources including wind and other renewable resources.

Subject: SHAME ON YOU FOR STEALING FROM OUR KID'S EDUCATIONS!

Comment: I have been angry for some time and believe others are as well as we are constantly fed these lines that things, such as the education lottery, will help our kids and their education. Then we find out that you have been "dipping" into the account just because you can, unbelievable! I am a 46 year old mother, breast cancer survivor, and worker, so I'm old and wise enough to know when we are being urinated on but being told it's raining! When will we get leaders who really want to do what's best for this state and are willing to do it no matter what? Just sucking as much money out of our taxpayers and putting programs into place isn't doing the job. We all have an inner compass, please listen to yours. Our children and teachers need help as they have for some time. Yet as soon as there are cuts to be made, what goes first? Our schools. It's time to get out of politics and into helping. If we don't do that, other countries will outpace us in education (has it happened already?) and we will be weak. But who cares? You still have a good paying job, excellent health care and I'm sure you can put your child/children into some expensive private school, right? I don't know why I'm wasting my time other than to vent as I'm sure you won't see this or will dismiss it, but I feel I must express my opinions either way. I am a Christian woman and pray for my leaders (yes, even you) even though I am disgusted with the way things are going.

Subject: Bev's first and last term as governor

Comment: Thanks for taking away our rights, Bev. Now we can no longer put plastic bottles in our landfills. Are you kidding me? While environmental issues are near and dear to my heart, this law makes no sense. What am I supposed to do with the plastic bottles now? I live in rural Randolph county. I pay a private company for trash pickup. There are no recycling facilities around here. The last one in Trinity closed some time back. Am I supposed to drive 30 minutes to the one in Asheboro? I think I'll just pile them up and place them on the side of the road for the state to pick up. I'm sure I can get my neighbors to do the same. Don't you know our road will look great in a week or two. I am so disappointed that I voted for you. Never again. Also, thanks for taking away smoker's rights to light up in restaurants and bars come first of 2010. I'm only 32, yet I remember when the tobacco industry in NC put food on a lot of tables. Wait, it still does. Shall I mention the higher taxes on cigarettes. And the higher sales taxes in general. Have you lost your mind? I'm not sure raising taxes in a weak economy is the best idea. My only hope is that you have enjoyed in the governor's mansion and that your stay there will be temporary. I'm sure someone with the people's best interests in mind will run in 2012. I sure wish 2012 would come sooner.

Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs

> Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity.

> "Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come."

> Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County

> North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> âNorth Carolina, the nationâs most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces,â Perdue said.  âOur stateâs skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses.â

> North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County.

> The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. 

> North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday  announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled.

> âWhen our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn,â said Perdue. âThis partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need.â

> The North Carolina âHealthy & Ready to Learnâ (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

> This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children.

> Gov. Perdue Focuses on Green,  Defense/Aerospace Jobs

Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs
Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity.
"Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come."
Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
âNorth Carolina, the nationâs most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces,â Perdue said.  âOur stateâs skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses.â
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County.
The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. 
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.
For information on North American Aerodynamics, go to <http://naaero.com/>http://naaero.com.  For more information on job opportunities, or to submit a resume, contact Patsy Jones at <http://us.mc637.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=namerican.hr@gmail.com>namerican.hr@gmail.com.
Governor Attends AUSA Conference in Washington, DC
Gov. Perdue on Monday attended the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC.  In an effort to grow our military/aerospace economy, Gov. Perdue spent the day meeting with companies about locating in North Carolina.  She also met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke regarding funding to expand broadband access - the e-NC Authority is to receive $2 million in federal funds.
Pictured here is Governor Perdue with General Dunwoody, the nation's first female four-star general.

Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled.
âWhen our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn,â said Perdue. âThis partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need.â
The North Carolina âHealthy & Ready to Learnâ (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children. The governor also announced that North Carolina received $17 million from a competitive federal grant to expand coverage for uninsured working families, and nearly $3.9 million for Rural Hope, a program that will improve health care facilities in rural North Carolina.

The first meeting of Gov. Perdue's <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630>StreetSafe Task Force was on Thursday.  The task force is charged with finding ways to transition prisoners and probationers back to work instead of back to crime.

Bev Perdue on Monday announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is asking for the publicâs input on the stateâs service needs for its three-year state service plan.  The Commission will feature a survey on its Web site, <http://www.volunteernc.org/>www.volunteernc.org, from Oct. 5-12th.

Governor Says Offenders Will Not Be Turned Loose

Statement from the Governor Regarding Prisoner Release:

When I learned that the Supreme Court had issued a ruling that meant offenders serving life in prison would be released after a mere 35 years, I was appalled. Like most of my fellow North Carolinians, I believe life should mean life, and even if a life sentence is defined as 80 years, getting out after only 35 is simply unacceptable.

Since that ruling, my staff and I have been doing everything we can to stop the release of these rapists and murderers. These are people who have been denied parole repeatedly, and many who have numerous infractions during their prison stay. I do not believe they are ready for release onto the streets of our communities.

While I understand the decision of the Supreme Court, I believe there remain unresolved legal issues that were not addressed. Before Mr. Bowden or any other offender affected by the Courts decision is turned loose, these issues must be heard.

At issue is the application of good behavior credits to these violent offenders serving life sentences since the 1970s. Since last week, we have been scrutinizing the good behavior credits applied to the 20 inmates eligible for immediate release. This morning, legal counsel and Department of Correction staff met with officials who oversaw the application of those behavior credits during the 1980s. At the time, the DOC gave inmates day-for-day credits under the authority of the then-secretary. There is a real question whether the General Assembly intended for the DOC to have that kind of authority. I do not believe they did, and my legal counsel agrees. This raises the very real question that these inmates should not be eligible for early release.

Mr. Bowdens case is in the process of being sent back to the trial court to recalculate his sentence. These issues can be resolved by the courts.

Until these new legal issues have been resolved by the courts, Mr. Bowden and the other violent offenders will not be released.

Southeast Governors Announce Formation of a South Atlantic Alliance

Gov. Perdue announced this week that she has joined three other governors of Southeastern states in an agreement to work together to better manage and protect ocean and coastal resources, ensure regional economic sustainability and respond to disasters such as hurricanes.

The agreement establishes an alliance among North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The South Atlantic Alliance will leverage resources from each state to protect and maintain healthy coastal ecosystems, keep waterfronts working, enhance clean ocean and coastal waters and help make communities more resilient after theyve been struck by natural disasters.

The alliance was signed by North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist.

All four governors realize that we are facing considerable challenges to sustain our coastal resources for future generations, said North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue. This alliance will enable us to work together to protect our ocean environment and the health and economic well-being of the people dependent on those resources.

This Governors South Atlantic Alliance is a state-led partnership leveraging resources from the public and private sectors, business and industry communities, local governments, federal agencies, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address regional priorities.

All of the Governors welcomed the agreement as an example of the ability to discuss and act regionally on common issues paramount to the Souths economic vitality and quality of life.

Dear Governor:
Why don't you raise taxes even more in NC? That's all you spendthrift thieves in office have ever done, like you are doing now, like you and your disgusting pals in the GA did for many, many years.

In spite of the growing unemployment and underemployment in this beleaguered state, why don't you force out more free enterprise businesses?

You and the crooked, thieving public arrogants of both parties do not care one bit for the hardworking people in your state. You have betrayed your people. You are a disgrace. You and your thieving colleagues should be in jail instead of in high office.

Disgusted,

Karen Carter

Happy Thanksgiving!

I wish you and your family many blessings and a very happy Thanksgiving weekend!  Please travel safely and eat well.  I will be with my family this weekend, and giving thanks for my many blessings. But I will also take a moment to remember those I've met recently who are less fortunate. 

On Monday, I helped deliver the four millionth meal for the Winston-Salem Meals-on-Wheels program.  After I delivered her meal, Ms. Nancy Hooper told me how thankful she is for the volunteers.  Itâs more than just a warm meal those dedicated North Carolinians bring â it's a smiling face, a friendly conversation, a little bit of humanity. That can make all the difference. 

On Tuesday, I spent some time at the Raleigh Rescue Mission.  I spoke with many of the people there â some were recovering from addiction and others were unlucky families who are homeless for the holidays.  At the children's development center, I listened to pre-schoolers of homeless mothers.  Despite their situation, they were all able to list something they were thankful for â and there's nothing like the sincerity of a child to brighten your day and give you hope for the future.

Please count your blessings and give thanks this weekend. Remember your friends and neighbors who may be struggling this year; it's a rough time for many North Carolina families, but together, we will get through this. Let's all take inspiration and hope from stories like those from Meals on Wheels and the Rescue Mission â we all have something to be thankful for.

Experts laud North Carolina's finances

Every state has been hit hard by the global economic crisis.  State budgets across the country have seen record shortfalls and deficits.  But not many states have dealt with these financial hardships as well as North Carolina.  Experts have lauded North Carolinaâs budget management.

Last month, the stateâs AAA bond rating was reaffirmed by the three rating agencies.  North Carolina was one of only seven states to get the AAA bond rating from all three agencies.  The other states were Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Missouri and Utah.

In particular, Moodyâs emphasized the stateâs proactive budget management: âMoodyâs believes that the stateâs strong executive management and proactive responses to its unexpected budget shortfalls will enable North Carolina to manage ongoing fiscal pressures.â

Additionally, a recent <http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/>Pew Center on the States study of states in fiscal peril put North Carolina in the top 20 of states in the best financial condition.

Gov. Perdue Announces Haywood County Businesses to Receive Disaster Aid

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday announced the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has agreed to provide low-interest government loans to help eligible Haywood County businesses cover normal operating expenses. Several business owners asked the state for financial assistance after they experienced a dramatic decrease in business activity over the past three weeks.

âThese federal loans are critical to protect western North Carolina businesses and the families that rely on them for their livelihood,â said Perdue.  âI encourage eligible businesses that need extra help to take advantage of this opportunity.â

A major rockslide near the Tennessee border on Oct. 25 has shut down Interstate 40 while crews work to remove the debris and repair the road. Traffic has been rerouted along Interstates 26 and 81.

The SBAâs Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program provides loans to help business owners pay bills when their businesses are not producing income. The EIDL is available even if the business didnât suffer physical damage; loans are available only to applicants determined by SBA to have no credit available elsewhere. All Economic Injury Disaster Loans are made at the four percent interest rate with terms up to 30 years. Small businesses may borrow up to $2 million, but specific amounts and terms are set by the SBA based on each applicantâs financial condition.

Several businesses were significantly impacted by the rock-slide detour.  The SBA declared Haywood County a disaster area as a result of the rock slide.  Under SBA rules, businesses in Buncombe, Henderson, Jackson, Madison, Swain and Transylvania counties that also suffered economic losses as a result of the damaged highway also may be eligible for assistance.

Governor Speeds Up Unemployment Benefits for ConAgra Workers

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday signed Executive Order No. 31 to extend immediate eligibility for unemployment benefits to laid-off ConAgra Foods employees.  State law permits the Governor to waive the âwaiting weekâ for unemployment benefits for the victims of a major industrial disaster.

âAlready in the midst of tough economic times, the ConAgra disaster was a major blow to hundreds of North Carolina families,â said Perdue.  âSpeeding up unemployment benefits will help these families get back on their feet faster.â

On June 9, 2009 an explosion occurred at ConAgraâs Slim Jim plant in Garner.  The explosion has claimed the lives of four workers and injured dozens more.  ConAgra has resumed limited production at the facilityâwell below its capacity.  ConAgra ended compensation for some of its employees last week.

8 Contracts Totaling $21.3 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across North Carolina

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Monday that eight contracts totaling $21.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including four projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by the N.C. Department of Transportation to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

âRecovery dollars continue to help us put North Carolinians to work and deliver much-needed transportation projects,â Perdue said.

The four recovery projects are located in Alleghany, Halifax, Rockingham and Wilson counties.   The six other projects are located in Brunswick, Duplin, New Hanover, Onslow, Pender, Sampson and Wake counties.

Two other projects, one for the Daniel Street Extension in Edgecombe County and one for a bridge replacement in Forsyth County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met âgood faith effortâ requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

The bids received on all 10 projects advertised came in 9.8 percent, or about $4.1 million, below NCDOT estimates.  For more information about funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

Gov. Perdue Requests Federal Disaster Declaration for Dare County

Gov. Perdue on Wednesday requested assistance from the federal government for homeowners and businesses in Dare County affected by the recent nor'easter. In asking for a U.S. Small Business Administration disaster declaration, Gov. Perdue sought funding to help homeowners and businesses in Dare County that sustained major damages from the recent storm.  If approved, the declaration will make low-interest loans available to help eligible property owners make repairs.  Also eligible will be Currituck, Hyde and Tyrrell counties.

âThese federal loans will offer needed assistance to coastal residents to rebuild their homes and businesses,â said Perdue.  âI saw the damage in Dare County first-hand and itâs important that we get everyone back on their feet quickly.â

Between November 10 and 15, a norâeaster related to the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through coastal North Carolina.  The most severe damage was found in Dare County.  A damage assessment survey found several homes and business having sustained major damage as a result of the storm. 

An SBA disaster declaration would enable eligible citizens to apply for low interest home and personal property loans to pay for repairs and loss of inventory or other business capital.  If the request is approved, citizens will be advised of the process for applying for loans.

> Talking Environment, Economy, Jobs in Washington

Thursday's Blog from Gov. Perdue:

> This week I went again to Washington to discuss the economy, jobs and North Carolina on the national  and international  stage.

> I met first with Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and discussed the Energy Departments upcoming competition to create a series of national renewable energy hubs. The hubs  one of which could ideally be located in North Carolina  would bring together scientists, industry, and government resources to move us all forward on the road to cleaner energy and independence from foreign oil. The Research Triangle Energy Consortium here in North Carolina will be the strongest applicant for some $135 million the DOE plans to spend for one of these hubs during the next five years, and I wanted the secretary to know that. The Consortium ties together UNC-Chapel Hill, NC State, Duke and the Research Triangle Institute with other area institutions and industry players in the effort to develop new technologies using sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to both capture carbon emissions and  get this  turn them into liquid fuels through processes mimicking photosynthesis.

> What a vision.  Basically recycling carbon pollution into carbon-neutral fuels that can reduce our dependence on uncertain overseas petroleum sources, while creating good jobs in America at the same time.  Combined with our existing efforts though the NC Biotechnology Center and the NC Biofuels Center, such a national hub would become a jobs driver that will pay dividends here in the Old North State, and to the nation and the world.

> Before heading home I talked with senior White House officials and several other governors about the economy and jobs, and the necessity for continued joint efforts to support the recovery that were beginning to see.  While GDP and corporate activity is rebounding, and the stimulus passed early this year is making a real difference, I will not rest until we have brought down the unemployment that has spiked so high in our State and nationally this year.

> It is reassuring and encouraging to be able to report that we are not on our own; we have leadership in Washington that understands our issues and wants our ideas on how to bring back good jobs for all our people.  Stay tuned.

> Coastal Homeowners and Businesses to Get Disaster Aid

The U.S. Small Business Administration has agreed to provide low-interest government loans to help eligible homeowners and businesses in Dare County cover losses and normal operating expenses from a noreaster that struck Nov. 10-15.

> The remnants of Hurricane Ida caused significant loss and damage to businesses and homeowners on our northern coast, said Perdue, who had requested the SBA loans. These federally-backed loans will provide needed relief and help our people and communities recover from their losses.

> More than 25 homeowners and businesses were significantly impacted by the storm.  The SBA declared Dare County a disaster area as a result of the storm.  Under SBA rules, homeowners and businesses in Currituck, Hyde and Tyrrell counties that also suffered losses may be eligible for assistance.

> Fiber Manufacturer Brings 25 Jobs to Rockingham County

SANS Technical Fibers LLC, an international manufacturer of synthetic nylon filament and yarn for the high-performance, military, automotive and other markets, will expand its plant in Rockingham County.  The company will invest more than $2.8 million and create 25 jobs in Stoneville.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $60,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> North Carolina remains a top choice for successful companies adapting to compete in a global marketplace, Gov. Perdue said.  Our exceptional quality of life and skilled workforce continue to attract companies looking for the perfect location to expand and prosper.

> SANS Technical Fibers, headquartered in Gastonia, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AECI Limited of South Africa.  AECI has consolidated its fiber-producing operations to the Stoneville plant, which currently employs about 100 people.

> For information on company job opportunities, please contact: <mailto:hr@sansfibers.com>hr@sansfibers.com.

Email: eshugart@actmanre.com

Subject: 13

Comment: I have read that Governor Perdue is studying ways to save money within the NC government. One suggestion that could save taxpayers millions of dollars is to cut back on the number of NC government cars. I realize that there is or has been some sort of study on this, but obviously it did not come up with any recommendations. Our office here in Winston-Salem is in the same building as the state of NC OSHA local office. It appears that there are a total of around 12 or 13 employees employed there. There are also 12 or 13 state owned automobiles in our parking lot. I have never seen more than 5 or 6 cars out of the lot at any point in time. That implies to me that they do not need more than 5 or 6 (if any) at a time. I suspect that this is holds true with most of the government offices. If so, NC is purchasing and maintaining thousands of excess automobiles. Getting rid of them would save millions of our hard earned tax dollars each year.

Subject: Haiti children

Comment: I am requesting as one mother to another that maybe the state of north carolina can step up and save some haiti children. The governor of PA took a plane in. Before the earthquake they had 380,000 orphans, we need to help. I am sure airlines would donate their services to bring children home to the u.s. We are extremely frustrated by this disaster and are truly heart broken for the children. We want to open up our home to a child. Please let me know if I can assist you anyway, I have contacts with DSS and they are willing to do what it takes. Lorraine Enste

Is there any reason why our State shouldn't follow the examples of Indiana & Arizona? What are we waiting for, the mid term elections?

Arizona and Indiana Move Forward With Immigration Enforcement Bills
Faced with rising unemployment and the federal governments refusal to enforce our immigration laws, state legislatures are moving to address these issues on their own. Last week, senate committees in Indiana and Arizona voted to move forward with two enforcement-oriented bills.

On January 20, 2010, the Indiana Senate Committee on Pensions and Labor passed Senate Bill (SB) 213 by a unanimous vote of nine to zero. (<http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2010/PDF/Srollcal/6791.PDF.pdf>Roll Call Vote # 6791, January 20, 2010).  Sponsored by State Senators Mike Delph (R-Carmel), Phil Boots (R-Crawfordsville), and Dennis Kruse (R-Auburn), SB 213 would require all state agencies, municipalities, and employers that contract with state and local government entities in Indiana to use E-Verify.  SB 213 would also require the states Department of Labor to verify citizenship before determining eligibility for unemployment benefits and prohibit the enactment of sanctuary ordinances throughout the state.  (<http://www.in.gov/legislative/senate_republicans/homepages/s29/files/SB_213.pdf>Senate Bill No. 213; <http://www.in.gov/legislative/senate_republicans/homepages/s29/5700.htm>Bill Summary; and <http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/49668.htm>Press Release, January 6, 2010). The bill will now move before the Senate Committee on Appropriations for further consideration. (<http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2010/PDF/SCRP/DP021301.001.pdf>Committee Report, January 21, 2010).

Also on January 20, the Arizona Senate Committee on Public Safety and Human Services approved SB 1070 by a vote of four to three. (<http://azleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=13&clip_id=6415>Committee Meeting Video, January 20, 2010).  Entitled the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, SB 1070 would prohibit Arizona police departments from adopting sanctuary policies that prevent officers from asking individuals about their immigration status. SB 1070 would also establish a new state trespassing statute that would make it illegal for any person to be present on any public or private land in Arizona in violation of federal immigration law. The bill, which has drawn support from the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association and the Arizona Police Association, must now pass the State Senates Rules Committee before receiving consideration before the full Senate. (<http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2010/01/21/20100121immigrationbills0121.html>The Arizona Republic, January 21, 2010). A similar bill passed the Arizona State Senate last year, but stalled in the House. (<http://www.kswt.com/Global/story.asp?S=11852293>KSWT, January 20, 2010).

Subject: 10th Amendment to keep NC from going Bankrupt

Comment: Michael Norbury PO Box 38892 Greensboro, NC 27438-8892 January 26, 2010 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: The US Senate is trying to trick the US House into passing the Senate Health Bill with a promise letter from 52 Senators stating they'll pass companion legislation down the road to make the House happy. This means the health care monstrosity is still in play and North Carolina needs the 10th Amendment now to protect itself. Get to work on it or we'll have to get to work on your opponents election campaign.

Subject: Please Protect My Right to Play Poker on the Internet

Comment: Cathy Valand 7817 Harbor Drive RALEIGH, NC 27615-4516 January 26, 2010 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I am writing to ask for your support regarding specific actions our great state will be required to take if legislation in the U.S. Congress becomes law. Specifically, two bills to license, regulate, and tax online games of skill like poker have been introduced in the Congress. If either passes into law, our state will have to make a choice. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE FEDERAL BILLS, THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE. We can either participate in the program or opt out of the provisions of the bill. I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members, can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Cathy Valand 919-676-4882
