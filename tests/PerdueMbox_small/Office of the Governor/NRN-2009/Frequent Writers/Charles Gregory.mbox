Subject: Complaint of TV 9 WNCT to FCC expands to other TV and Radio Stations and Legislators


While Kevin Martin FCC Chair and Native North Carolinian assured immediate attention to the Formal Complaint against TV 9 WNCT for ignoring Water Contamination by the PCS Mine and Misappropriations of North Carolina Clean Water Trust Funds to the River Dunes Development, a comprehensive list of all TV and Radio Stations including University Operated Stations that have received thousands of emails with attached documents of the EPA Violations of the PCS Water Contaminations and the Bay River Sewage/River Dunes Scam and Sewergate Cover up.


In addition to not reporting statewide Water Contamination, and Misappropriations of Clean Water Trust Funds, TV 9 WNCT made no mention of the Petition that is being circulated to all 100 North Carolina Counties to have North Carolina Licenses of Corrupt Accountants, Attorneys, and Engineers suspended and revoked for obstruction of justice in the Bay River Sewer/River Dunes Scam and Cover up of Misappropriations of Clean Water Trust Funds from existing needs for low income people.


The NC State Bar has ignored a complaint against conflicted River Dunes Pamlico, Jones, and Craven County Attorney Jimmie Hicks.


The NC CPA Board has ignored Bay River Sewage Accountant Lu Cannon of McGladry and Pullen.


The Examining Board for Surveys and Engineers has ignored complaints of total fraudulent documents by Bay River Sewage Engineer Kevin Eberle of McKim and Creed.


Federal Investigations are now focused on the Legislators with regulatory control who continue to allow Public Funds to be stolen while North Carolina Citizens are dieing from Toxic Water.

Subject: Formal Complaint of TV 9 WNCT to FCC

After 45 years of ignoring the threat of water quality contamination posed by the PCS Mine constantly pumping 78 million gallons of water per day, and after receiving EPA documents confirming Cadmium Toxic levels of 300 times acceptable safe levels.


WNCT TV 9 totally disregarded the EPA "Public's Right To Know" Laws of Toxic Water Contamination and refused to inform the public. 


Instead WNCT TV 9 reporter Author Mondale deliberately chose to ignore all Maps, Documents, and Reports detailing subsidence, water contamination, and a 500 million dollar law suit against PCS for water contamination presented by five speakers of the Environmental Investigation Coalition in a meeting of the Albemarle- Pamlico Republican Club.


Mondale discounted a standing room only crowd, and why the Environmental Investigative Coalition was invited to present facts and documents on concerns of water contamination directly connected to the PCS Mine and pubic Clean Water Trust Funds that were diverted by the Bay River Sewage/ River Dunes Scam and Sewergate Cover up.


Mondale totally ignored the pleas and questions why every member of the Edenton Woman’s Club are suffering from cancer, and claims of every dog and cat dieing in some neighborhoods in the area.


WNCT TV 9 broadcast on public airwaves with an obligation to protect the public of threats such as the water contamination.


The EPA Public Rights to Know Laws which require public notices each year have never been followed DENR/DWQ and PCS. The reported 300 time the safe level of Cadmium levels are confirmed and documented.


Author Mondale, WNCT TV 9, and Media General are complicit and have completely ignored Deaths, and Health and Safety of the 2 million people dependent on the Castle Hayne Aquifer.


For the above reasons Waterfront Sportsman Editor Dale Swiggett personally delivered to Mr. Kevin Martin Chairman of United States Federal Communications Commission a formal complaint against the Author Mondale, WNCT TV 9, and Media General.


The formal complaint is asking for a complete investigation that could lead to suspension of the Author Mondale, WNCT TV 9, and Media General right to continue to broadcast because of a breach of public trust.



TO: Mr. Kevin Martin, FCC Chairman
DATE: January 13th, 2009
RE: Request for investigation of NC’s General Media

Dear Mr. Martin:

The members of Environmental Investigation Coalition (EIC) duly request that the FCC call for an investigation of WNCT Channel 9 in Greenville, NC and all of NC’s General Media regarding the blatant disregard of properly and accurately reporting on our state’s crisis concerning water quality issues resulting from environmental policies that are inadequate and harmful to over 2 million NC residents.

Enclosed you will find the Press Kit that EIC distributed to the media that chose to cover our group’s presentation given to the members of the Albemarle-Pamlico Republican Party. Members in attendance represented several NC coastal counties who are very concerned about our state’s water issues, which are being compromised by our state’s government officials and agencies.

WNCT did indeed cover our presentation but when the story aired, the station misrepresented our message and disregarded the documentation provided to the attendees. We are thankful for the coverage but very disappointed that the station chose to take the easy way out and gut the facts we presented.

Our mainstream media refuses to accurately report our findings and this is a gross disservice to all NC residents and beyond regarding the Right To Know and Freedom of Information policies that supposedly your agency should be enforcing.

Thankfully, we have the Internet at our disposal to ensure that the people are truthfully informed about the serious crisis of contaminated water that affects not only all of NC residents but four other states to our north since the Castle Hayne Aquifer provides water to over 30 million people (documentation supporting our claim is enclosed). We have documentation stating that Cadmium levels are 300 times more than what is allowed by the EPA in our water on the coast. This is directly attributed to the PCS Phosphate operation located in Aurora , NC .

Members of EIC are available to meet with the FCC to go over in detail what exactly is happening in our great state of North Carolina . The people have a right to know why there are unusually high numbers of cancer-related illnesses and deaths on our coast, as well as other parts of NC. Not to mention that because several NC military bases are located in the contamination area in eastern NC, this health crisis has considerable impact on the US ’s Homeland Security Department.

Mr. Martin, thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to talking with the FCC soon.

Respectfully yours…..

So you gets a sop - - in exchange for your job being handled by holder of a newly created position:

   "Perdue also announced she has asked N.C. Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson --
   who is elected statewide -- to lead a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Career Development and Workforce Issues."

Constitution: minor - - & apparently only a brief inconvenience . . . .

And this, preached by Republicans for umpteen years gets us labelled anti-education! Ah, deliver me!

This Old State

Jack Betts on North Carolina people, politics,
history, environment, culture and books

Monday, January 26, 2009

<http://jackbetts.blogspot.com/2009/01/will-this-fix-dysfunctional-schools.html>Will this fix 'dysfunctional' schools?

 Gov. Bev Perdue has announced plans to change the way the state's public schools are governed,
including the resignation of longtime State Board of Education Chairman Howard Lee and the naming
of Cumberland County Schools Superintendent Bill Harrison to the State Board of Education.

She wants the board to name Harrison chairman of the board as well as to

     create the job of Chief Executive Officer of the state's public schools system.

She also said she has asked Lee to serve as Executive Director of the N.C. Education Cabinet, a newly created job
she hopes will reinvigorate the work of the cabinet, which includes the heads of the N.C. Community College
System, the University of North Carolina system and the N.C. Independent Colleges and Universities.

Perdue also announced she has asked N.C. Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson -- who is elected
statewide -- to lead a Blue Ribbon Task Force on Career Development and Workforce Issues.

Perdue's announcement was made in front of a group that included Lee, Atkinson and Scott Ralls, president of the
community college system, Erskine Bowles, president of the UNC system, and Hope Williams, president of the
Independent Colleges and Universities, as a show of support for the changes.

The timing is interesting. On Tuesday, a new report from the General Assembly's Program Evaluation Division will
recommend changes in public schools governance because the current system is "dysfunctional, confusing
and in need of change."

The state Constitution creates the elected post of Superintendent of Public Instruction, but also gives the job of running
schools to the State Board of Education -- and in practice the board lately has pretty much ignored the superintendent
and gone its own way.

"The current hybrid situation does not work," the legislature's report concludes. This two-headed system -- with policy
and operations accountability spread here and there -- has caused all sorts of problems, but legislators have not found
a way to resolve it.

Perdue's may not resolve it either, although she believes her method will resolve lines of authority and make it clear that,
as she put it, “The buck stops with me.” That's one reason she had a number of education leaders present to lend their
support for the new arrangement. The point was that these education leaders are on record as supporting the new arrangement.

I don’t think this announcement will halt the questions about how our system of governance works, but Perdue is right about this:
The legislature hasn’t acted. I don’t know if the legislature can act, given its difficulty coming to grips with what clearly has been
a problem for the last quarter-century.

Perdue said it would take 18 months or two years for the legislature to amend the Constitution and set up a statewide referendum,
and she wanted to move quickly and fix the problem. “It’s up to the General Assembly and others to deal with the Constitutional
question,” said. She added that for herself, the changes she proposes answer the question about lines of responsibility for schools.

Bev Perdue's showing up not just on celebratory occasions, but in unexpected places, too,
as she puts a firm imprint on state government.

is like yesterday indeed: applause for feckless Dem leaders, so-called - - rather than buttkicks
over more-of-the-same!

What our honest, hard-hitting amiga in CharMeck, Suzanne - - rightly calls media cheerleading,
rather than watchdogging, ugh!

Little wonder Dem pols (esp eddicrats!) see themselves as heroic problem-solvers - - rather than
the major part of the problem . . . .

And, Gary - -

how did your like the cavlier(ette) manner in which Gov Perdue disposed of the
constitution's time-consuming requirement . . . .

<The state constitution calls the superintendent the chief administrative officer of the board,
whose voting members largely are appointed by the governor and are directed to supervise
and administer the public schools.>

Minor inconvenience???

Is Mr Harrison the new JB Buxton?

And what of the children/students . . . .

Perdue takes her crack at streamlining education in NC

 • published January 29, 2009 12:15 am

A number of North Carolina governors have aspired to the crown of being called “The Education Governor.’’ Charles Brantley Aycock was the
original due to his improvements in public education from 1901 to 1905. Terry Sanford earned the moniker a few decades later. Serving from
1961 to 1965, he doubled public school expenditures and consolidated the UNC system. In four terms Jim Hunt became a leader pushing for
education reform and early childhood development. Mike Easley also pushed the latter. [LOL!!!]

Now, Gov. Beverly Perdue is setting her sights on education. Her goal is to streamline the state’s education bureaucracy and give a muddled system
new accountability.
A first move

To that end, she named William “Bill” Harrison to become State Board of Education chair and to a new position, CEO of the state’s public schools.
The move puts the power of both day-by-day school functions and grand strategy in Harrison’s hands.

“I believe the changes will end up providing more accountability in our schools and I believe what you’re seeing is the first movement toward a more
consolidated system,” Perdue told the News-Record of Greensboro.

We feel North Carolina has a good public education system, and parts of it are outstanding. [Really???] However, the education bureaucracy is
by its very design something of a maze that makes it hard to figure out who’s in charge. Course of study and test requirements are set in one place,
the Department of Public Instruction; overall school strategy is set by the North Carolina school board, funding comes from state, local and some
city governments, etc. There are many fingers in the pie.

Perdue’s decision is awkward from this standpoint: In the eye of the public, most of the powers being handed to Harrison would already be in the
hands of the top elected education official in the state, Superintendent June Atkinson.

However, Atkinson doesn’t actually have a great deal of authority, and doesn’t manage the state’s education department.

Accountability eyed

Perdue said Harrison’s ascension means there will be a clear point person atop the 780-person Department of Public Instruction, with the authority and
the accountability necessary to be in charge of the largest chunk of the state’s budget — education — and its most important mission, ensuring a quality
future for North Carolina’s children.

Addressing the state’s four-year cohort graduation rate, which hovers around an embarrassingly low 70 percent, should be job one. Addressing the needs
of the state’s 1.5 million students during an economic turndown will be a close second.

We can’t say how this will pan out, but it’s worth a try. The importance of the job Harrison faces was best summed up by Perdue in a comment to
The Associated Press: “This is the most important job in North Carolina at this point in time. He literally has North Carolina’s future in his hands.’’

We wish him luck.

"North Carolina doesn’t need an elected, paid ambassador to schools. It needs someone in charge who has authority to fix problem."

A need that will NOT be met by Dem pols (esp Jim Hunt toadies!) & educrat bureaucracy!

But thanks for highlighting 'damage done students'. Jes' maybe when the Dem Oligarkhs' butts
are well & truly (deservedly!) kicked by their media colleagues, they'll take note.  8-)

NCGA Rs - - & education leaders/volunteers like Bob Luddy - - keep on trying for reform, the Lord bless them!

Gratuitous suggestion to pols/educrats: outsource say 50 schools in Durham/Wake/Franklin counties - -
to Mr Luddy IF he's willing  ;-)   at plus or minus $5K/kid . . . . www.thalesacademy.org

It makes sense to restructure leadership of North Carolina's public education agencies. While lawmakers are considering changes,
they also could dig a little deeper for cost-saving improvements.

I gratuitously re-confirm  O:-)   that if you have a genuine interest in leading education reform

You have inside experience of what your fellow D electeds think of you & your office. And you have
continuing evidences of Republican electeds' interest & work for positive, constructive reform.

Too bad IMO kids' education is politically-determined. Ideas of the book's authors are a giant leap,

Editorial Reviews [excerpts]
from Publishers Weekly
It's no secret that people learn in different ways, so why, the authors of this book ask, "can't schools customize their teaching?"
The current system, "designed for standardization," must by its nature ignore the individual needs of each student.

The answer to this problem, the authors argue, is "disruptive innovation," a principle introduced (and initially applied to business)
by Harvard Business School professor Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma.

The idea is that an audience in need will benefit from even a faulty opportunity to fulfill that need; in education, the demand for
individual instruction could be met through infinitely customizable online computer-based instruction.

The authors, all professionals in education, present a solution to the ills of standardized education that's visionary but far-fetched;
even they admit that their recommendations would be extremely difficult to implement in current school systems.

Still, the authors' unusual case, though occasionally bogged down in tangents, is worthy reading for school administrators, teachers,
parents and, perhaps most of all, software developers. Charts.

Product Description

Selected as one of the "Best Books on Innovation, 2008" by BusinessWeek magazine. .

Named the "Best Human-Capital Book of 2008" by Strategy + Business magazine
. .

A crash course in the business of learning-from the bestselling author of The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution
. .

"Provocatively titled, Disrupting Class is just what America's K-12 education system needs--a well thought-through proposal
for using technology to better serve students and bring our schools into the 21st Century. Unlike so many education 'reforms,'
this is not small-bore stuff. For that reason alone, it's likely to be resisted by defenders of the status quo, even though it's necessary
and right for our kids.
We owe it to them to make sure this book isn't merely a terrific read; it must become a blueprint for educational transformation.".
--Joel Klein, Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education
. .

According to recent studies in neuroscience, the way we learn doesn't always match up with the way we are taught. If we hope to stay
competitive-academically, economically, and technologically-we need to rethink our understanding of intelligence, reevaluate our
educational system, and reinvigorate our commitment to learning.

In other words, we need "disruptive innovation."
. .
You'll learn how
    * . Customized learning will help many more students succeed in school.
    * Student-centric classrooms will increase the demand for new technology.
    * Computers must be disruptively deployed to every student.
    * Disruptive innovation can circumvent roadblocks that have prevented other attempts at school reform.
    * We can compete in the global classroom-and get ahead in the global market.

Filled with fascinating case studies, scientific findings, and unprecedented insights on how innovation must be managed, Disrupting Class will
open your eyes to new possibilities, unlock hidden potential, and get you to think differently.
. . . .

After a barrage of business books that purport to 'fix' American education, at last a book that speaks thoughtfully and imaginatively about
what genuinely individualized education can be like and how to bring it about.
-Howard Gardner, author of Five Minds for the Future
. .

A decade ago, Clayton Christensen wrote a masterpiece, The Innovator's Dilemma, that transformed the way business looks at innovation.
Now, he and two collaborators, Michael B. Horn and Curtis W. Johnson, have come up with another, focusing his groundbreaking theories of
disruptive innovation on education."
-
. .

Full of strategies that are both bold and doable, this brilliant and seminal book shows how we can utilize technology to customize learning.
I recommend it most enthusiastically.
-Adam Urbanski, president of the Rochester (NY) Teachers Association, and vice president of the American Federation of Teachers
. .

"Finally we have a book from the business community that gets it. Disrupting Class from Clayton Christensen and colleagues points out that
motivation is central to learning and that if schools and learning are to be transformed as they must be, motivation must be at the center of the work.
They also point out how technology should be used to personalize learning and what the future might look like for schools . . .."
-Paul Houston, Executive Director, American Association of School Administrators
. .

In Disrupting Class, Christensen, Horn and Johnson argue that the next round of innovation in school reform will involve learning software. While schools
have resisted integrating technology for instruction, today's students are embracing technology in their everyday lives. This book offers promise to
education reformers.
 - Kathleen McCartney, Dean, Harvard Graduate School of Education

In case you missed this, ma'am!

My unsought thoughts are: you as a professional educator (in another incarnation  ;-) )
haven't measured up either - - & you & the Dem Oligarkh/pols have treated the elected
statewide Dr Atkinson shabbily.

But then she has obstructed education reform, along with the D establishment!

All beyond my pay grade - - cerebration & spleen as well!  O:-) 

Positive, constructive alternatives abound, the simplest an expansion of public charter
schools (which it's my understanding, either deliver or are outa business).

N.C. schools: Bureaucracies and budgets

The New Chief and the numbers

Robert Luebke

Published: Thu, Feb. 05, 2009 12:30AM

Modified Thu, Feb. 05, 2009 02:23AM

RALEIGH -- Gov. Beverly Perdue recently named Bill Harrison, superintendent of the Cumberland County Schools,
to what the new governor calls "the most important job in North Carolina."

In his new position as chief operating officer of the state's public schools, Harrison will manage staff at the Department
of Public Instruction and guide policy for the State Board of Education. The new position is intended to provide clear lines
of responsibility and to improve a policymaking process currently bogged down in uncertainty and bureaucracy.

I applaud Perdue's effort to enhance accountability. The size of the job and the complexity of the challenges facing
public education demand that the new position be filled by a top-notch manager with a proven record of performance.

Does Harrison's resume reflect a record of success and accomplishment?

A news release from Perdue's office mentions that "Dr. Harrison is currently superintendent at Cumberland Schools,
the fourth-largest school system in North Carolina." The N&O's news article credited Harrison with previously raising
test scores in Hoke County, one of the state's poorest, and noted that the Cumberland County's 2006 graduation rate
was slightly better than the state's rate.

How have Cumberland County students benefited from Harrison's leadership and experience? A review of
recent test scores (2002-2008), graduation rates and dropout trends is instructive.

END-OF-GRADE AND END-OF-COURSE TEST SCORES: Cumberland's state end-of-grade (EOG) results
in math and reading mirror the same general trend lines of the statewide data: slight improvements in early years
(2002-2005), then dramatic declines, explained in part by newly designed tests with higher standards.

Cumberland's EOG results for grades three through eight consistently lag behind state test scores. In 2008, 52 percent of
the county's students performed at or above grade level in reading, compared to with the statewide average of 56 percent.
In math, 61 percent of Cumberland students scored at or above grade level, compared with the statewide average of
70 percent.

Recent Cumberland results in state end-of-course subject tests have been mixed. Although the percentage of students scoring
at or above grade level increased in seven of 10 subject areas (mirroring general state trends), local scores on specific state
end-of-course tests have exceeded state averages only three times (out of approximately 70 tests) since 2002. EOC exams
are administered to students in grades nine through 12.

ADEQUATE YEARLY PROGRESS (AYP) -- Since 2004, the percentage of Cumberland County public schools making
AYP has generally trended downward: 75.3 percent (2004); 59.3 percent (2005); 31.8 percent (2006); 28.4 percent (2007)
and 25.9 percent (2008). These trends reflect the general decline in state scores. However, Cumberland percentages are
significantly lower than state AYP percentages for the same years: 85.2 percent (2004); 75.3 percent (2005); 79.3 percent (2006);
80.5 percent (2007) and 69.5 percent (2008).

DROPOUT RATES: Cumberland dropout rates are better than statewide averages. The number of dropouts declined from
656 (2002) to 610 (2007). The school system's 2007 dropout rate (3.56 percent) was less than the state rate (5.27 percent).

FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE: Over the past two years, Cumberland County has experienced a slight improvement
in four-year cohort graduation rates. The rate increased from 67.4 percent (2007) to 71.3 percent (2008). This modest upward
trend mirrors a slight improvement in four-year graduation rates statewide. The Cumberland rate for 2007 was actually slightly
lower than the state average (69.5 percent), while the 2008 rate was slightly higher than the 2008 statewide average (70 percent).

While Harrison can be proud of his contributions to the Cumberland schools, his tenure lacks a record of progress and
accomplishment in critical areas. For much of the last seven years, the system has been average or worse on state testing results,
a little better than average on dropout rates and average or a little below on graduation rates.

For a statewide public education system in need of significant improvement, average results simply aren't good enough.

Thirty-four years of service in public education, while laudable, doesn't necessarily qualify one to assume the state's top
education position. If the new chief operating officer position is the "most important job in North Carolina," Perdue may want
to explain why Harrison is the right person for the job.

Accountability Overboard

By Charles D. Chieppo and James T. Gass

Special interest groups opposed to charter schools and high-stakes testing have hijacked the state’s once-independent board of education and stand poised to water down the MCAS tests and the accountability system they support.


 President Barack Obama and Massachusetts governor <http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3homepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Agov3>Deval Patrick are both brilliant orators who espouse the “politics of hope.” Both know about hope firsthand,
having overcome less-than-privileged backgrounds to achieve great success. Patrick endorsed Obama early in the campaign and is a close advisor. That closeness
got Obama in trouble during the primaries, when he was caught cribbing lines from some of Patrick’s speeches. More recently, Patrick chaired the platform committee
for the Democratic National Convention that nominated Obama.

But we can only hope their similarities don’t extend to education policy. Patrick calls education his “singular pursuit.” Yet after winning election in a 2006 landslide fueled by strong support from the Bay State’s powerful teachers unions—including $3 million in contributions—he has pursued the systematic dismantling of reforms that have made Massachusetts the national leader in public education.

The Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 dramatically increased school funding in return for high academic standards, accountability, and enhanced school choice. In the years following, the Commonwealth’s independent board of education, founded in 1837 with Horace Mann at the helm, implemented a set of reforms that have unquestionably been the nation’s most successful.

In 2005, Massachusetts became the first state ever to finish first in four categories of the <http://nces.ed.gov/NATIONSREPORTCARD/>National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): 4th-grade reading and math and 8th-grade reading and math. The next time the test was administered, Bay State students did it again. Late last year, results from the <http://nces.ed.gov/timss/>Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) demonstrated that Massachusetts students are not only the best in the country, they are globally competitive as well. The Commonwealth’s 8th graders tied for first in the world in science and were sixth in math; 4th graders scored second in science and third in math.

Despite the clear success of more than a decade of education reform in Massachusetts, Governor Patrick’s administration has turned its back on the very forces behind that success: it is wavering on standards, choice is under continual fire, and the board of education has been stripped of the independence that for 170 years was Horace Mann’s legacy and had allowed the board to implement reform with a singular focus on improving student achievement.

In June 2008, Governor Patrick released the recommendations of his “<http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3subtopic&L=3&L0=Home&L1=Key+Priorities&L2=World-Class+Education+-+The+Readiness+Project&sid=Agov3>Readiness Project,” an unwieldy 168-member, 13-subcommittee behemoth charged with developing a long-term “action agenda” for education. The plan calls for full-day kindergarten, universal pre-K, consolidation of school districts, and differentiated pay for teachers—
all worthy goals. But the report maintains Patrick’s steadfast resistance to raising caps on charter schools. (Charter schools have the same effect on some of his supporters in the education establishment as Nancy Pelosi has on Rush Limbaugh.) Although the governor claimed during his campaign that he would open more charter schools once he “fixed” the formula by which they are funded, the Readiness Project is virtually silent on charters and their funding.

<http://www.boston.com/>The Boston Globe, which enthusiastically endorsed the governor in both the Democratic primary and the general election, was not impressed. An editorial titled
<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2008/02/24/adrift_in_the_edu_sphere/>“Adrift in the edu-sphere” noted, “It’s nice to explore the educational cosmos. But taxpayers can’t be expected to pay for such a trip&hellipwhen the likely cost of implementing Patrick’s full-blown plans could exceed $2 billion per year.”

Yet another commission, this one tasked with determining how to pay for Patrick’s action agenda, was appointed in June 2008. By the time its report was released, in the midst of a snowstorm on New Year’s Eve, the bottom had fallen out of the economy. Instead of identifying revenues to support new programs, the report focused mostly
on cost-saving measures designed to preserve the current level of quality, although a majority of the commission’s 23 members did endorse raising the Commonwealth’s sales tax from 5 to 6 percent.

Success Story

All of this is particularly bizarre in light of the dramatic strides the state has made in improving its schools. The <http://www.uschamber.com/default>U.S. Chamber of Commerce published a state-by-state report card on educational effectiveness in 2007 that rated the Commonwealth’s public schools number one in the nation.

The combination of funding, standards, accountability, and choice has brought real, measurable gains in student achievement (see Figure 1).

A look at the condition of public education prior to reform shows just how far Massachusetts has come. During the 1980s, the Commonwealth’s verbal SAT scores were below the national average; math scores were below average as late as 1992. A funding system that was overly reliant on local property tax revenue created vast discrepancies from district to district in student achievement, class size, and the availability of resources like textbooks, libraries, and technology.

Since 1993 the Commonwealth has pumped more than $40 billion in new state money into public education, matched by $40 billion-plus in new local funding. Each district’s foundation budget, the minimum expenditure needed to provide an adequate education, is determined by formula, along with the amount each city and town can afford to contribute.

The Commonwealth fills in the gap between the local contribution and the foundation budget. The result is a funding formula in which the vast majority of state education aid goes to the poorer school districts, making Massachusetts one of the national leaders in this respect as well (see Figure 2).

To ensure high academic standards and school-level accountability, state curriculum frameworks provide a subject-by-subject outline of the material that should form the basis of local curricula. To ensure implementation of the frameworks, students are tested each spring. Since 2003, passing the <http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/>Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests (based on the liberal arts-rich content of the frameworks) has been a high school graduation requirement. High-stakes testing also extends to new teachers, who must pass tests that measure communication and literacy skills as well as subject-area knowledge.

The state’s NAEP scores shot up after the curriculum frameworks were completed and the MCAS test was first administered in 1998. By 2007, the average Massachusetts 4th grader was performing at a higher level in math than the average 6th grader had been in 1996. Achieve, Inc., a national education organization established by governors and business leaders, found in 2001 that Massachusetts was the only state among the 10 it examined that had both strong standards and strong assessments. A 2007 study by the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education confirmed the tests’ validity, finding a strong correlation between MCAS results and college performance.  

Noted educator and developer of the Core Knowledge curriculum E. D. Hirsch lauded the Massachusetts approach in a <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/15/AR2008021503008.html>February 2008 op-ed in the Washington Post. “Consider the eighth grade NAEP results from Massachusetts, which are a stunning exception to the nationwide pattern of stagnation and decline,” he wrote. “That is because Massachusetts decided&hellipstudents (and teachers) should learn explicit, substantive things about history, science and literature, and that students should be tested on such knowledge.”

Choice and Charters

In Massachusetts, public charter schools are the principal vehicle for offering educational choice, and the <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.edexcellence.net/>Thomas B. Fordham Foundation has described the Commonwealth’s charter-school approval process as the nation’s most rigorous. Today, roughly 25,000 students (about 2.6 percent of the total public school population) attend Massachusetts charter schools, and another 21,000 are on wait-lists. Admission to an oversubscribed school is by lottery. When a student chooses to transfer to a charter school, funding follows from the district to the charter school. Despite the fact that districts are reimbursed for three years after a student leaves (100 percent the first year, 60 percent the second, and 40 percent in the third) and despite the 2004 adoption of district-friendly changes to the charter-funding formula, the flow of money has made charter schools controversial.

That controversy has fueled a one-step-forward, two-steps-back treatment of charters over the years. Caps on the number of schools have been raised just twice and now stand at 72 for the original type (known as Commonwealth charter schools) and at 48 for Horace Mann charters (a unionized, in-district model sanctioned after Commonwealth charters were established). Other limitations have been placed on both types of charter schools. The statewide share of public school students who can attend charters is capped at 4 percent. In any year in which a new charter school is approved, at least three of the newly approved charters must be located in low-performing districts. The law limits to 9 percent the portion of district spending that can be transferred to charter schools. More than 150 communities, mostly in poorer areas with low-performing schools, are bumping up against that cap, which places a de facto moratorium on charters.

Charter school results have been strong. A 2006 Massachusetts Department of Education study found that 90 percent of charter schools performed as well as or better than the districts from which their students came and 30 percent outperformed sending districts by a substantial margin. Their success has been particularly striking in urban areas, where most charters are located. Several urban charter schools, like Community Day in Lawrence, and MATCH, Boston Prep, and Excel Academy in Boston, serve overwhelmingly low-income and minority populations, yet outscore even the best suburban schools on MCAS tests.

SABIS International Charter School in Springfield is among the schools that have had remarkable success in narrowing achievement gaps based on race and economic status, a clear priority for the next phase of education reform. By 10th grade, Hispanic and African American students, who together make up 60 percent of the school’s student body, outperform white students statewide on the MCAS English exam and are virtually even with statewide averages for white students in math.

More than 2,500 students sit on the school’s waiting list. Every member of all seven graduating classes has been accepted to college.

A study conducted by a team of Harvard and MIT researchers and <http://www.tbf.org/utilitynavigation/multimedialibrary/newsdetail.aspx?id=9490>published in January by the <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.tbf.org/>Boston Foundation showed that Boston charter schools dramatically outperform both district and pilot schools (semi-autonomous district schools created in response to charters). It found that the academic impact from a year spent in a Boston charter is comparable to that of a year spent in one of the city’s elite exam schools and, in middle school math, equivalent to one-half of the achievement gap between black and white students (see Figure 3).

One might expect the governor would support schools that the state’s own analysis and others have found to be successful. Indeed, prior to release of the Readiness Project recommendations, Governor Patrick said, “Everything is on the table because our future is at stake.” Everything, it seems, except expanding the kind of educational choice that transformed the governor’s own life.

Patrick earned a scholarship from <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.abetterchance.org/>A Better Chance, an organization that provides educational opportunities to young people of color. The scholarship transported him from the South Side of Chicago to Milton Academy, an elite Massachusetts preparatory school, and put him on a trajectory that led to Harvard, a top position in the U.S. Department of Justice, the corporate world, and ultimately the governor’s office.

But the Readiness Project includes precious little that would give others the opportunity to choose their school. The Readiness Project proposes “readiness schools,” which would have some of the autonomy of charter schools and some of the features of pilot schools. Teachers in a district school could come together and vote to convert to a readiness school, or districts could initiate the conversion.

As an inducement to adopt the newly proposed schools, S. Paul Reville, whom Patrick appointed first to chair the state board of education and then as secretary of education, floated the possibility of a freeze on charter schools in districts that embrace readiness schools. When the trial balloon became public, he quickly backpedaled in the face of a torrent of opposition.

The administration’s current position on the charter freeze is unclear. When questioned, Patrick said the charter school debate had reached “stalemate” and his plan includes new ways to achieve the same goals.

Dismantling Success

In 2000, the Commonwealth created the <http://www.eqa.mass.edu/home/index.asp>Office of Educational Quality and Accountability (EQA) as an independent state agency to measure the effectiveness of school-district managers at implementing reform. Beginning in 2002, EQA conducted comprehensive audits of more than 175 school districts. The audits scrutinized MCAS performance, district leadership, curriculum and instruction, teacher and student assessment and evaluation, and business and financial operations. All findings were made public.

Soon after taking office, Patrick moved to eliminate the EQA. Opponents particularly disliked the agency because it did its job so well—auditing school districts and reporting when they came up short. Two studies by Boston-based think tank <http://www.pioneerinstitute.org/>Pioneer Institute analyzed agency data and found that low-performing urban districts in particular were not aligning curricula with state frameworks and not using MCAS data effectively to improve achievement by tailoring lessons to student weaknesses.

More than a year after the EQA was scuttled, the co-chairs of the state legislature’s Joint Committee on Education filed a bill, later enacted, creating a new Advisory Council on District Accountability and Assistance. The new agency amounts to the fox guarding the accountability henhouse, replacing the EQA’s independent 5-person board with a 13-member panel that includes representatives of the very people it’s supposed to audit: the <http://www.massupt.org/>Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents; <http://www.aftma.net/>American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts; <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.massteacher.org/>Massachusetts Teachers Association; <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.masc.org/>Massachusetts Association of School Committees; <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.mssaa.org/>Massachusetts Secondary School Administrators Association; and the <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.mespa.org>Massachusetts Elementary School Principals Association.

The administration’s proposal to overhaul the Commonwealth’s education governance structure gained legislative approval in February 2008. An education commissioner who reported to the board of education, not the governor, had long directed primary and secondary public education in Massachusetts. The Patrick proposal resurrected the state secretary of education post, which had been created and abolished twice since the 1970s.

 Reville, who then chaired the board of education, claimed Governor Patrick’s plan kept appropriate distance between politics and education policy. But when a far weaker education secretariat had been proposed in 2003, Reville testified before the legislature in opposition to the plan, saying, “No matter how well constituted, an education secretariat creates a competing center of power that vies with and against the state’s chief school officer, the Commissioner of Education and the state education agency.”

Governor Patrick himself contradicted Reville’s claim that the new proposal was more respectful of independent education policymaking. At its unveiling, the governor said his plan “will be different in that (the secretary) will have real authority.”

But the administration’s main target was the state board of education. In a move reminiscent of FDR’s court-packing plan, the overhaul added two seats to the board, opened up two more slots by removing the commissioner of early childhood education and the chancellor of higher education, made the new secretary a voting member,
and truncated the terms of members least likely to agree with the administration.

Even more importantly, it stripped the renamed Board of Elementary and Secondary Education of its independence, placing it firmly under the governor’s control by giving the new secretary final say over budget requests and veto power over its selection of future commissioners of education. The board had just selected Mitchell Chester, an Ohio education official, to be the next commissioner. Chester beat out Karla Baehr, who was superintendent of schools in the city of Lowell, had gained some prominence among urban superintendents (see sidebar), and was widely seen as the choice of the education establishment and the governor. Baehr was later hired as a deputy commissioner.


 If It Ain’t Broke, Break It

On February 2, 2007, a group of urban school superintendents attended a State House meeting sponsored by a local education group. It was the kind of event at which everybody smiles and talks about the lofty goals they all share, rather than the multitude of issues they’re fighting about behind the scenes.

Immediately following the meeting, the urban superintendents met with Dana Mohler-Faria, education advisor to the newly elected governor Deval Patrick. They brought with them a memorandum that contained policy proposals that stood in stark contrast to the harmonious rhetoric heard just minutes before:

• Restructure the state board of education

• Eliminate the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability and district accountability

• Conduct an independent charter-school study (even though the state department of education had completed a comprehensive study of charter schools just months before)

• Reduce the transfer of district funds to charter schools and remove charters from the state education aid formula, thereby subjecting them to the annual appropriation process.

The memorandum would foretell much of the Patrick administration’s education policy over the next 18 months.

The usually affable Patrick also used the unveiling of his governance proposal to send a message to those concerned about charter schools, saying they should “grow up.” Later, after release of the Boston Foundation study, Patrick called the debate about raising charter caps “a red herring because we’re not at the cap,” despite the fact that Boston is among the urban communities bumping up against the 9 percent of school district spending limitation, with only 111 charter seats remaining and about 7,000 students languishing on wait lists.

In February 2008, the board, still chaired by Reville (he assumed the new secretary of education post on July 1), became the first to reject a charter school recommended for approval by the commissioner of education. The focus of the board’s discussion about the proposed SABIS regional charter school in the city of Brockton was a 2005 state department of education (DOE) report that identified problems at the Springfield SABIS charter school. Days after the new school’s application was rejected, a 2006 DOE letter surfaced that said the Springfield school had successfully addressed all the major issues raised in the earlier report. Company officials who attended the board meeting were not allowed to respond to Reville’s criticisms.

A <http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2008/03/10/the_achievement_gap_wins_one/>Boston Globe<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2008/03/10/the_achievement_gap_wins_one/> editorial noted that the “rejection raises thorny questions about just how hard the Patrick administration is willing to push to achieve equity in education.” Like SABIS’s successful Springfield charter school, the proposed school would have served troubled communities. The most current data available prior to the proposed school’s rejection showed that 20 of Brockton’s 23 schools failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) under federal law, and all 6 failed to make AYP in nearby Randolph, where the schools are in such bad shape the district was required to submit a plan to stave off state receivership. During the board’s debate over the proposed charter school, Patrick appointee and board PTA representative Ruth Kaplan commented that charter schools are too focused on sending students to college, saying “families . . . don’t always know what’s best for their children.”

During the spring of 2008, Reville charged a “21st Century Skills Task Force” with rewriting curricula and ensuring that Massachusetts students are prepared to succeed
in a fast-changing economy. The task force’s report, published in November, proposes revamping MCAS and using the U.S. History test to try out project-based assessments that require students to demonstrate skills like “global awareness,” a change likely to crowd out topics like the Constitution or causes of the Civil War.
It calls on the teachers unions, school committees, and superintendents that have fought education reform for 15 years to determine how to integrate 21st-century skills
in our schools.

In a sad irony, the task force report claims that “Massachusetts can learn from the experience of West Virginia” on ways to incorporate the needed skills. West Virginia students score below the national average on the NAEP tests, and the state was among the seven that saw the largest declines in reading scores between 1998 and 2005.

A month after release of the task force report, former state senate president Thomas Birmingham, one of the architects of education reform, delivered an address in which said he was “discomforted” by the direction of the Readiness Project and that the 21st Century Skills Task Force “may threaten to&hellipdrive us back in the direction of vague expectations and fuzzy standards.”

Teacher testing has also come under fire. In April 2008, the state senate voted to allow some teachers to be licensed even if they failed the required exam three times. The administration announced that it was looking at alternative criteria for aspiring teachers, even though most of the tests are at a high-school level of difficulty. Reville told the Globe the test “isn’t necessarily the best venue for everyone to demonstrate their competency.”

The move to back away from teacher testing sparked another firestorm of opposition. In <http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/10/06/high_standards_for_teachers/>a Boston Globe op-ed, Charles Glenn, then dean ad interim of Boston University’s School of Education, wrote, “It would be a gross disservice for our public school children to be taught by teachers who do not meet the standards set by our current teacher tests.” Reville later said the administration didn’t support the senate vote after all.

With the pillars of reform under attack, Joe Williams, executive director of <http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/www.dfer.org/>Democrats for Education Reform, wrote in the Globe, “You have to wonder why Massachusetts seems intent on retreating from its own nationally recognized success. The backward slide is already evident.”

The Wrong Path

The Commonwealth’s 15-year track record of successful education reform gave Governor Patrick a clear path ahead on education policy. Instead of undoing the reforms of his predecessors, the governor could have built on the state’s success by carrying on the commitment to high standards, fine-tuning a successful accountability system, and maintaining the governance structure that had successfully insulated critical education policy decisions from special-interest pressure. He could extend to others the educational opportunity that transformed his own life by raising from 9 to 20 percent the cap on the amount of money that can be transferred from school districts to charter schools in districts whose MCAS scores are in the bottom 10 percent statewide.  

So far, he has chosen instead to dismantle reform and replace the singular focus on student achievement that was the key to education reform’s success with a wish list that would likely cost taxpayers an additional $2 billion per year. With the new Board of Elementary and Secondary Education stripped of independence, there is no entity left that can operate outside the political arena with the sole mission of improving academic performance.

Results released in September 2008 showed a sharp drop in MCAS pass rates and flat or declining scores in the elementary and middle school grades and in many urban districts. While 15 years of progress will not be undone overnight, as the Patrick administration’s efforts to dismantle reform continue, such drops are likely to become the rule. It is the price we will pay for Massachusetts policymakers snatching defeat from the jaws of the Commonwealth’s historic education-reform victory.

As for President Obama, during the primaries he played to the teachers unions that are a critical Democratic Party constituency by assailing the evils of forcing teachers to “teach to the test.” But once the nomination was secured, he moved to the center, unveiling proposals that included merit pay for teachers and doubling federal charter-school funding. His selection of Arne Duncan, Chicago’s charter-friendly school superintendent, as education secretary also bodes well. Let’s hope that as president he continues down that path rather than the one Governor Patrick has chosen, and that he applies the lessons from the successful reforms in Massachusetts to federal education policy.

CORRECTION: The printed version of this article contains two errors, which have been corrected here. The number of students on waiting lists for charter schools in Boston is about 7,000. The Readiness Finance Commission reportedly favored raising the state sales tax rather than the income tax from 5 to 6 percent.

K-12 Education

Roger Bacon Academy Leads the Way With Basics

Two southeastern N.C. charter schools showing positive results

By Hal Young

February 26, 2009

RALEIGH — A rural school named for a 13th century cleric is one of the largest charter schools in North Carolina.

Despite low funding and an economically disadvantaged demographic, the school’s test scores run above state and local averages,
drawing interest from education leaders in other states. The founder, though, says the school’s success is simply a matter of
observing what works and scrupulously pursuing it.

Charter Day School in Leland teaches grades K-8; a sister campus, Columbus Day School in Whiteville, offers K-4. The two enroll
more than 1,000 students under the aegis of Roger Bacon Academy, which was founded by Mitchell Baker in 2000.

Baker is a retired engineer who began teaching when he sold the company he founded. Astonished to find his children had written off
science in the fourth grade as insufferably dull, he began watching what made the difference between effective and ineffective teaching.
What he learned, he said, was that successful teachers and schools systematically observed the effects of their teaching and
adapted their methods to how their students really learned.

“Others were adopting fads willy-nilly, whatever the latest idea was, and they were invariably not successful. It occurred to me that
education is no different than medicine or engineering — we need to pay attention to data,” Mitchell said.

The school was named in honor of the Franciscan monk who pioneered the modern scientific method, for that reason. “He wasn’t
a big hero, he was not particularly brilliant, but he was excruciatingly honest in the quest for trustworthy knowledge. We always want
to keep that in front of us,” Mitchell said.

Roger Bacon Academy uses the Direct Instruction method, a systematic presentation of “rules, tools, and techniques” rather
than the facilitated discovery model popular in the state’s teacher colleges.

“You can take any content, the classical trivium or something nouveau, as long as it’s nested in a behaviorally sound approach to
instructional design,” Mitchell said. “Look at the end goal task, break it up into components, teach each subskill to mastery.”
Military and industrial training follows this design, “but here, no, no, we take a kindergartner, immerse him in books and expect him
to learn how to read.”

Mitchell said his schools typically hire teachers straight out of college, “before they form bad habits,” and put them through extensive
training before they start teaching. At one time, RBA’s faculty averaged less than three years experience in the classroom.

Megan Britt, a kindergarten teacher at Charter Day School, was hired a month after she graduated from UNC-Wilmington. She said
the intensive phonics program at CDS is more effective than what she learned in college and student teaching, which emphasized “
whole language” theory.

“They learned a lot of sight words, but there was no methodology like we have here,” she said. “This is much more organized that
what I saw student teaching.” Britt said the highly structured program is “very teacher friendly.”

“A lot of people have a problem with the high expectations for the teachers,” she said. “You have to do what you’re supposed to,
and if you don’t, you get called on it — which is good.”

Robert Wingett, a retired Marine who teaches second grade, said the scripted program actually demands creative teaching rather
than squelching it.

“There is a misconception about Direct Instruction, that it is robotic,” he said. “I can assure you it is not.” There are specific skills
that are taught in a particular sequence, he said, but “you can add to the script all you want. You can develop your own style.
The bottom line is to make the kids successful.”

Nila Wojton, who teaches fifth grade, is a 32-year veteran who came to RBA from a Catholic school in Connecticut. She said
the accommodation for special-needs students is “no different than what I was used to” in other school systems. The technique,
while demanding of the teacher, is “effective – absolutely,” she said.

“You are responsible for bringing them to mastery,” she said.

RBA’s philosophy is that every child can learn if properly taught. State records say it’s working. Compared to other Brunswick
County elementary and middle schools, Charter Day School had 17 percent more students on or above grade level for reading,
29 percent more in math, and 23 percent more succeeding in both subjects. Many RBA students are going into Early College
programs next. This occurred while receiving 30 percent less in funding than surrounding schools, Mitchell said.

Leaders in Louisiana contacted RBA about operating similar schools in Baton Rouge, where five failing elementary schools have
been taken over by the state. Proposals are in the works; Baker Mitchell sees it as a logical expansion on the schools’ success
in North Carolina.

“‘No Child Left Behind’ is exactly right,” he said. “We should have every child learning.”

Warm thanks, Beaver - -

for your useful, valuable story about continued obstructionism of education reform - - by
NC Dempols/eddicrats! Sen Larry Shaw (D-Cumberland) excepted. Unless he changed.

Dunno what those more-of-the-same yo-yos got against children, parents, community, our state . . . .

(Now a new layer of bureaucracy is forming: the Perdue-Harrison gig, ugh!)

<Despite Obama's call to increase funding and "help create new, high-quality charter schools,"
N.C. lawmakers remain cautious.> [Er, instead of cautious, I'd say, like, stuck in the mud.]
<But Rep. John Blust , a Greensboro Republican, isn't optimistic that Obama's call will sway Democratic leaders.
"I don't think it will shove those in charge of this legislature one bit. I wish that it would," Blust said. "If there are
options that there can be excellent schools built to take away some of our capital needs and have a great school ...
we ought to take it."> [Way to go, Rep Blust! And every Republican member of NC Legislature. Cheers!]

Rep Lucas:
<House Education Committee Chairman Rep. Marvin Lucas , a Cumberland County Democrat, said he was drafting a bill
that would raise the cap on charters slightly - perhaps to 105 or 110 - but acknowledged that its prospects were uncertain.>
[A gratuitous sop: more words! And from a retired educator.]

Rep Jeffus:
<"I don't, at this point in time, [does she mean, like now?] support raising the cap on the number of charter schools,"
said Rep. Maggie Jeffus , a Guilford County Democrat and former teacher who is involved in education policy in the
General Assembly.>

Rep Harrison [Guilford Democrat]
<opposed charters early in her legislative career but said her views are evolving.> [How long, how long . . . .]

Leanne Winner
<a lobbyist for the N.C. School Boards Association, says charter schools sap resources from the state that
could be used to help public school systems. She also argued that the payment per pupil that charter schools get
was too high in many cases.> [Last I looked, big pix:public charter schools operated at c. 80% of cost
of traditionals.]

As your story quotes: "A charter school is actually working tax dollars as hard as we can work them,"
said Kim Norcross, managing director and acting principal of the Phoenix Academy charter school in High Point.
"We're really saving taxpayer money." You may know, Mark, that Phoenix Academy has been recognized
as an Honor School of Excellence, one of only 84 - - out of the total 2300+ public schools in NC.]

Well, cut the feckless Democrat lot a bit of slack: voters keep electing them. >:o

Gov. Bev Perdue hit an $88 million lottery jackpot last week, and all it cost was the state's integrity.
The governor had a compelling reason to move that much money from lottery accounts to the state's general fund.
Nevertheless, her action contradicts the 2005 lottery law and breaks faith with the public.

Now you talking, Doc June!

But had you done honest effective reform earlier, you'd have citizens with you is my unsought thought.

Pls don't stop at gently rocking the boat, but overturn it - - with all obstructionists aboard!

Warm good wishes for constructive efforts for the children - - the real children, ie., the ones who're in
classrooms of the failed educracy - - which the Oligarkhs & Leg stuck-in-the-muds scramble to continue.

And not the political concept children - - monstrous tool of NC Dempols-educrats used to expand
Bigguvamint, while getting theirs, at expense of the children & taxpayers . . . .

Pls recall my earlier note to you that my kids & all the neighborhood kids got an excellent education
in Raleigh public schools, my grandkids experiencing quality also (public charter students). And I'm
still not magnanimous  ;-)   jes' interested that kids not making it do make it. They deserve it.

Harrison in top schools job, Atkinson may sue

 By EMERY P. DALESIO Associated Press Writer

RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina's elected state schools superintendent said Thursday her constitutional role and that of voters have been usurped by
Gov. Beverly Perdue's moves to consolidate power in public education.

June Atkinson said she is thinking about suing to resolve her role. She said she hoped the Legislature would allow voters to amend the constitution to
specify the duties of her office.

"I definitely believe that this issue needs to be resolved. It could be resolved two ways, either by the General Assembly or a judge," Atkinson said in
an interview. "I just think it is a charade to the voters to have the laws that we have in place now as it relates to the governance of public education."

Earlier Thursday, Atkinson watched as former Cumberland County Schools Superintendent Bill Harrison was sworn into a seat on the state Board of
Education and elected its chairman minutes later. Harrison also was hired this week to the position of schools CEO that Perdue created the job to
consolidate power in public education in a way that makes her ultimately responsible.

But Perdue's moves make Atkinson's job all but extraneous.

The state constitution calls the superintendent the chief administrative officer of the board, whose voting members largely are appointed by the governor
and are directed to supervise and administer the public schools. But legislation approved in 1995 gave the board flexibility to craft the superintendent's job.

Perdue said a month ago that Atkinson would continue to serve as an "ambassador" for the public schools. Some lawmakers, such as Senate leader
Marc Basnight, and education advocates have recommended the state superintendent become an appointed position or be abolished.

Perdue spokeswoman Chrissy Pearson said, "If the General Assembly wants to address the role of the superintendent of public instruction, they're
welcome to do so."

Atkinson said she has no gripe with Harrison or Perdue. "I just think it is time to have a transparent, accountable governance system
that follows the constitution of our state," she said.

Warm thanks for Loretta Boniti's story about charters!

Too bad politics enter education of NC children: Democrat pols & education bureaucrats obstruct reform
initiatives advanced by Republican pols & citizens who want positive results for all students . . . .

Your presenting facts about constructive efforts going forward by citizens may help get reform of our state's
failed public education system: witness a new bureaucracy as solution to problem of the classroom, ugh!

The sympathy one might have for DPI Superintendent Democrat Dr June Atkinson - - urinated upon by
her Democrat colleagues - - is dampened by her own failure to reform, & her continued negativism towards
an effective choice in education.

Reps (from Meck) Jim Gulley & Ric Killian (for whom thanks!) quoted in Ms Boniti's story are just two
Republican electeds who're for dealing effectively to make education work for all students: every Republican
member of NCGA is for eliminating or raising the cap on public charter schools.

Only one Democrat (Sen Larry Shaw - Cumberland) is for it. Sad commentary on those who mouth glowing
words "for our children" - - but fail to act for them!

Native charter school enjoys more room to learn

MATT NEVALA

March 05, 2009 at 3:13PM AKST

The sign above the main entrance features two drawn sets of three brightly-colored salmon bookending the words
Alaska Native Cultural Charter School. It’s a pleasing sight for the staff and students inside, proof positive the
first-year program moved into its permanent East Anchorage digs Feb. 23.

But not everyone seemed wise to the building’s transformation from former furniture store to academic institution
filled with Native flavor. Seeing the out-of-business store’s sign still hanging high above the busy street out front,
a would-be customer mistakenly wandered through the school’s front door in hopes of buying home furnishings.

“I was thinking of putting price tags on some of this stuff,” quipped charter school principal Tim Godfrey as he pointed
to some nearby chairs.

After years of planning and six months spent in a temporary location, the Alaska Native charter school has its foundation.
Spirits are high for students and staff alike — they’re finally home.

“Everyone was very excited, although the staff was shaking in its shoes because of the transition,” Godfrey said. “I had
been promising the kids (the move) for a long time.”

The remodeled building at 110 Muldoon Road is a large, two-story structure filled with wide-open spaces. A majority of
the classrooms, eight in total, reside on the second level. Godfrey’s office, the kindergarten classroom and the kitchen
can be found on the main level. The walls, carpeting and fixtures are colored in various shades of tan and brown,
although many of the walls are covered with some of the student-made drawings and paintings one might expect to see
in an elementary school.

The school opened under the Anchorage School District umbrella in August to provide all public-school students in grades
kindergarten through sixth with an Alaska Native-influenced academic environment. Enrollment started a little lower than
officials hoped, but met the appropriate levels to receive state funding. Godfrey said enrollment fluctuates, but usually hangs
around 150 students on a daily basis.

“The word about us has gotten out there,” Godfrey said. “We’re still getting calls from families wanting to enroll students.”

A quick tour of the facility found the usual hustle and bustle of learning, classrooms full of students working on assignment
under the watchful eyes of teachers. For some, the six months it took to move into the permanent building felt like six years.

“(The temporary location) had such tight quarters, we could not spread out and do some of the activities we wanted,”
said Kristie May Parsons, the school’s special education teacher. “So we’re very happy to be here.

“The students, the parents and the staff all kept on their smiley faces because we knew it was temporary. We were all
keeping a positive outlook as we counted down to get here.”

Godfrey made it clear at the start of the school year, the charter school wouldn’t attempt to compete against rural schools
for students interested in a Native-influenced education. The school wasn’t going to recruit students out of established
schools. But the harsh reality of life in Bush Alaska, the high costs of everything from energy to food, are forcing some
families to move to Anchorage’s urban sprawl.

Alaska Native Cultural Charter School is an option for those families. In a way, the school may assist in closing any
existing rural vs. urban divide.

“We’re focused on preserving the cultural heritage of Alaska Natives,” Godfrey said. “But we don’t want to undermine
that we’re in an urban environment. I’d love these kids to get the education they need to take back to the villages, but
some may choose to stay here and I want them to be productive in these communities.”

Students receive daily doses of Native culture from several sources. Teachers, many of them Native, bring in foods
like smoked salmon. A class recently enjoyed every aspect of tradition in preparing ducks as food, plucking, cleaning
and cooking the birds themselves.

“It was something for them to hold on to,” Godfrey said.

Elders from the Anchorage area make regular appearances in classes to tell stories. Visiting relatives from rural villages
are encouraged to come into the classroom and let the students know what they know.

“The kids and their family members come in and say, ‘this is my Auntie and she is from this village,” Parsons said.
“We openly welcome people from rural Alaska to be part of our environment. The kids love seeing them and hearing
their stories.”

Anchorage School District officials have been in to give the new building their approval. Sen. Lisa Murkowski dropped
by for a tour and delivered a flag flown over the Capital building in Washington, D.C.

“Anyone who is interested, come on in,” Godfrey said. “This is your school.”

As the students and staff get more and more comfortable in their permanent surroundings, more and more activities are planned.

A Junior Native Youth Olympics team recently competed in an event against students from around the state. Godfrey said
a number of after-school programs are in the works.

“We’re going to have a beading club, a drum club and I think we’re going to start a trading card club after spring break,”
he said. “It’s so I don’t have to confiscate Pokemon cards from the kids all the time.

“We’re going to have family movie nights. We definitely have room for everybody.”

It’s the room everyone at the school is most thrilled with.

“Being able to spread out,” Godfrey said. “I just walked into our second-grade classroom. My son is in it as well. It’s one
of our most-challenging groups, and we basically had them shoved into a closet at (the temporary location).

“Second-graders can be kind of crazy at times, but when I walked in it was quiet.”

Ah, beautiful, sir - - inspired & inspiring!

Refreshing your personal references, Phil - - & stirring what IMO is your strong, charitable & positive state
business message:

     Republican legislators pledge to work with Governor Perdue and the Democratic leadership to fashion solutions. 
    However we will support proposals only if they are in keeping with the principles I  outlined earlier; protecting
    the family budget, a focus on core state functions, and appreciating that there is one North Carolina where we
    all live and work and, as we know, where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great.

Wisdom, grace & strength to you as you offer constructive leadership for our state!

Couldn't Have Said It Better. . .
By <http://www.carolinajournal.com/cjcolumnists/display_author.html?id=1>John Hood

March 10, 2009


RALEIGH – Gov. Beverly Perdue gave her first <http://www.charlotteobserver.com/597/story/587025.html>State of the State Address to the North Carolina General Assembly Monday night.

Those who were looking for specifics on her forthcoming budget or rhetoric destined for the annals of political wordsmithery were surely disappointed.

I was expecting neither. So I found myself enjoying some of her alliterations and turns-of-phrase, and appreciating her call for fiscal conservatism during difficult economic times in North Carolina.

My favorite moment of her appearance was early and unscripted. During the lengthy series of formal introductions and ovations, Perdue tried to move things along by waving the lawmakers and dignitaries down in their seats.


“All right, y’all, that’s enough,” she said impatiently. “Let’s get down to business.”

Someone should say that about 20 more times to the state legislature. Maybe it will sink in.

Another good moment came later in the prepared address when Perdue got into an extended riff about the need for fiscal restraint.

 “Starting today,” she said, “it is no longer business as usual for North Carolina's budget. I want all our citizens to know it is a new day. Everything is on the table. We don’t have time for talk-show political posturing or petty partisan games. Not on my watch.”

I’m pretty much <http://www.carolinajournal.com/jhdailyjournal/display_jhdailyjournal.html?id=5292>on Perdue’s page on this issue, so she must have been talking about the posturing of <http://ncspin.com/>some other talk show panelist.

Then the governor said that “cutting the fat” was “a cliché that does not go far enough.” Funny, the misuse of that phrase is one of my pet peeves, too. When politicians complain that proposed savings in a government budget go beyond cutting fat” to “cutting muscle and bone,” they inadvertently reveal a lack of understanding and perspective.

When households and businesses enter tough times and have to cut back to keep their expenditures and revenues in line, they don’t have the luxury of simply cutting, well, luxuries.

Most budgets aren’t chock full with such true “fat” in the first place. They include programs, contracts, and employees that were obviously considered valuable when first added – but when the situation changes, when revenues fall short of projections and other priorities present themselves, these expenditures have to be trimmed.

That is, at least, how budgeting is accomplished in the private sector. <http://www.carolinajournal.com/jhdailyjournal/display_jhdailyjournal.html?id=5256>Governments should apply similar principles.

After repeating her <http://www.carolinajournal.com/jhdailyjournal/display_jhdailyjournal.html?id=5273>lame Mark Sanford joke and presenting some garden-variety exhortations about education reform – it’s clearly important, but we’ve pretty much heard it all before from past “education governors” – Perdue returned to her core message and hammered it home with this rousing bit of fiscal populism:

This is the time to stand up to the sweet seductions of special interests, the temptations of politically popular pork barrel spending, and end the practice of backroom dealing. Those days are gone. We cannot afford them in these perilous times. Our first and only duty is to stand by North Carolina families. That is why we are here.

I agree entirely. Do the leaders of the General Assembly?

Obama Outlines Education Reform Plans   President Obama yesterday outlined his plans for education reform
in a <http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/03/10/obamas-remarks-on-education-2/>speech to the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

The address is receiving largely positive media coverage, with a number of print stories and analyses crediting the President with taking on the teachers' unions, considered a key Democratic constituency.

The <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/us/politics/11web-educ.html?hp>New York Times says Obama called for "sweeping changes" in a speech that "reflected his party's belief that education at all levels was underfinanced in the Bush years and that reform should encompass more than demands that schools show improved test scores." Obama, however, also "showed a willingness to challenge teachers' unions and public school systems, and to continue to demand more accountability."

<http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19824.html>The Politico says Obama "for the first time confronted a powerful constituency in his own party: teachers' unions." He did so when he "proposed spending additional money on effective teachers in up to 150 additional school districts, fulfilling a campaign promise that once earned him boos from members of the National Education Association. ...

Obama Outlines Education Reform Plans   President Obama yesterday outlined his plans for education reform in a <http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/03/10/obamas-remarks-on-education-2/>speech to the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The address is receiving largely positive media coverage, with a number of print stories and analyses crediting the President with taking on the teachers' unions, considered a key Democratic constituency. The <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/us/politics/11web-educ.html?hp>New York Times says Obama called for "sweeping changes" in a speech that "reflected his party's belief that education at all levels was underfinanced in the Bush years and that reform should encompass more than demands that schools show improved test scores." Obama, however, also "showed a willingness to challenge teachers' unions and public school systems, and to continue to demand more accountability." <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19824.html>The Politico says Obama "for the first time confronted a powerful constituency in his own party: teachers' unions." He did so when he "proposed spending additional money on effective teachers in up to 150 additional school districts, fulfilling a campaign promise that once earned him boos from members of the National Education Association. ... Obama's embrace of merit pay won't go over well among a group that often provides key funding and foot soldiers for Democratic campaigns." Similarly, the <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123668036405881929.html>Wall Street Journal reports Obama proposed "ideas long troubling to teachers' unions."
      However, the <http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_education;_ylt=Ar8C7gor9l8.11aR_cgAKxZp24cA>AP notes that "despite their history on the issues, union leaders publicly welcomed Obama's words, saying it seems clear he wants to include them in his decisions."

The <http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-education11-2009mar11,0,5407359.story>Los Angeles Times says "much of" the speech "focused not on detailing federal programs but on encouraging Americans to raise the standards on their own."

Obama Trying To Do Too Much?   Under the headline "WH Hits 50-day Mark With Pride," <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19860.html>The Politico reports that "the White House is declaring that Americans should be 'proud' of all the new president has gotten done." ABC World News reported, "Creating jobs and fixing the economy, of course, are cornerstones of...Obama's administration, hardly a day has gone by during his first 50 days in office that he hasn't spoken about those issues. But his agenda has been chock full of other initiatives, as well. And that's the rub. ... In a time of economic crisis...some question attempting to do so much simultaneously." NBC Nightly News similarly reported, "The President's first seven weeks have been a whirlwind with often dramatic movement in all directions, on all fronts...which raises the question, talked about on cable all day long. Is it all too much for any one administration?"
      Fox News' Special Report said Congressional Republicans "complained that...Obama and Democrats are taxing too much, spending too much and borrowing too much. They say this is their mantra for the weeks and months ahead."  ABC World News  also reported "some critics say that President Obama is spending too much money and getting too little bang for the buck. Today, a leading Democratic economist, Mark Zandi, said that the administration's stimulus package would create 1 million fewer jobs than the White House has predicted."
      Obama "Approval Index" At New Low   Fox News' Special Report also reported, "Rasmussen's tracking poll shows the difference between people who approve of the President's performance and those who do not. It is the smallest since he took office. Rasmussen calls this the 'Presidential Approval Index,' it stands at six," with "38% approving 32% disapproving."

Conrad: Obama Budget Doesn't Have The Votes   <http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/conrad-obama-budget-lacks-votes-2009-03-10.html>The Hill reports Sen. Kent Conrad, Senate Budget Committee chairman, said yesterday that President Obama's proposed budget "doesn't have enough support from lawmakers to pass." Conrad "urged White House budget director Peter Orszag not to 'draw lines in the sand' with lawmakers, most notably on Obama's plan for a cap-and-trade system to curb carbon emissions." According to the <http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_on_go_co/obama_obstacles;_ylt=At2br5muvXKT7UBOvZmK_gNp24cA>AP reports "Conrad himself is part of Obama's problem. He is among those who oppose the president's bid to eliminate subsidies to farms with more than $500,000 in annual sales." The AP adds that "also unpopular with many Democratic lawmakers is the president's proposal to reduce the tax deductibility of mortgage payments and charitable gifts by households making more than $250,000 a year." House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel "said he worries there would be fewer donations to groups that help the needy 'during a time of crisis.'" <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19833.html>The Politico reports Sen. Chuck Grassley is "fired up about...Obama's plan to trim some Medicare reimbursement rates that may disproportionately affect rural populations." Said Grassley, "I want to make sure if we have a national system of health care it is going to deliver the same thing in Iowa as it does in California, because for 40 years it didn't."

Senate OKs Earmark-Loaded Omnibus   The <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031002653.html?hpid=topnews>Washington Post reports the Senate "gave final approval last night to a $410 billion spending bill to fund most of the federal government for the remainder of the year after overcoming a resilient Republican opposition and several Democratic defections." The bill "includes thousands of controversial earmarks inserted by members of both parties." President Obama "has indicated that he will sign the legislation despite having misgivings about the earmarks." The <http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-obama-spending11-2009mar11,0,4597897.story>Los Angeles Times reports Sen. John McCain "repeatedly attacked the spending bill," saying yesterday, "Somehow it has been accepted around here that earmarks are a standard practice. ... The message is that it is business as usual here in Washington, while unemployment is 8.1%. ... If the president were serious about his pledge for change he would veto this bill. He won't."
      According to <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19855.html>The Politico, "just to get to the final cloture roll call," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "had to first beat back a series a series of politically punishing Republican amendments." The Politico adds that "the most dangerous was offered by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) requiring the House and Senate to vote on any future cost-of-living increases for lawmakers rather than allow the pay adjustment to take effect automatically." <http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/senate-passes-410b-omnibus-2009-03-10.html>The Hill also refers to Vitter's amendment as the "biggest test of the omnibus," adding that "had the Senate adopted" it, the Senate "could have scuttled the omnibus."
      The <http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_on_go_co/congress_spending>AP says that "within Democratic ranks, there was relief, not jubilation." The <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672969713289289.html>Wall Street Journal notes the vote "did not fall strictly along party lines. The eight Republicans who supported the bill included members of the Senate Appropriations Committee who had helped to draft it." Three Democrats, Sens. Evan Bayh, Russ Feingold and Claire McCaskill "opposed the bill as wasteful," and those "defections were small but could signal problems for Mr. Reid as he tries to hold his troops together as Congress faces an array of complex bills."
      Cuba Travel Restrictions Eased   <http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090310/ts_afp/useconomypoliticscongress_20090310234833>AFP notes the measure "eases Cold War-inspired restrictions on Cuba," blocking "enforcement of rules that keep Cuban-Americans from visiting their homeland more than once every three years, allowing them to visit once per year instead. It would also expand the definition of 'close relative' to allow Cuban-Americans to visit cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts, and uncles, in addition to parents, grandparents, children and siblings." The bill "would allow Cuban-Americans to spend up to 179 dollars per day while in Cuba, and would also ease some restrictions on food and medicine sales to Cuba -- but it does not lift the US embargo." The <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/13255f80-0dbe-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html>Financial Times says the change marks "the most concrete sign yet of a softer approach under...Obama to the hemisphere's longest-running dispute."

As He Exits Stage, Obama Nominee Blasts "Israel Lobby"   <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19856.html>The Politico reports Charles W. Freeman's "abrupt withdrawal from his appointment as chairman of the National Intelligence Council came after he drew fire on a number of fronts -- including questions about his financial ties to China and Saudi Arabia." The Politico adds, however, that "the most heated opposition came from supporters of Israel - and Freeman's departure shows Obama's reluctance to signal a dramatic change to a U.S. policy in the Middle East." Freeman "left no doubt about where he places blame in a written statement after his withdrawal. 'The libels on me and their easily traceable email trails show conclusively that there is a powerful lobby determined to prevent any view other than its own from being aired, still less to factor in American understanding of trends and events in the Middle East,' he wrote. 'The tactics of the Israel Lobby plumb the depths of dishonor and indecency and include character assassination, selective misquotation, the willful distortion of the record, the fabrication of falsehoods, and an utter disregard for the truth.'"
      The <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/48f8eb04-0dc8-11de-8ea3-0000779fd2ac.html>Financial Times reports Freeman "stepped down after a barrage of criticism from the pro-Israel lobby," while <http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/controversial-intel-pick-withdraws-2009-03-10.html>The Hill says he withdrew "after facing strong opposition from Senate Republicans." The <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031003223.html?hpid=topnews>Washington Post reports that Rep. Steve Israel "one of the first congressmen to raise questions about Freeman...said yesterday that he spoke of his concerns last week to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and later sent him materials about the former ambassador's statements and associations."
      The <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123671973608687743.html>Wall Street Journal notes that "just hours earlier," DNI Dennis Blair "had defended Mr. Freeman at a Senate hearing under sharp questioning from Sen. Joseph Lieberman." The Journal reports "critics called Mr. Freeman anti-Israel and cited a comment in which he said the Chinese government acted too slowly to crack down on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989." According to the <http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090311/ap_on_go_ot/intel_official_saudi;_ylt=AhbCBPndTLQSfEgRf8R6Pe9p24cA>AP, "Freeman's financial, personal and business ties with the governments of China and Saudi Arabia have also been called into account. He was president of the Middle East Policy Council, which received some funding from the Saudi government, and he is on the international board of advisers to a Chinese-government owned oil company."

'If you paid the 20 grand for the poll, you can get some information out of it.'" <http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/63698.html>McClatchy adds, "When a reporter asked if Bunning's decision to keep the poll numbers private infers that he isn't happy with the results, he responded: 'You are going to infer any damn thing you choose, so why should I try to influence it.'"

Poll Shows Dodd Endangered   <http://www.politico.com/blogs/scorecard/0309/Dodd_trails_Simmons.html>The Politico reports a new Quinnipiac University poll of 1,238 registered Connecticut voters taken March 3-8 shows former Rep.

Madigan Tops Quinn In Zogby Poll   The <http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/burris/1468666,CST-NWS-poll10.article>Chicago Sun-Times reports that a Zogby International online survey of 644 likely Illinois voters conducted Feb. 20- 23 shows Illinois AG Lisa Madigan (D) leading Illinois Gov.

Capping Charter School Success

By <http://www.carolinajournal.com/cjcolumnists/display_author.html?id=313>Kristen Blair

March 12, 2009


Research on charter schools generally shows these innovative public schools boost achievement. Critics aren't convinced. Charter students might excel, they counter, but such success is preprogrammed before school even starts.

Here's a look at their logic:
Parents who seek out charter schools are highly invested and involved, and these familial qualities -- not educational factors intrinsic to the schools -- produce student achievement.
This argument has obvious ramifications for the charter movement's growth: If these schools have a negligible impact on academic outcomes, who needs more of them?

The city of Boston just might.

In a new report sure to confound critics, Boston charter school students outperformed their traditional school peers, even when the students had parents who were similarly engaged. The study's Harvard and MIT researchers, commissioned by the Boston Foundation, did conduct standard observational comparisons of all of Boston's traditional, charter, and pilot schools (public alternatives created by the teachers' union and school district).

But they also addressed concerns over family bias, following the performance of two groups of equally matched kids who all sought entrance to high-demand charter and pilot schools via an admissions lottery.

Lottery winners who enrolled in charter or pilot schools constituted one group. Students who lost the lottery and remained in traditional public schools made up a comparison group. In terms of family background, though, this was one homogeneous bunch.

"At the time of admission, the only difference between applicants who were offered admission and those who were not was a coin flip," affirmed lead researcher Thomas Kane in a
press release.

But what a coin flip it was: Charter students' achievement rose in every category compared to their traditional school counterparts.

Middle school math performance was particularly impressive: Just one year in a charter school increased student achievement by the equivalent of 19 percentage points -- a finding deemed "nothing short of remarkable" by Boston Foundation President Paul Grogan.

Moreover, charters produced higher test scores in both lottery-based and observational comparisons. Pilot school results were mixed and inconclusive.

The Boston research augments earlier lottery-based studies from economist Caroline Hoxby showing New York City and Chicago charter schools bolstered student performance. Taken together, these data will undoubtedly catalyze charter expansion efforts: Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois all restrict the number of charter schools operating statewide.

Such findings have implications for North Carolina's charter movement as well. Why?

Statewide, charter school demand greatly exceeds supply. Here as elsewhere, high-demand charters with more applicants than spots must conduct annual lotteries each spring to determine enrollment.

A recent Carolina Journal survey found at least 57 of the state's 97 charter schools had 2008-09 wait lists. At five schools, wait lists topped 1,000 students.

Some schools, though, have struggled academically. Others have mismanaged their finances. But the charter system provides for these contingencies. Unlike traditional public schools, chronically underperforming or troubled charter schools are shut down.
State tallies indicate 38 charter schools have closed since 1997. Several more may follow.

Overall, though, North Carolina's charter movement is flourishing. Yet we cannot replicate charters' achievements. Our 100-school charter cap arbitrarily limits growth.

Supportive state lawmakers have sought repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- to repeal the cap. They are trying again this 2009 session.

Let's hope they prevail this time. Currently, thousands of students across the state await the outcome of crowded charter lotteries. Charters are reforming public education and helping kids achieve.

Why would anyone want to cap that kind of success?

Doc June,

"Educational performance is clearly tied to teacher quality."

Hood's point is precisely, indisputably on target.

(And I bet you can recall its truth from your own eddication . . . .)

Increase classroom population, fire as many incompetent teachers as possible (without shutting down
the whole system!) reduce the layers of overpaid, feckless bureaucrats - - & yes, reward the performers.

Nothing new.  O:-)   No new committees, no new studies (by outrageously-paid consultants). Kumbaya based
not on fantasy but real world.

Oh, eliminate the seminars in hi-dollar surroundings. And I didn't even mention a bus!

The classroom is where the formal action is. You've probably eaten at a Golden Corral Buffet & Grill.
(And no, no one need sample each of hundreds of offerings!) Way back as the chain was getting
started, I heard co-founder James Maynard say, "The store is where the cash register is." High level
executive hires were trained in the store (including policing the parking area!) to emphasize that sales
& earnings came from performance in serving those who paid: customers.

(BTW Golden Corral waitresses earned at the level of those at the Angus Barn.)

Pls recall public charter schools as a cost-saving choice, an option that must succeed or be shut down.

Making The Grade in Teacher Quality  [excerpt]
By John Hood

March 17, 2009

RALEIGH – As state legislators, the Perdue administration, and others begin to debate budget-savings recommendations this week,
<http://johnlocke.org/press_releases/display_story.html?id=470>http://johnlocke.org/press_releases/display_story.html?id=470
you can expect to hear a lot of talk about state spending on education, particularly for classroom teachers.

The debate is important, but its terms are miscast. Educational performance is clearly tied to teacher quality, which is itself tied to
a variety of state policies and variables. Policymakers shouldn’t think they are determining the effectiveness of instruction in
North Carolina public schools through the appropriations process.

Teacher quality is not simply a product of state expenditure.

Aw, come on, Ms Carolyn:

      a 7% increase for the university system throws you into a  state  of great confusion?

Your NCLeg bio shows 4 terms in the House: where you been, ma'am?  O:-)   (H'mm, could you jes' be the designated
Casablanca performer: Shocked! Shocked!)

Last this unwashed looked, the whole NC eddicrat apparat was part of the NC Democrat political system!  :'(
The spending boost that perturbs you confirms the Mutual Adulatory Gang.

That system delivers deliciously for special interests & their kept lot in state gov't. Moreover my alma mater,
Carolina (Go Tar Heels) is a taxpayer-funded sanctum of failed Dems doing politics by other means, eg., John Edwards
notably comes tyo mind.

And you do know the Duke of Dare has honorary doctorate from UNC-CH? <http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr99/degrees.htm>www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr99/degrees.htm
A reward to the Pro Tem for directing $$$s to UNC-CH. (But not one for the world-changer - - for liberty, Jesse Helms.)

BTW in 1972 - - which gave NC the first Republican governor in 1000 years & Ol' Jess the Venerable Sen Helms - -
one bumper sticker read:
                                     VOTE REPUBLICAN
                                     FOR A CHANGE

Maybe my R betters will resurrect that clear, powerful double entendre?

(For my fellow ol' geezer Rs, remember another in 1972 heady days: GIVE  'EM HELMS & HOLSHOUSER!)

Fern Shubert, call your office pls . . . .

" . . . Rep. Carolyn Justice, R-Pender said she found it difficult to believe spending for the university system would see a 7 percent growth
when all she has heard is how deep the cuts were going to be.
“I don’t understand how there is such a huge jump in university spending compared with community colleges and public schools,” Justice said.
“Even in the worst times, the university system always gets a huge jump. Why is that? I do find it perturbing.”

Honorables  :-)

As I recall, several Republican members of NCGA were advancing public safety & criminal justice
concerns in 2003 - - at the time kumbaya pols & media were reveling in the co-speakership of
the Democrat crook, House Speaker Jim Black (now in Federal prison) & his toady, Republican
Richard Morgan (now back on the farm) . . . .

H'mm, anybody got a count of the cost of that idiocy - - & what were the more pressing concerns
commanding attention of the self-servers, ugh!

And present day, what is cost of the assorted PR bureaucracies across state government - - jes' to
suggest one area of cost-cutting . . .  .

Warm good wishes for service of citizens, transparency, accountability, fairness, honesty . . . .

Public safety budget proposals debated

By: Loretta Boniti


RALEIGH – Less than 24 hours after Gov. Bev Perdue released her 2009-2011 budget, legislators and advocates were asking a lot of questions
Wednesday about her plans for justice and public safety spending.
Lawmakers and advocates say some of Perdue's proposals could be beneficial, while others might make things worse than they are now.

"It is critical that we go not too far with cuts, and we will do everything we can to be more efficient and we will eliminate some positions, but it is
critical that we not go too far," says N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper.

But lawmakers must now decide where to draw the line.

Speaking on behalf of the administration, Secretary of Correction Alvin Keller told a legislative committee that one proposal he strongly supports
is shutting down several prisons across the state.

"We want to be efficient and we've determined that by making the closures that we have made, that we are doing just that," Keller said.

But some lawmakers argue that while these prison closures might do some good for the correctional system's bottom line, it could hurt some
local communities.

"When we have turned to making our prisons engines of economic development, we have boxed ourselves in a corner," said state Rep. Alice Bordsen,
D-Alamance County. "So it becomes almost secondary to individual members whose districts will be damaged whether that prison is run efficiently
or not."

Prison closures aren't the only public safety concerns from Perdue's proposals. One of her 20 program cuts would get rid of the Sentencing Services
Program. The program makes sentencing recommendations to judges, which the group says saves the state a lot more money than it costs to run.

"Just last fiscal year alone, we saved the state, including the cost of probation for the people we diverted from prison, over $13 million," Susan Brooks,
of the Sentencing Services Program, said.

Under the governor's proposals, the McCain Correctional Hospital and the Wilmington Residential Facility for Women would close. Perdue is also
recommending the shutdown of correctional centers in the Umstead, Guilford, Gates, Haywood and Union locations.

Most of the seven facilities would not shut their doors for two years.
