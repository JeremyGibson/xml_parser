<http://www.centre4sinai.com.eg/Palestine.htm>Palestine O Palestine!

Reminiscence of the <http://www.mideastweb.org/pal1200.htm>Ancient time!

The <http://www.lukemastin.com/history/ancient_middle_east.html>first recorded civilization of human kind

Once prosperous City-States of creative minds!



<http://www.netours.com/2003/landbridge.htm>Linking ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Assyria -

Your culture and goods reached ancient China and India!

A free land with high spirit known in history as <http://www.crystalinks.com/canaan.html>Canaan

Where vibrant communities celebrated life by the Mediterranean!



Your peaceful festive society and culture -

Ended with <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Bible-God-Violent-partisan.htm>Partisan God‚Äôs worldly adventure!

As <http://www.habtoor.com/thinkingclearly/html/issue37.htm>Israelites burned your civilization with <http://www.kolki.com/peace/THE-INVASION-OF-CANAAN.htm>deadly massacre!

Ending thriving natural life style in nightmare!

Inflicting endless diasporic migration of despair!



You witnessed wars, occupations, annihilation in repetition!

Bloodshed and revenge covered once pure land with pollution!

Influx of people found home surviving migratory persecution -

Some destroyed you while others blended in cultural unification!†



Your modern democracy was <http://www.revisionisthistory.org/palestine52.html>destroyed at inception -

As the powerful <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre>evil force besieged you with <http://www.jmcc.org/new/02/apr/destruction.htm>obsession!

But you <http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june06/palestine_1-25.html>rose again from the ashes of oppression

As an inspiration to the dream of worldwide <http://socialismandliberation.org/mag/index.php?aid=144>freedom!

Without <http://www.christianzionism.org/Articles.asp>Zionist Evangelical Dream of making <http://www.prospectstampsandcoins.com.au/web/special_releases/index.html>Pope the King of The United Kingdom of Israel (The New World) †ancient Jews/Hebrews and Palestinians of Canaan would have lived peacefully since signing the OSLO peace treaty despite the fact that the Palestinians lost 87% of their land to the new State of Israel!



But the problem is that the Zionists and Zion‚Äôs Christian Soldiers want the entire Palestine without the Palestinians which is Genocide! That is why <http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1994/>Arafat-Rabin peace treaty ended in <http://bellaciao.org/en/spip.php?article18010>Bush-Sharon-Olmert road to Palestinian blood!



[Let us hear from the leader of Zion‚Äôs Christian Soldiers Rev. John Hagee speaking in Washington D.C, on July 17, 2007, during ‚ÄúA Night to Honour Israel‚Äù that was hosted by Christians United for Israel [CUFI] and attended by 4500 religious leaders, politicians and lobbyists including ex-CIA directors:



†‚ÄúWhen 50 million evangelical Bible-believing Christians unite with five million American Jews

standing together on behalf of Israel, it is a match made in heaven. Let us shout it from the housetops that a new day has been born in America. The sleeping giant of Christian Zionism has awakened. If a line has to be drawn, draw the line around Christians and Jews. We are united. We are indivisible. And together we can reshape history.‚Äù



Pastor John Hagee, also stated, ‚ÄúThe United States must join Israel in a pre-emptive military strike against Iran to fulfill God's plan for both Israel and the West... a biblically prophesied end-time confrontation with Iran, which will lead to the Rapture, Tribulation [...]and Second Coming of Christ‚Äù (CUFI‚Äôs Washington, DC inaugural event, July 19, 2006).

Ref: <http://www.christianzionism.org/Article/Burge02.pdf>http://www.christianzionism.org/Article/Burge02.pdf , <http://www.christianzionism.org/Articles.asp>http://www.christianzionism.org/Articles.asp ]



Here is an excerpt from the Book of Revelations, New Testament: ‚ÄúThe final battle in the history of the future will be fought on an ancient battlefield in northern Israel called Armageddon. It will follow seven years of tribulation during which the earth will be shaken by such disasters that previous human history will seem like a day in the country. The blood will rise as high as a horse‚Äôs bridle at Armageddon, before Christ triumphs to begin his 1,000-year rule‚Äù.

And here is Pastor John Hagee again, ‚ÄúAnd the Jews? Well, two-thirds of them will have been wiped out by now. But the survivors will accept Jesus at last‚Äù.

<http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/03/60minutes/main524268.shtml>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/03/60minutes/main524268.shtml



The questions are: 1. Who is this Christ (obviously not <http://www.kolki.com/poems/Jesus.doc>Jesus!) and 2. Who are those Jews (non-Zionist world citizens!) whom the united Zion‚Äôs Christian Soldiers and the Euro-American Jews planning to wipe out?

Doesn‚Äôt it resemble Hellenistic dream of Messiah Like Alexandrian Cross instead of loving Jesus concurring the world again only sitting this time on a pile of Nuclear and Biological weapons to wipe out two-third of world population leaving Aristocratic Dorian Greeks to rule the Promise World using remaining ¬ºth world population as converted† slaves? This is the big picture that most scholars/academicians/politicians/social thinkers are trying to avoid addressing leaving the fate of the world at the hands of imprudent Pastors like John Hagee and his religious and political sympathisers!†

World citizens must ask isn‚Äôt Mr. John Hagee acting like a super Terrorist who is preaching ‚ÄòEnd of the World‚Äô to reshape history in his advantage at the cost of the world as we know of and all it‚Äôs people except few chosen ones like him and his likeness? <http://www.kolki.com/poems/SayingofKolki.htm>Kolki

I have a President

(Dedicated to Wise, Honourable, Loving, and Caring Presidents ‚Äì Deepak Sarkar, <http://www.kolki.com/>www.kolki.com)



Now I have a President!

After eight years of <http://www.kolki.com/poems/Nightmares.htm>Nightmares

That enshrouded America since year <http://liesofbush.com/2000election.shtml>2000 Election Fraud

Disobeying constitution and will of voters

Installing <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1848303.stm>Shadow Government following <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Real-Path-To-9-11.htm>9/11 disaster

Taking the Nation back to Monarchial Past

Staging unilaterally endless <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1848303.stm>illegal wars

Ruling citizens with convenient rumours of fear

Attacking countries at peace afar

Failing distressed citizens during <http://www.alternet.org/katrina/26349/>Katrina flood

Numbing Senate and Congress with <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Anthrax-Proof-UN.htm>anthrax, <http://www.agreeley.com/articles/041307.html>lies and <http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/17/bush.nsa/>wire taps

<http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/05/nation/na-budget5>Looting treasury to enrich private Banks and Military commerce

To empower Israel (<http://www.preteristarchive.com/PartialPreterism/provan-charles_dd_01.html>church), the <http://www.stanfords.co.uk/articles/blog/london-the-new-jerusalem,266,AR.html>New Jerusalem and the <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Developed-Constitutional-Monarchies.htm>Monarchs!



But I am afraid, Mr New President

‚ÄòEverything is not possible‚Äô yet, as you said!

Soon you will be acting under the <http://www.sweetliberty.org/shadow.htm>shadow government

That inherited America since <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Real-Path-To-9-11.htm>9/11

Following <http://www.kolki.com/peace/NewPearlHarbour.htm>Evangelical protocols for the <http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/03/60minutes/main524268.shtml>chosen

Letting <http://www.kolki.com/poems/Felons.htm>felons torture innocents at the <http://www.kolki.com/poems/Guantanamo-Bay.htm>Guantanamo Bay

Rewarding status quo that failed Citizens in every which way

Honouring <http://www.historycommons.org/project.jsp?project=us_torture_abuse>abusers still enjoying limelight with respect!

But, ‚ÄòWhere there is a will there is way‚Äô!

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶



If everything was possible in America ‚Äì

You would be bold enough to say

Bring all <http://www.kolki.com/peace/What-Is-Al-Qaeda.htm>terror suspects to open judgement

Hold Ex-President liable for <http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/23/bush.iraq/>lies holding Bible

Open inquiry to justify <http://www.kolki.com/poems/War-of-Terror.htm>war on terror and military expense

Convict State Department, Congress, and Senate †

For breeding and contracting <http://www.democracynow.org/2007/3/20/blackwater_the_rise_of_the_worlds>mercenaries inside USA!



I only wish and pray on behalf of fellow citizens

That <http://www.kolki.com/poems/Universal-God.htm>God gives you the vision to see things straight

Emboldening your courage and self respect

Helps you arouse the nation with one voice

Leading to ‚Äò<http://www.kolki.com/poems/American-Orange-Revolution.htm>American Orange Revolution‚Äô the only choice

†To break the barriers of <http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/CIAtimeline.html>covert intelligence

Freeing media from obsessive loyalty to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird>Central Intelligence

Bailing out citizens from immoral mortgage and insurance!

Finally, helping people march on singing with universal gospels ‚Äì

‚ÄòBlessed are the peacemakers‚Äô

‚ÄòBlessed are the truth seekers‚Äô

‚ÄòBlessed are the ones who rise above fear‚Äô

‚ÄòBlessed help create an egalitarian world‚Äô!

And

<http://www.kolki.com/peace/Real-Path-To-9-11.htm>Real Path To 9/11 ñ A Barrier To Peace, Universal Well Being and Good Environment]



Dear Mr. President,



Subject: What is Recovery (Economic as well)? We must address the causes of recession for real remedy!



Once again, Congratulations! Thanks for standing tall for the Americans and world citizens!



The recovery means stopping the bleeding first and then search for the cause(s)

of bleeding as diagnosis and apply appropriate corrections for prognosis!



If you recall George W. Bush inherited the presidency from President Clinton with a Surplus Economy! What most economists, scholars, and academics as well as politicians donít address or are afraid to address is that the massive irresponsible tax cuts and military spending without accountabilities led to this massive economic disaster; sub prime lending Is just a side effect as after effect!



To add fuel to the fire, without 9/11 public investigation, the suspected real <http://www.kolki.com/peace/Real-Path-To-9-11.htm>9/11 perpetrators were and had been running the country holding key positions with total disrespect for the American and Humane values. The bailouts without accountabilities are the worst examples of Government giving in to the private extremists!



Just imagine that an ordinary law abiding citizen has to submit a viable project or application with all credentials to obtain even a small business loan or home loan! Then it is obvious that nation doesnít understand economy why they are bailing out the richest out of unknown fear!



Also, imagine a corporation is being run by executives who were responsible for the failure of the corporation and the board of directors just rewarding them for their failures Instead of punishing them to save the corporation! That corporation is only heading for the foreclosure! Now imagine - that corporation is America!††



I hope that your administration acts before it is too late for true recovery! Because without addressing the very cause of the recession which is systematic aristocrative looting of the treasury - history might repeat bringing back Kennedy misery!



I know that you are helpless in many ways including your security but ëGod helps those who helps themselvesí and you are the living proof of that statement.



You can use the same techniques the way you took your campaign for presidency to the Grassroots to arouse American consciousness about 9/11, related corruptions, and sophisticated payouts and bailouts what leading America to a point of no return! We must not forget, ëRoma wasnít built in dayí, and so is USA!



I wish you all the best and my thoughts and prayers would be always there for overall well being of America and the world.



With warmest regards!
