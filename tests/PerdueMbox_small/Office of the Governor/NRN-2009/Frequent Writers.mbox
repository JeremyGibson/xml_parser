<http://stw.jdrf.org/UploadUserProfilePicture/24998464-af4c-48cc-9939-4ec17ff95e7d.jpg>Dear Friend,

Diabetes has had a profound effect on my life and those of my friends, family and loved ones. As you may know, type 1 (juvenile) diabetes is a devastating disease, and while insulin does keep people with type 1 diabetes alive, it‚Äôs NOT a cure. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm committed to fighting for a cure through the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation‚Äôs (JDRF) advocacy program. Please join me in this effort to make a cure for type 1 diabetes a reality.

JDRF‚Äôs success is built on a close-knit group of Advocates determined to tell their stories of living with type 1 to their Members of Congress. Through telling these stories and building lasting relationships with Members, our group of Advocates have been lauded by Time Magazine as ‚Äúone of the nation‚Äôs most forceful disease advocacy groups.‚Äù††

Although great strides have been made over the past few years to increase federal support for juvenile diabetes research, more needs to be done and we need your help!††

By becoming a <http://stw.jdrf.org/userProfile.aspx?UserID=4702&emailStatus=&Email=governor.office@nc.gov>JDRF Advocate, you will truly be making a difference in advancing a cure for diabetes.††
