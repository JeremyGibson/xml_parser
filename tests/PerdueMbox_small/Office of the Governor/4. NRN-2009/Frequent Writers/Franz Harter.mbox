So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

1/9/08
Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose..   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

mailed durbin the email list 5   - 18:12 EST 1/9/09

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb. 



3 gifts for Allen Colmes – gold francansense and myrrh

As The Windfarm Blows – The PBS Soap Opera of News
So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Boortz

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

11:45 EST
Ben – department of treasury stats – almost went there myself -

Right Thinkin' Boyz
-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

threatening email of student at a college caused feds to ask him questions references Virginia Tech shootings – kfyo news announcement -yes I have sent some interesting emails – they are not quite in the same vein – and if you want go there – they are older ones I bet – that should have been cleared up – you are trying to get me on whatever you can

oh this is the world we live in

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen..  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive.   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so..   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose..   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute..  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb.

So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Boortz

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind





104.1 The Truth AZ Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein the foreign right wing idiot who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh.

Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada and anti-semitic protests in Canada that the jews are being referred to as brothers of pigs only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance just the USA could be used for Germany - using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment IF it leads to a backlash if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations that may be the objective and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd it will wedge instead of having peace with Arabs we will declare on war on them some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them and you have to justify it this is one to do that the US is poor and needs a way or could use it a perfect way to restructure things this is a bit much to believe OTHER THAN Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN and they were saying to stick jews in the ovens - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler why would muslims refer to Hitler that also sounds fake a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler the Hitler and WWII references from muslims when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places yes their is Palestine /Israel BUT for the most part they had less impact than others. Though I should read about Patton and Rommel the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning along with the sentiment stirred up they will try to push me into this group THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT - it's the same game but this time used with anti-semitism - to stop any criticism of jews co-opt it overdo the criticism cause a backlash intentionally and then push others to block the criticism while it works a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that and to someone that doesn't matter- it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated that may be the plan definitely I see issues with crticism being authentically Arab andd muslim - the muslim community would be well advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this they are potentially intended to be the victims of this not the winners. In any rate using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward exposing the truth and what is the truth is. Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper expose them.



the genome stuff is not there yet we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects- you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet. - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits if you can do something like that- it would make sense to do it now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not Brave new World eventually the answer will be no I know that point will be a fight I can see others their reaction now protect me syndrome defensive - I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is they are finding the combination of genes is improtant not just a gene the genetic history tracing geneology things seems fraudulent I bet designer children is not their yet either- an activist group wil lstir up the pot as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done.



Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 



caller if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything your caller on chahasty who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases 19:23 EST 1/10/09



Chad I did Micahel Phelps advocate for psychotic drugs mom had him on that common ridllin ? - it did affect his brain he is not swift but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children create vegetables certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier- I am not designated first tier by whomever and they want me out so that what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not makes sense I am a failure of public schools and of Yale yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues CMU used to be a lower ranked school where I went and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL



NOOOooooo don;t go on twitter chad !





wow who knew there are radio stations in NC- even online that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats but they are showing their brotherly love for me.



sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov almost always happens it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it haven't reported it 17:24 Est 1/10/09 - upon reboot mistype tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above.



pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now.



I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design maybe an hour just continuously needed to spit felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system Improve on something I had already done a little head pressure as I write this there were a few other things but mainly spitting over and over and over needing to spit because saliva kept coming out this has been done before this is the worst the mucus is less this due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside. Oh happy joy I cannot write anymore it also suggests as something wasn't done the government did the I don't want to study thing a while back for months- they can't do that- I did want to work but I jsut kept spitting up and spitting up - and had to belay a couple thoughts but the spitting was the main thing it might like 14:00 Est it was 16:00 when I stopped working I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time. - It had been happening early but not quite like that. Not so intensely I was productive despite that.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records

college weathering recession best. 

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died. 

--
r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see..  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive.   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog..   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

mailed durbin the email list 5   - 18:12 EST 1/9/09

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb.

So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Boortz

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died. 

--
r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey.. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done.

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time..  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died. 

--
r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship.  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died. 

--
r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that. 


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down. 

1/11/09 – yahoo weather
13:53 EST 55 D and cloudy in Rocky mount – but it close to the VA border
13:55 EST 55 D and cloudy in Greenville NC north  and inland a ways
13:56 EST 54 D and cloudy in Raliegh – inland
13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle
14:03 EST 57 D and cloudy in Swansboro
13:48 EST 60 D and cloudy in Jacksonville
13:57 EST 63 D and cloudy in Wilmington NC
13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

-- 
Allen Hunt -

18:30 EST
will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided even;y between them.

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

6 jeeps on beach 15:44 EST 1/11/09 within viewing distance.  There should be 1-0 all day.

--
Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work.

I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain .. 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode.

18:59 EST
Bob – tartansville – not muslims against jews in Israel – muslims against world -  as sec of state caller would support good and oppose evil – I don't believe in Christian or good or evil at this point – boy we would havwe short conversations.  - next

Molly – younger brother with very erradic behavior – has job but lost friendships – party for wedding anniversary – My parents never had a big wedding anniversary – I was not expectedto plan it – it never even came up – it just wasn't done – caller makes point that brother is not Christian – host asking about her though.

circa history – bat out of hell goes to heaven – kfyo – the bomber who became Christian – 18:47 EST – convertain Japanese captain to Japanese preacher eventually – that would be a way to learn about us – blind faith yes we can

I may be the immayture one here – pact to stay in touch – caller doesn't have wife and kids – sent email – if this is my kind of family – I don't want a famly like this – family memeber thinks he needs counselling – this is dirty – H storong fiath life- caller John – Clearwater  FL -

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error.  

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work.  

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty.  

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain .

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.   

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that.  


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down.  

1/11/09 – yahoo weather
13:53 EST 55 D and cloudy in Rocky mount – but it close to the VA border
13:55 EST 55 D and cloudy in Greenville NC north  and inland a ways
13:56 EST 54 D and cloudy in Raliegh – inland
13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle
14:03 EST 57 D and cloudy in Swansboro
13:48 EST 60 D and cloudy in Jacksonville
13:57 EST 63 D and cloudy in Wilmington NC
13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now.  

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work.  

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game.  
Examples..  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship.  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late.  
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function.  

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge.  

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected.  

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick.  

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay.  

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging..  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

Caller Matt - collateral dmage with mother – she has arthriitis – get words of wisdom from priest – I'm catholic  - Matt  0-  I am not currently – or I do not practice as I do not believe in the bible as truth or in Jesus as divine – Jesus is not the Universe – nor is the christian god – I gave up catholicism – caller hurt mother- but she's mom – in my case she may have tried to kill several times throughout my life – but that will never been proven one way or another-

my parents weren't at 2 of or 3 of my college graduation – though i was only in part of 1 of those – and they split real fast out of my CMU graduation – never understood that – they did not want to meet anyone.  Now things make more sense – thatr professor – the one was trhere – he would not go inside- he stayed outside away from me – not totally surprising – it has more meaning now.

will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided evenly between them.   Up until just before she died.  - this is in NJ

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that. 


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down.

13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle

13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship.  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV..   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died. 

--
r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that..

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive.   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation..   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

mailed durbin the email list 5   - 18:12 EST 1/9/09

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb. 



3 gifts for Allen Colmes – gold francansense and myrrh

As The Windfarm Blows – The PBS Soap Opera of News
So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Boortz

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

Right Thinkin' Boyz
-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

threatening email of student at a college caused feds to ask him questions references Virginia Tech shootings – kfyo news announcement -yes I have sent some interesting emails – they are not quite in the same vein – and if you want go there – they are older ones I bet – that should have been cleared up – you are trying to get me on whatever you can

oh this is the world we live in

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

the dod site contqact form now does a catch -22 that shuts you out – it appears to work – you submit an email and a comment – to the ask a question option – but then to me a second screen comes up asking for more detailed information – name address and country  and state and email – and when I submit the email I've been using – it states it already has that email and cannot receive and it appears the comment never actually goes through – because it gets hung up on already having my email address.  20:39 Est 1/11/09

Ben Ferguson -

-15 degrees Centigrade is about 5 degrees fahrenheit if I did it right

the environmental regulations prevent us using our own oil – hmmm – interesting – who though that one up.  

small banks made the loans Ben – the home loans – I thought that was mroe a policy for the sub-prime loans only of larger banks – maybe yo uknow that. 

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging.  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that..  I hope.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters. 


Oil swaps – kind of like housing swaps I bet – and enron passed these changes , you don;t say- but whatconcerns me – this could be done in other commodity markets-  if we switch to natural gas – aka T boone pickens – they could do this all over again -  the government must have known it left the commodities market unregulated – I stopped here – aka T Boone Pickens and natural gas – they could do this all – ahh – I did get off place and I coughed and passed gas as I realized it – it's odd first of all how I stop in writing just before making a point nad get distracted – high mom -  getting way off thought and into another write the point – let me make the point – it almost might be that politicians and lawmakers leave “Some goods out for theft” on purpose – yawning as I write that – like one way to find out how criminal people are is to leave them something to take – yawning again – no one could have spotted loopholes made with enron even though they made the loopholes-  like CA legislators who profitted – got into office on the power supply mess in CA – they didn't follow through and close loopholes? - that big investigation into CA not having sufficient power to meet demand causing the crazy prices – touching thumbs and coughing – and that did not get politicians in the West at least looking seriously at what laws allowed enron to do that? - Odd fairly big detail to miss for the people that would have been lobbied for the change- very short memories there.  Hmmmm  - oh well – whole lotta speculatin' goin' on – coughing here – and next is the power supply for homes – that is the next thing they want to spike.

A good segue way into the singer  in haiti – who “made something of himself”  - songs like don;t have to be a billionairre to reach the moon – it is not innovative musically – and I wouldn't expect it to be – most popular songs aren't – in addition though it hits no substance – no practical way to acheive dreams  - doesn't urge people on a course to acheive dreams – and has no other commentary to it – now that standard would kill a lot of songbirds – many pop singers can be accussed of making derivative themed songs – they sell -  but this guy is really popular and I am saying he isn't saying that much.  - getting into an infinfinite  loop and pulling out of it making me first rest my forehad on on my righx index knuckle and then rub it on it ina circular pattern – perhaps a swirl in actuality – an odd subconcious thing to do.  Passed gas right there – hi mom – but the singer has grammies and this and that suggesting certain people are on his side – I want to keep this short- what did the Nazi party offer youth when it started like – something like food, bread, education – no actual industry not under Nazi control because of course that would delude Nazi power – you get them all working for the organization – AND – the cool part- you kill off or ensure there is no industry other than yours so that everyone is desperate and the only way to succeed is to join your organization so that you have control of all the people and how much they make and what they know – but he's so generous – and it leads to the other fun question – is what is happnening in Haiti a trail run for here? - and other places – let's use Haiti as a test ground in how to found a totalitarian state – NEATO RINO  - what neat experiments people are doing right now.  Iusn't it NEAT and COOL – how to starve a nation and buy out its industries to totally control its population by Bill Gates and warren Buffet – oops I don;t see their name on the title  . . . . . .. just yet.  Can worrying about insurance induce mental illness – insurance may give you peace of mind, but the didfferent options and being so concerned about your coverage and maybe having dellusions of a tlaking geco – I wonder if that could cause mental illness too – I have to admit that one is a stretch – cause there is nothing corrupt about the profits of the insurance industry where coverage is andated by law in many cases.   

I hd a note – ah the newshour – the only economist who knew what was right came from San francisco – and the ecnomists were partying in San Francisco as the meltdown occurred and they said little – like the global warming crew madea  big stink – mybe osme said something – but apparently not much was said. 


I do remember – for some reason – I always thought I wasn't doing the right thing, that things weren't going right – I didn't know what was happening to me, I cn say now possibly with good reason, but I wanted to say – I remember having turned 29 and getting off the bus going to my parents home – I have to walk about a mile – down the street I grew up cross a couple streams running by the raod – but I remember thinking – dam – I'm 29, I'm not dead yet, whatever else I did wrong or whatever – I'm 29 and I'm not dead so it can't be all bad, like if I am so unsuccessful than why am I still alive.  It was odd to find joy that way, that was one of the first times, but there was joy in that thought – that maybe I hadn't screwed everything up – maybe some part of it was done right – maybe there is something to be joyful in getting older and there should be – yet Mr rooney is right that most people are angry about a life that passed thme by and at their current pains instead joyful about having gotten something out of it all.  People are more bitter than I ever dreamed and for so little reason.  I know that now – it is – but I will be 35 this time if that happens-  if not I made 34 and it is greater 29 and I do not feel the time was wasted – I can live and die with that.

the dod site contqact form now does a catch -22 that shuts you out – it appears to work – you submit an email and a comment – to the ask a question option – but then to me a second screen comes up asking for more detailed information – name address and country  and state and email – and when I submit the email I've been using – it states it already has that email and cannot receive and it appears the comment never actually goes through – because it gets hung up on already having my email address.  20:39 Est 1/11/09

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law. 

pasted email list 2 accidentlaly on mccain.senate.gov 1/12/09 7:48

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”.. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

60 Minutes  1/11/09
ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country.

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that.

don't the speculator own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law. 

pasted email list 2 accidentlaly on mccain.senate.gov 1/12/09 7:48

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”.

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law. 

pasted email list 2 accidentlaly on mccain.senate.gov 1/12/09 7:48

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive.

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing..  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream..  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law.

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes..  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

13:41 Est 1/12/09 -  mistype http://www..house.gov/cantor -

www.house.gov/boehner - connection reset - message did not go throuhg first time - 13:39 ESt 1/12/09 - it may be a length error as well - I'll have to see

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” . 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me.  

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -   
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it?  

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver..  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see.  



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word.  

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before - 16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin 16:34 EST – 1/12/09


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason.

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law.

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

60 Minutes  1/11/09
ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters. 


Oil swaps – kind of like housing swaps I bet – and enron passed these changes , you don;t say- but whatconcerns me – this could be done in other commodity markets-  if we switch to natural gas – aka T boone pickens – they could do this all over again -  the government must have known it left the commodities market unregulated – I stopped here – aka T Boone Pickens and natural gas – they could do this all – ahh – I did get off place and I coughed and passed gas as I realized it – it's odd first of all how I stop in writing just before making a point nad get distracted – high mom -  getting way off thought and into another write the point – let me make the point – it almost might be that politicians and lawmakers leave “Some goods out for theft” on purpose – yawning as I write that – like one way to find out how criminal people are is to leave them something to take – yawning again – no one could have spotted loopholes made with enron even though they made the loopholes-  like CA legislators who profitted – got into office on the power supply mess in CA – they didn't follow through and close loopholes? - that big investigation into CA not having sufficient power to meet demand causing the crazy prices – touching thumbs and coughing – and that did not get politicians in the West at least looking seriously at what laws allowed enron to do that? - Odd fairly big detail to miss for the people that would have been lobbied for the change- very short memories there.  Hmmmm  - oh well – whole lotta speculatin' goin' on – coughing here – and next is the power supply for homes – that is the next thing they want to spike.

A good segue way into the singer  in haiti – who “made something of himself”  - songs like don;t have to be a billionairre to reach the moon – it is not innovative musically – and I wouldn't expect it to be – most popular songs aren't – in addition though it hits no substance – no practical way to acheive dreams  - doesn't urge people on a course to acheive dreams – and has no other commentary to it – now that standard would kill a lot of songbirds – many pop singers can be accussed of making derivative themed songs – they sell -  but this guy is really popular and I am saying he isn't saying that much.  - getting into an infinfinite  loop and pulling out of it making me first rest my forehad on on my righx index knuckle and then rub it on it ina circular pattern – perhaps a swirl in actuality – an odd subconcious thing to do.  Passed gas right there – hi mom – but the singer has grammies and this and that suggesting certain people are on his side – I want to keep this short- what did the Nazi party offer youth when it started like – something like food, bread, education – no actual industry not under Nazi control because of course that would delude Nazi power – you get them all working for the organization – AND – the cool part- you kill off or ensure there is no industry other than yours so that everyone is desperate and the only way to succeed is to join your organization so that you have control of all the people and how much they make and what they know – but he's so generous – and it leads to the other fun question – is what is happnening in Haiti a trail run for here? - and other places – let's use Haiti as a test ground in how to found a totalitarian state – NEATO RINO  - what neat experiments people are doing right now.  Iusn't it NEAT and COOL – how to starve a nation and buy out its industries to totally control its population by Bill Gates and warren Buffet – oops I don;t see their name on the title  . . .. . . .. just yet.  Can worrying about insurance induce mental illness – insurance may give you peace of mind, but the didfferent options and being so concerned about your coverage and maybe having dellusions of a talking geco – I wonder if that could cause mental illness too – I have to admit that one is a stretch – cause there is nothing corrupt about the profits of the insurance industry where coverage is andated by law in many cases.   

I hd a note – ah the newshour – the only economist who knew what was right came from San francisco – and the ecnomists were partying in San Francisco as the meltdown occurred and they said little – like the global warming crew madea  big stink – mybe osme said something – but apparently not much was said. 


I do remember – for some reason – I always thought I wasn't doing the right thing, that things weren't going right – I didn't know what was happening to me, I cn say now possibly with good reason, but I wanted to say – I remember having turned 29 and getting off the bus going to my parents home – I have to walk about a mile – down the street I grew up cross a couple streams running by the raod – but I remember thinking – dam – I'm 29, I'm not dead yet, whatever else I did wrong or whatever – I'm 29 and I'm not dead so it can't be all bad, like if I am so unsuccessful than why am I still alive.  It was odd to find joy that way, that was one of the first times, but there was joy in that thought – that maybe I hadn't screwed everything up – maybe some part of it was done right – maybe there is something to be joyful in getting older and there should be – yet Mr rooney is right that most people are angry about a life that passed thme by and at their current pains instead joyful about having gotten something out of it all.  People are more bitter than I ever dreamed and for so little reason.  I know that now – it is – but I will be 35 this time if that happens-  if not I made 34 and it is greater 29 and I do not feel the time was wasted – I can live and die with that.  You probably hear the best bedtime stories at those hours you go to sleep

What is wrong with waiting a few years and keeping our oil for ourself – kind of do you think we should live at the expense of others or is it one world – for now there is not too much wrong with waiting a few years – but the strategy of using their oil so we are the onely ones left with oil – and we can live and let them die – it would be better to try to solve energy needs together – it isn't going to work to keep oil for just us and let everyone else starve- that may make sense from a direct look at self interest – that is the strategy that leads to being Israel – with the bombs and rockets from Hamaz – we can fend them off- yes and so can Israel – it can fend off the bombs-  but it just looks like joy and a half to have to live that way – so why do that – plant the potato – don't eat it – that's why – you don;t accept that – you want to eat the potato – keep our oil for us – but that will foment terrorism – best to figure out how to save everyone – nto just us- it is doable – more than likely – maybe we need to stop holding innovation back -  I could mail a certain governor more often – I usually just respond to one thing – hmm

the environmental regulations prevent us using our own oil – hmmm – interesting – who though that one up.  

small banks made the loans Ben – the home loans – I thought that was mroe a policy for the sub-prime loans only of larger banks – maybe yo uknow that. 

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging.  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

“nobody is above the law” - Obama – meaning perhaps – I should not get a pass and he has a definition to prosecute 

“the one thing that stayed intact in my administration is the constitution”- president Bush – a swipe at Obama- for like not being legally qualified to be President by his citizenship and his small detail issue of overlooking his followers who have violated tons of people's rights under the constitution – but they are his boyss n girls and they appear above the law in the coming Obama administration – If there is one – Bush has 9 days to do something yet.

Bob – tartansville – not muslims against jews in Israel – muslims against world -  as sec of state caller would support good and oppose evil – I don't believe in Christian or good or evil at this point – boy we would havwe short conversations.  - next

Molly – younger brother with very erradic behavior – has job but lost friendships – party for wedding anniversary – My parents never had a big wedding anniversary – I was not expectedto plan it – it never even came up – it just wasn't done – caller makes point that brother is not Christian – host asking about her though. - the guy  at CCAC gym – used to use this reference – call me younger brother as a code word – I didn't get that – host made inference to gym  later in show – I've lost friends – I have less supporters – yes and how much pressure were they under.

circa history – bat out of hell goes to heaven – kfyo – the bomber who became Christian – 18:47 EST – convertain Japanese captain to Japanese preacher eventually – that would be a way to learn about us – blind faith yes we can

I may be the immayture one here – pact to stay in touch – caller doesn't have wife and kids – sent email – if this is my kind of family – I don't want a famly like this – family memeber thinks he needs counselling – this is dirty – H storong fiath life- caller John – Clearwater  FL -

Caller Matt - collateral dmage with mother – she has arthriitis – get words of wisdom from priest – I'm catholic  - Matt  0-  I am not currently – or I do not practice as I do not believe in the bible as truth or in Jesus as divine – Jesus is not the Universe – nor is the christian god – I gave up catholicism – caller hurt mother- but she's mom – in my case she may have tried to kill several times throughout my life – but that will never been proven one way or another-

my parents weren't at 2 of or 3 of my college graduation – though i was only in part of 1 of those – and they split real fast out of my CMU graduation – never understood that – they did not want to meet anyone.  Now things make more sense – thatr professor – the one was trhere – he would not go inside- he stayed outside away from me – not totally surprising – it has more meaning now. 

18:30 EST
will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided evenly between them.   Up until just before she died.  - this is in NJ

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that. 


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down. 

1/11/09 – yahoo weather
13:53 EST 55 D and cloudy in Rocky mount – but it close to the VA border
13:55 EST 55 D and cloudy in Greenville NC north  and inland a ways
13:56 EST 54 D and cloudy in Raliegh – inland
13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle

13:57 EST 63 D and cloudy in Wilmington NC
13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship.  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died.

r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that..

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive.   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation..   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb.

So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant. 

there are no steroids in baseball or football – a player said so – the sky is red

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting ..  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

13:41 Est 1/12/09 -  mistype http://www..house.gov/cantor -

www.house.gov/boehner - connection reset - message did not go throuhg first time - 13:39 ESt 1/12/09 - it may be a length error as well - I'll have to see

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” . 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that.. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law. 

pasted email list 2 accidentlaly on mccain..senate.gov 1/12/09 7:48

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.

the 700lb woman in that chair – regular 4 – legged metal chair – much like the ones I break – she's double my weight at her heaviest and at least 100-200 lbs more than me – but she can sit on a chair like that and here I broke a metal chair like that – nearly 2 – in Ct I borke a chair as I recollect and in CCAC – a theater seat came out on me as I was meeting the egyptian UN ambassador.   - by the way apparently some people have a lot of get of jail free cards – who like got rid of 50 billion -  - but let's see what happens. 

the college of Inquiry- college of something – not a college a group – but called the college of debate or   or osmething like that in Chicago- it was like a debate club-  but with dinner and the people were older – Lincoln – near the brown line – several stops from belmont – you had to buy dinner to participate – and I saw a woman there who was very left at the Harold Washington Library she apparently worked there – very Democratic-  I was good at arguing and that did impress them  - but I ahd no idea about the toes I could step on – politically – that people are very emotional about losing a debate – it's like blood. 

I did have to clean the toilets unclog them at DAM – and they would break the toilets – in DAM – like when they announced the wrong thing – wrong person as manager- Ron – when they announced him in  the old office – immediately two of the toilets were not worked – 2 out of 3 for around 100 people – guess there were 4 altogether – I found a toilet my first day not working – the cord was off - - chain had been slipped off the handle inside – I fixed that – where else- in NC – took the boating course- the toilet there had issues – and the apratment in Pittsburgh on Atwood – but the first one coming back 320 Atwood not 259 – I lived at 320 in 2000 for 6 months – learning how to fix the bath and I guess the toilet – but the bathtube would clog - - locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam.  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is.

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant. 

there are no steroids in baseball or football – a player said so – the sky is red

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting .  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job..  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

Sen Voynavich – wanting to work in a soup kitchen and not being a spring chicken – not usually something said about a Senator because except for Barack Obama who is around my years alive on this planet it is a usually not a question – another “friend” saying “hi” - and revealing the democrats feel they control the Senate of he wouldn't announce leaving – though it was a frandstand not an action. 

I would worry about competing for high student reviews-  BUT – yes they may feel any discernable difference is a problem.  But if you could single out good from bad professors – ti could be used later to fire the bad ones-  the union of professors will read a merit pay system like that – the merit is a reason to justify your job- so who doesn't get it – is getting a message they coudl be fired or not getting merit pay could be used to justify firing – which will make the union fight it in a herd behavior thing.

Mark Levin – you're preachy without substance tonight – not mroethan talking point substance- so far – a couple good thoughts at beignning – but now your staying on an issue without any substance just talking bullet points – I used to do that as a telefundraiser for hours the Republican health plan is a sham - uggghh

We Don't Need more Circumlocution in Congress - PLEASE There was Enough "Fuzzy Logic" with Global Warming it Turning into moldy Logic
I don't  why he does this Bush -yes Mr President the Economy is improving - No Mr Presidnet it may not be due tothe stimulus bailout - well it was the bailout bill - but it looked like DC handed the banks a check and give them a bigger check each than the citizens - and you did not trace the improvement to the checks-  they may both be conicdental evetns to an actual cause - it sort of goes along with your Katrina statement-  why are you becoming Obama in your last days - and circumlocuating - circumlocution is the word- I wanted a different tense that someone forgot to invent - but yes yes President is getting infected with meanie greenie logic where 1+1=3  - and we don;t need that -

ration life AND DEATH – SCARY BUT POSSIBLE. - meant lower case

Sleep leads to less sickness - tilted square people - CMU
did you screen candidates for having the virus previously used to test if people got sick CMU? -
zzzzzzz you were just trying to justify not sleeping in class.  - despite little sleep and urinary issues at times and around 5 -7 hours of sleep sometimes less – usually less- 5 – average or so – I would be an anomaly in CMU's – well no – I am not exposed very much to colds – but – that type of study a gremlin could influence- mom can make me feel sick – running nose burning throat-  ican tell the difference between real sick and gremlin sick when it's done – I would be very weary of a study saying sleep is required-  the unions want that study to say certain things – to justify more union jobs and not letting one person work harder with less sleep time.  - I just remembered – like in contracting – they don't necessarily want you moving fast-  if you move fast – you get told to slow down by your fellow workers to not make them work bad- though it depends on who your boss is.   Other bosses are better at fostering a less socialist work envrionment.  I remember a story about the city of Chicago.

- locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam.  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is.

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant.

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting .  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do..  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” . 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind..  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz..  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law.

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter.. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

60 Minutes  1/11/09
ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters. 


Oil swaps – kind of like housing swaps I bet – and enron passed these changes , you don;t say- but whatconcerns me – this could be done in other commodity markets-  if we switch to natural gas – aka T boone pickens – they could do this all over again -  the government must have known it left the commodities market unregulated – I stopped here – aka T Boone Pickens and natural gas – they could do this all – ahh – I did get off place and I coughed and passed gas as I realized it – it's odd first of all how I stop in writing just before making a point nad get distracted – high mom -  getting way off thought and into another write the point – let me make the point – it almost might be that politicians and lawmakers leave “Some goods out for theft” on purpose – yawning as I write that – like one way to find out how criminal people are is to leave them something to take – yawning again – no one could have spotted loopholes made with enron even though they made the loopholes-  like CA legislators who profitted – got into office on the power supply mess in CA – they didn't follow through and close loopholes? - that big investigation into CA not having sufficient power to meet demand causing the crazy prices – touching thumbs and coughing – and that did not get politicians in the West at least looking seriously at what laws allowed enron to do that? - Odd fairly big detail to miss for the people that would have been lobbied for the change- very short memories there.  Hmmmm  - oh well – whole lotta speculatin' goin' on – coughing here – and next is the power supply for homes – that is the next thing they want to spike.

A good segue way into the singer  in haiti – who “made something of himself”  - songs like don;t have to be a billionairre to reach the moon – it is not innovative musically – and I wouldn't expect it to be – most popular songs aren't – in addition though it hits no substance – no practical way to acheive dreams  - doesn't urge people on a course to acheive dreams – and has no other commentary to it – now that standard would kill a lot of songbirds – many pop singers can be accussed of making derivative themed songs – they sell -  but this guy is really popular and I am saying he isn't saying that much.  - getting into an infinfinite  loop and pulling out of it making me first rest my forehad on on my righx index knuckle and then rub it on it ina circular pattern – perhaps a swirl in actuality – an odd subconcious thing to do.  Passed gas right there – hi mom – but the singer has grammies and this and that suggesting certain people are on his side – I want to keep this short- what did the Nazi party offer youth when it started like – something like food, bread, education – no actual industry not under Nazi control because of course that would delude Nazi power – you get them all working for the organization – AND – the cool part- you kill off or ensure there is no industry other than yours so that everyone is desperate and the only way to succeed is to join your organization so that you have control of all the people and how much they make and what they know – but he's so generous – and it leads to the other fun question – is what is happnening in Haiti a trail run for here? - and other places – let's use Haiti as a test ground in how to found a totalitarian state – NEATO RINO  - what neat experiments people are doing right now.  Iusn't it NEAT and COOL – how to starve a nation and buy out its industries to totally control its population by Bill Gates and warren Buffet – oops I don;t see their name on the title  . . . . . .. just yet.  Can worrying about insurance induce mental illness – insurance may give you peace of mind, but the didfferent options and being so concerned about your coverage and maybe having dellusions of a talking geco – I wonder if that could cause mental illness too – I have to admit that one is a stretch – cause there is nothing corrupt about the profits of the insurance industry where coverage is andated by law in many cases.   

I hd a note – ah the newshour – the only economist who knew what was right came from San francisco – and the ecnomists were partying in San Francisco as the meltdown occurred and they said little – like the global warming crew madea  big stink – mybe osme said something – but apparently not much was said. 


I do remember – for some reason – I always thought I wasn't doing the right thing, that things weren't going right – I didn't know what was happening to me, I cn say now possibly with good reason, but I wanted to say – I remember having turned 29 and getting off the bus going to my parents home – I have to walk about a mile – down the street I grew up cross a couple streams running by the raod – but I remember thinking – dam – I'm 29, I'm not dead yet, whatever else I did wrong or whatever – I'm 29 and I'm not dead so it can't be all bad, like if I am so unsuccessful than why am I still alive.  It was odd to find joy that way, that was one of the first times, but there was joy in that thought – that maybe I hadn't screwed everything up – maybe some part of it was done right – maybe there is something to be joyful in getting older and there should be – yet Mr rooney is right that most people are angry about a life that passed thme by and at their current pains instead joyful about having gotten something out of it all.  People are more bitter than I ever dreamed and for so little reason.  I know that now – it is – but I will be 35 this time if that happens-  if not I made 34 and it is greater 29 and I do not feel the time was wasted – I can live and die with that.  You probably hear the best bedtime stories at those hours you go to sleep

Ben Ferguson -


What is wrong with waiting a few years and keeping our oil for ourself – kind of do you think we should live at the expense of others or is it one world – for now there is not too much wrong with waiting a few years – but the strategy of using their oil so we are the onely ones left with oil – and we can live and let them die – it would be better to try to solve energy needs together – it isn't going to work to keep oil for just us and let everyone else starve- that may make sense from a direct look at self interest – that is the strategy that leads to being Israel – with the bombs and rockets from Hamaz – we can fend them off- yes and so can Israel – it can fend off the bombs-  but it just looks like joy and a half to have to live that way – so why do that – plant the potato – don't eat it – that's why – you don;t accept that – you want to eat the potato – keep our oil for us – but that will foment terrorism – best to figure out how to save everyone – nto just us- it is doable – more than likely – maybe we need to stop holding innovation back -  I could mail a certain governor more often – I usually just respond to one thing – hmm

the environmental regulations prevent us using our own oil – hmmm – interesting – who though that one up.  

small banks made the loans Ben – the home loans – I thought that was mroe a policy for the sub-prime loans only of larger banks – maybe yo uknow that. 

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging.  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

“nobody is above the law” - Obama – meaning perhaps – I should not get a pass and he has a definition to prosecute 

“the one thing that stayed intact in my administration is the constitution”- president Bush – a swipe at Obama- for like not being legally qualified to be President by his citizenship and his small detail issue of overlooking his followers who have violated tons of people's rights under the constitution – but they are his boyss n girls and they appear above the law in the coming Obama administration – If there is one – Bush has 9 days to do something yet.

Molly – younger brother with very erradic behavior – has job but lost friendships – party for wedding anniversary – My parents never had a big wedding anniversary – I was not expectedto plan it – it never even came up – it just wasn't done – caller makes point that brother is not Christian – host asking about her though. - the guy  at CCAC gym – used to use this reference – call me younger brother as a code word – I didn't get that – host made inference to gym  later in show – I've lost friends – I have less supporters – yes and how much pressure were they under.

circa history – bat out of hell goes to heaven – kfyo – the bomber who became Christian – 18:47 EST – convertain Japanese captain to Japanese preacher eventually – that would be a way to learn about us – blind faith yes we can

I may be the immayture one here – pact to stay in touch – caller doesn't have wife and kids – sent email – if this is my kind of family – I don't want a famly like this – family memeber thinks he needs counselling – this is dirty – H storong fiath life- caller John – Clearwater  FL -

Caller Matt - collateral dmage with mother – she has arthriitis – get words of wisdom from priest – I'm catholic  - Matt  0-  I am not currently – or I do not practice as I do not believe in the bible as truth or in Jesus as divine – Jesus is not the Universe – nor is the christian god – I gave up catholicism – caller hurt mother- but she's mom – in my case she may have tried to kill several times throughout my life – but that will never been proven one way or another-

my parents weren't at 2 of or 3 of my college graduation – though i was only in part of 1 of those – and they split real fast out of my CMU graduation – never understood that – they did not want to meet anyone.  Now things make more sense – thatr professor – the one was trhere – he would not go inside- he stayed outside away from me – not totally surprising – it has more meaning now. 

18:30 EST
will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided evenly between them.   Up until just before she died.  - this is in NJ

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that.

1/11/09 – yahoo weather
13:53 EST 55 D and cloudy in Rocky mount – but it close to the VA border
13:55 EST 55 D and cloudy in Greenville NC north  and inland a ways
13:56 EST 54 D and cloudy in Raliegh – inland
13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle

13:57 EST 63 D and cloudy in Wilmington NC
13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship..  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died.

r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain..senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive.   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb.

So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

Sen George W Bush of TX taking Senator Hutchison's seat?  - no – sorry – yes the different shades of stone in the washington monument could possibly make someone as green as an Irishman, but they were known to hunt leprechuans – the Irishmen who had to be very clever to escape capture – I guess magic aided the leprechuans when needed – I see – wanted to say something else and I just forgot it – ah yes as an end – Never hold a competition for an architectural design – that's (like) rule #1 or more a committee of decision in architecture invariable leads to a garish mess being and this story is no different – “I am Ramses II fear me” - Percy Shelley – isn't (it) Tai-wan who now has the tallest building? - he could try my case and slap their wrists and prevent further prosecution via double jeopardy – but you're right that want me not to exist – but I do – cool I get to really be Nelson Mandella – NEATO – God does have a sense of humor as is evinced by the two different stone colors of the washington monument. 

li-ber-al – it's “cute” - it may not be accurate – you're assuming too much – best to hang a man with own words – than put the words in his mouth that you want him to say – like hannity that resembles what the Democrats did with Bush – and I thought that was stupid – you've gotta know that. 

there is a difference between knowing the mind of God and kind of getting told – in time I want you here – getting more a message – several messages – from whomever they are from – but getting told nonetheless – you're not going to wind up where you thought you were – that is different from claiming to be able to know another's thoughts – but apparently that is possible too – the perfect small bit a rain – enough to harden the sand – not enough to damage the package-  was most appreciated a few days ago.  - mother is saying hello all of sudden 6:43 EST 1/13/09

wwww.foxnews.com got into history after one use – as it was part of the history ASSuMEd it was part of the right address – and yes the wrong addresses get added – I USUALLY remember to delete a wrong address and oddly didn't see it come up or forgot in this case.   Odd that.  Yes they can help that.    And the wrong addrees error help them track the computer 1/13/09 5:58 EST - - mistype of – wwwhitehouse.gov also came up in the history – apparently a lot of bad history.   Again didn't notice missing  period looking right at it.  1/13/09 – fox commercials are crashing – loading and then stopping – like youtube – and they are silent – so I will have to reboot to hear sounnd. 6:12 EST 1/13/09 – still having that to me odd behavior where if I turn off the computer and the modem and then turn on the computer first and turn on the modem later – it doesn't connect to the internet – I have to have the modem on before I turn on the computer – so it can watch my system boot up – that was not always so – that is a new thing.   I ahve to hope that is a security feature and not a virus someone put on the computer.


How Does One Trace What Is On One's Computer
So you can find this out – but can you find out the cards drawn in the tarot reading I paid for in 2001 I guess from that magic store below marine officer's recurting center in Oakland – seeing as they didn't support the war.  And they drew the hanged man – the reader even turned it the rhe right way and not upside down – to try to make a better reading – but they were in on it too -  there was also in 1995 my first bus trip to cleveland a gypsy, fortune teller in Cleveland trying to figure out why I got thrown out of school which I did and what that was supposed to mean.  - he tried to direct me towards a resume in stead of a business the reader did – they didn't wnat me to try the business.   It's all a game. 

to even know that I had downloaded beyond from an abandonware site and I don't even know precisely when but yes it was my birthday and I know which two years – but I was alone in my own room at my own computer – which may assure my guilt – but as I never talked about it with anyone there is only one way you could know what was on my computer during my birthday which if you were watching the screen and pr 2005 – you were watching the screen of my computer – which I know or suspected that was going on – but you can't even use that in court because only with a warrant could the government do that legally and it means . . .  . - maybe it was to log and categorize everything I did on my computer from afar – it also shouldn't have been happening andthe fact that you were going there becomes to me and maybe to others the more interesting question is that people know what I was doing privately on my computer because I never talked to anyone about game playing or anythng in Pitt – there isn't a conversation about what I did at home with anyone – now perhaps you oddly got lucky and checked with the people that ran websites and maybe maybe someone could like go to my ISP and find out what sites I visited – maybe – that would be pretty thorough and I am “surprised” they would want to share precise information like that the ISP wouldn't necessarily know exactly what I was downloading or I would find it interesting if they kept records beyond what site I visted and the download shouldn't be all that chatty – but yes I suppose with very good connections you could have found out that without spying on the computer itself – realistically without a sniffer program isn't it you wouldn't have a chance in hell of finding that – still you would have to dig through the ISP to find out what I was viewing online and like I would think that shouldn't be public information – but interesting to note that nothing is private – today neither what I write longhand, what I type or what I think is private so it is an interesting world we live in.   And definitely I get that everyone knows all computer activity – but yes I am surprised that you could even find out how I celebrated I guess my 29th birthday in private-  as I thought I was alone at the time.  I doubt the ISP keeps a copy of what is downloaded though they would know you were downloading something and you could trace it to a company or the other website provider and find out.

Mark Levin – you're preachy without substance tonight – not mroethan talking point substance- so far – a couple good thoughts at beignning – but now your staying on an issue without any substance just talking bullet points – I used to do that as a telefundraiser for hours the Republican health plan is a sham – uggghh

reinvestment and recovery versus stimulus and infrastructure package – there's a good line and made point.

We Don't Need more Circumlocution in Congress - PLEASE There was Enough "Fuzzy Logic" with Global Warming it Turning into moldy Logic
I don't  why he does this Bush -yes Mr President the Economy is improving - No Mr Presidnet it may not be due tothe stimulus bailout - well it was the bailout bill - but it looked like DC handed the banks a check and give them a bigger check each than the citizens - and you did not trace the improvement to the checks-  they may both be conicdental evetns to an actual cause - it sort of goes along with your Katrina statement-  why are you becoming Obama in your last days - and circumlocuating - circumlocution is the word- I wanted a different tense that someone forgot to invent - but yes yes President is getting infected with meanie greenie logic where 1+1=3  - and we don;t need that -

Sleep leads to less sickness - tilted square people - CMU
did you screen candidates for having the virus previously used to test if people got sick CMU? -
zzzzzzz you were just trying to justify not sleeping in class.  - despite little sleep and urinary issues at times and around 5 -7 hours of sleep sometimes less – usually less- 5 – average or so – I would be an anomaly in CMU's – well no – I am not exposed very much to colds – but – that type of study a gremlin could influence- mom can make me feel sick – running nose burning throat-  ican tell the difference between real sick and gremlin sick when it's done – I would be very weary of a study saying sleep is required-  the unions want that study to say certain things – to justify more union jobs and not letting one person work harder with less sleep time.  - I just remembered – like in contracting – they don't necessarily want you moving fast-  if you move fast – you get told to slow down by your fellow workers to not make them work bad- though it depends on who your boss is.   Other bosses are better at fostering a less socialist work envrionment.  I remember a story about the city of Chicago. 

prew – itt -pruit

we're doing chest pangs a little left side. 

Sen Voynavich – wanting to work in a soup kitchen and not being a spring chicken – not usually something said about a Senator because except for Barack Obama who is around my years alive on this planet it is a usually not a question – another “friend” saying “hi” - and revealing the democrats feel they control the Senate of he wouldn't announce leaving – though it was a frandstand not an action. 

I would worry about competing for high student reviews-  BUT – yes they may feel any discernable difference is a problem.  But if you could single out good from bad professors – ti could be used later to fire the bad ones-  the union of professors will read a merit pay system like that – the merit is a reason to justify your job- so who doesn't get it – is getting a message they coudl be fired or not getting merit pay could be used to justify firing – which will make the union fight it in a herd behavior thing. 

the 700lb woman in that chair – regular 4 – legged metal chair – much like the ones I break – she's double my weight at her heaviest and at least 100-200 lbs more than me – but she can sit on a chair like that and here I broke a metal chair like that – nearly 2 – in Ct I borke a chair as I recollect and in CCAC – a theater seat came out on me as I was meeting the egyptian UN ambassador.   - by the way apparently some people have a lot of get of jail free cards – who like got rid of 50 billion -  - but let's see what happens. 

the college of Inquiry- college of something – not a college a group – but called the college of debate or   or osmething like that in Chicago- it was like a debate club-  but with dinner and the people were older – Lincoln – near the brown line – several stops from belmont – you had to buy dinner to participate – and I saw a woman there who was very left at the Harold Washington Library she apparently worked there – very Democratic-  I was good at arguing and that did impress them  - but I ahd no idea about the toes I could step on – politically – that people are very emotional about losing a debate – it's like blood. 

I did have to clean the toilets unclog them at DAM – and they would break the toilets – in DAM – like when they announced the wrong thing – wrong person as manager- Ron – when they announced him in  the old office – immediately two of the toilets were not worked – 2 out of 3 for around 100 people – guess there were 4 altogether – I found a toilet my first day not working – the cord was off - - chain had been slipped off the handle inside – I fixed that – where else- in NC – took the boating course- the toilet there had issues – and the apratment in Pittsburgh on Atwood – but the first one coming back 320 Atwood not 259 – I lived at 320 in 2000 for 6 months – learning how to fix the bath and I guess the toilet – but the bathtube would clog - - locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam.  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is. 
--
when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant. 

there are no steroids in baseball or football – a player said so – the sky is red

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


and mother made something this morning with cinamon in it which I can smell – and I did mena to take in cinamon yesterday – but forgot the whole day and she is celebrating a victory of making me forget – the point is to antagonize me.  I get that – if you make someone forget ande they don't they forgot they exactly feel bad about it – and she does many times when it suits her purposes let me know of some thought she has stolen. 

kfyo sound shut off just as I email bootz.com will have to reboot my web browser to get back kfyo 1/13/09 8:19 EST

Sen George W Bush of TX taking Senator Hutchison's seat?  - no – sorry – yes the different shades of stone in the washington monument could possibly make someone as green as an Irishman, but they were known to hunt leprechuans – the Irishmen who had to be very clever to escape capture – I guess magic aided the leprechuans when needed – I see – wanted to say something else and I just forgot it – ah yes as an end – Never hold a competition for an architectural design – that's (like) rule #1 or more a committee of decision in architecture invariable leads to a garish mess being and this story is no different – “I am Ramses II fear me” - Percy Shelley – isn't (it) Tai-wan who now has the tallest building? - he could try my case and slap their wrists and prevent further prosecution via double jeopardy – but you're right that want me not to exist – but I do – cool I get to really be Nelson Mandella – NEATO – God does have a sense of humor as is evinced by the two different stone colors of the washington monument.  -uggghh – can't we not have a civil war to make 'em see they're being bean heads and like part of the world may suffer because of it? - I wish -

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

3 times as likely to get sick - so out of hundred does like mean you got 3 cases instead of one or 99 cases instead of 33? - one result is more credible than the other - you size of sample could be big to meet the recognized scientific study requirements - but the amount of people who were actually sick could be small - they don't say that on kfyo news - CMU - but yes I get it so you are safe - good - you can tell Pittsburgh you are trying to get me to keep them off your back- they were on your back a little before I became a big issue - which is why there is CMU san Frnacisco CMU oman isn't it? 

caller s- “like cigarrettes you dependence is hooked to it so you are encouraging the behavior” – might have been telling a host to stop prompting me- pushing me to email someone – and the call ocurred just as I finished emailing the person they were prompting me to email .  - kfyo  1/13/09 8:56 Est

forgot prefix initially when submitting to hunter.house.gov – I track that – when I forget a field – happens a lot on the clintonfoundation.org.   1/13/09 8:54 EST

I do get offended the ay if a West Texan is not the speaker you feel you are doomed – you realize that is the Pittsburgh thing – like in Pittsburgh they won't combine the 400 municipalities in Allegheny so that everyone can have THEIR GUY as their elected official – BUT becasue of that attitude there is not uniformity in city services all fire departments and polciee departments and sewers and power are done differently – police do not have jurisdiction outside of a small area – could you elect an official with a good value – versus someone who “represents you” - I get very tired of that – we want our guy – yeah well we want our guy – when you get to the presidential level – that gets particularly troublesome to have that type of attitude – it's the wrong way to look at governing – good decision over your guy should take precedence – but it doesn't.       I'LL MAIL HIM ALRIGHT

I was overworried about emailing a certain not so high on the totem pole – in the can't think of the museum name – okay hold it – I'm to write this and the email queue is building – you're getting me off trying to remember I guess because someone is playing with that and I won't remember thename of museum complex – so don't qwant to dwell – I guess that is smart – I wanted to tag this with some clandestine nature – but the Lamplight district yes -that is acceptable – that's not quite right but it is good enough – I wanted to make – watching other congressmen suddenly “cut back” what they accept in email – length – which is another way of making sure they don't get meail on issues they don;t want – if you limit to 10,000 characters – you will get issues and not what I write – so I wanted to check that someone wanted this and I wasn't pushing – cause others who used to want it – are sending signals – occassionally – but you are scary and I don't want all of it – is CMU a traitor – I wouldn't put it past them – they can get email and then hand it to Obama and Nancy Pelosi – I wouldn't put it past my alma mater to sell me out – they have many people on the other side there.   How many is the question and where do their loyalties lie -should I dump them like I did Pitt.  Alright no



and mother made something this morning with cinamon in it which I can smell – and I did mena to take in cinamon yesterday – but forgot the whole day and she is celebrating a victory of making me forget – the point is to antagonize me.  I get that – if you make someone forget ande they don't they forgot they exactly feel bad about it – and she does many times when it suits her purposes let me know of some thought she has stolen.

li-ber-al – it's “cute” - it may not be accurate – you're assuming too much – best to hang a man with own words – than put the words in his mouth that you want him to say – like hannity that resembles what the Democrats did with Bush – and I thought that was stupid – you've gotta know that. 

there is a difference between knowing the mind of God and kind of getting told – in time I want you here – getting more a message – several messages – from whomever they are from – but getting told nonetheless – you're not going to wind up where you thought you were – that is different from claiming to be able to know another's thoughts – but apparently that is possible too – the perfect small bit a rain – enough to harden the sand – not enough to damage the package-  was most appreciated a few days ago..  - mother is saying hello all of sudden 6:43 EST 1/13/09

wwww.foxnews.com got into history after one use – as it was part of the history ASSuMEd it was part of the right address – and yes the wrong addresses get added – I USUALLY remember to delete a wrong address and oddly didn't see it come up or forgot in this case.   Odd that.  Yes they can help that.    And the wrong addrees error help them track the computer 1/13/09 5:58 EST - - mistype of – wwwhitehouse.gov also came up in the history – apparently a lot of bad history.   Again didn't notice missing  period looking right at it.  1/13/09 – fox commercials are crashing – loading and then stopping – like youtube – and they are silent – so I will have to reboot to hear sounnd. 6:12 EST 1/13/09 – still having that to me odd behavior where if I turn off the computer and the modem and then turn on the computer first and turn on the modem later – it doesn't connect to the internet – I have to have the modem on before I turn on the computer – so it can watch my system boot up – that was not always so – that is a new thing.   I ahve to hope that is a security feature and not a virus someone put on the computer.


How Does One Trace What Is On One's Computer
So you can find this out – but can you find out the cards drawn in the tarot reading I paid for in 2001 I guess from that magic store below marine officer's recurting center in Oakland – seeing as they didn't support the war.  And they drew the hanged man – the reader even turned it the rhe right way and not upside down – to try to make a better reading – but they were in on it too -  there was also in 1995 my first bus trip to cleveland a gypsy, fortune teller in Cleveland trying to figure out why I got thrown out of school which I did and what that was supposed to mean.  - he tried to direct me towards a resume in stead of a business the reader did – they didn't wnat me to try the business.   It's all a game. 

to even know that I had downloaded beyond from an abandonware site and I don't even know precisely when but yes it was my birthday and I know which two years – but I was alone in my own room at my own computer – which may assure my guilt – but as I never talked about it with anyone there is only one way you could know what was on my computer during my birthday which if you were watching the screen and pr 2005 – you were watching the screen of my computer – which I know or suspected that was going on – but you can't even use that in court because only with a warrant could the government do that legally and it means . . .  . - maybe it was to log and categorize everything I did on my computer from afar – it also shouldn't have been happening andthe fact that you were going there becomes to me and maybe to others the more interesting question is that people know what I was doing privately on my computer because I never talked to anyone about game playing or anythng in Pitt – there isn't a conversation about what I did at home with anyone – now perhaps you oddly got lucky and checked with the people that ran websites and maybe maybe someone could like go to my ISP and find out what sites I visited – maybe – that would be pretty thorough and I am “surprised” they would want to share precise information like that the ISP wouldn't necessarily know exactly what I was downloading or I would find it interesting if they kept records beyond what site I visted and the download shouldn't be all that chatty – but yes I suppose with very good connections you could have found out that without spying on the computer itself – realistically without a sniffer program isn't it you wouldn't have a chance in hell of finding that – still you would have to dig through the ISP to find out what I was viewing online and like I would think that shouldn't be public information – but interesting to note that nothing is private – today neither what I write longhand, what I type or what I think is private so it is an interesting world we live in.   And definitely I get that everyone knows all computer activity – but yes I am surprised that you could even find out how I celebrated I guess my 29th birthday in private-  as I thought I was alone at the time.  I doubt the ISP keeps a copy of what is downloaded though they would know you were downloading something and you could trace it to a company or the other website provider and find out.

Mark Levin – you're preachy without substance tonight – not mroethan talking point substance- so far – a couple good thoughts at beignning – but now your staying on an issue without any substance just talking bullet points – I used to do that as a telefundraiser for hours the Republican health plan is a sham – uggghh

reinvestment and recovery versus stimulus and infrastructure package – there's a good line and made point.

We Don't Need more Circumlocution in Congress - PLEASE There was Enough "Fuzzy Logic" with Global Warming it Turning into moldy Logic
I don't  why he does this Bush -yes Mr President the Economy is improving - No Mr Presidnet it may not be due tothe stimulus bailout - well it was the bailout bill - but it looked like DC handed the banks a check and give them a bigger check each than the citizens - and you did not trace the improvement to the checks-  they may both be conicdental evetns to an actual cause - it sort of goes along with your Katrina statement-  why are you becoming Obama in your last days - and circumlocuating - circumlocution is the word- I wanted a different tense that someone forgot to invent - but yes yes President is getting infected with meanie greenie logic where 1+1=3  - and we don;t need that -

Sleep leads to less sickness - tilted square people - CMU
did you screen candidates for having the virus previously used to test if people got sick CMU? -
zzzzzzz you were just trying to justify not sleeping in class.  - despite little sleep and urinary issues at times and around 5 -7 hours of sleep sometimes less – usually less- 5 – average or so – I would be an anomaly in CMU's – well no – I am not exposed very much to colds – but – that type of study a gremlin could influence- mom can make me feel sick – running nose burning throat-  ican tell the difference between real sick and gremlin sick when it's done – I would be very weary of a study saying sleep is required-  the unions want that study to say certain things – to justify more union jobs and not letting one person work harder with less sleep time.  - I just remembered – like in contracting – they don't necessarily want you moving fast-  if you move fast – you get told to slow down by your fellow workers to not make them work bad- though it depends on who your boss is.   Other bosses are better at fostering a less socialist work envrionment.  I remember a story about the city of Chicago. 

prew – itt -pruit

we're doing chest pangs a little left side.. 

Sen Voynavich – wanting to work in a soup kitchen and not being a spring chicken – not usually something said about a Senator because except for Barack Obama who is around my years alive on this planet it is a usually not a question – another “friend” saying “hi” - and revealing the democrats feel they control the Senate of he wouldn't announce leaving – though it was a frandstand not an action. 

I would worry about competing for high student reviews-  BUT – yes they may feel any discernable difference is a problem.  But if you could single out good from bad professors – ti could be used later to fire the bad ones-  the union of professors will read a merit pay system like that – the merit is a reason to justify your job- so who doesn't get it – is getting a message they coudl be fired or not getting merit pay could be used to justify firing – which will make the union fight it in a herd behavior thing. 

the 700lb woman in that chair – regular 4 – legged metal chair – much like the ones I break – she's double my weight at her heaviest and at least 100-200 lbs more than me – but she can sit on a chair like that and here I broke a metal chair like that – nearly 2 – in Ct I borke a chair as I recollect and in CCAC – a theater seat came out on me as I was meeting the egyptian UN ambassador.   - by the way apparently some people have a lot of get of jail free cards – who like got rid of 50 billion -  - but let's see what happens. 

the college of Inquiry- college of something – not a college a group – but called the college of debate or   or osmething like that in Chicago- it was like a debate club-  but with dinner and the people were older – Lincoln – near the brown line – several stops from belmont – you had to buy dinner to participate – and I saw a woman there who was very left at the Harold Washington Library she apparently worked there – very Democratic-  I was good at arguing and that did impress them  - but I ahd no idea about the toes I could step on – politically – that people are very emotional about losing a debate – it's like blood. 

I did have to clean the toilets unclog them at DAM – and they would break the toilets – in DAM – like when they announced the wrong thing – wrong person as manager- Ron – when they announced him in  the old office – immediately two of the toilets were not worked – 2 out of 3 for around 100 people – guess there were 4 altogether – I found a toilet my first day not working – the cord was off - - chain had been slipped off the handle inside – I fixed that – where else- in NC – took the boating course- the toilet there had issues – and the apratment in Pittsburgh on Atwood – but the first one coming back 320 Atwood not 259 – I lived at 320 in 2000 for 6 months – learning how to fix the bath and I guess the toilet – but the bathtube would clog - - locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam.  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is.

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant. 

there are no steroids in baseball or football – a player said so – the sky is red

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting .  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job..  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” . 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream.  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law.

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

60 Minutes  1/11/09
ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters. 


Oil swaps – kind of like housing swaps I bet – and enron passed these changes , you don;t say- but whatconcerns me – this could be done in other commodity markets-  if we switch to natural gas – aka T boone pickens – they could do this all over again -  the government must have known it left the commodities market unregulated – I stopped here – aka T Boone Pickens and natural gas – they could do this all – ahh – I did get off place and I coughed and passed gas as I realized it – it's odd first of all how I stop in writing just before making a point nad get distracted – high mom -  getting way off thought and into another write the point – let me make the point – it almost might be that politicians and lawmakers leave “Some goods out for theft” on purpose – yawning as I write that – like one way to find out how criminal people are is to leave them something to take – yawning again – no one could have spotted loopholes made with enron even though they made the loopholes-  like CA legislators who profitted – got into office on the power supply mess in CA – they didn't follow through and close loopholes? - that big investigation into CA not having sufficient power to meet demand causing the crazy prices – touching thumbs and coughing – and that did not get politicians in the West at least looking seriously at what laws allowed enron to do that? - Odd fairly big detail to miss for the people that would have been lobbied for the change- very short memories there.  Hmmmm  - oh well – whole lotta speculatin' goin' on – coughing here – and next is the power supply for homes – that is the next thing they want to spike.

A good segue way into the singer  in haiti – who “made something of himself”  - songs like don;t have to be a billionairre to reach the moon – it is not innovative musically – and I wouldn't expect it to be – most popular songs aren't – in addition though it hits no substance – no practical way to acheive dreams  - doesn't urge people on a course to acheive dreams – and has no other commentary to it – now that standard would kill a lot of songbirds – many pop singers can be accussed of making derivative themed songs – they sell -  but this guy is really popular and I am saying he isn't saying that much.  - getting into an infinfinite  loop and pulling out of it making me first rest my forehad on on my righx index knuckle and then rub it on it ina circular pattern – perhaps a swirl in actuality – an odd subconcious thing to do.  Passed gas right there – hi mom – but the singer has grammies and this and that suggesting certain people are on his side – I want to keep this short- what did the Nazi party offer youth when it started like – something like food, bread, education – no actual industry not under Nazi control because of course that would delude Nazi power – you get them all working for the organization – AND – the cool part- you kill off or ensure there is no industry other than yours so that everyone is desperate and the only way to succeed is to join your organization so that you have control of all the people and how much they make and what they know – but he's so generous – and it leads to the other fun question – is what is happnening in Haiti a trail run for here? - and other places – let's use Haiti as a test ground in how to found a totalitarian state – NEATO RINO  - what neat experiments people are doing right now.  Iusn't it NEAT and COOL – how to starve a nation and buy out its industries to totally control its population by Bill Gates and warren Buffet – oops I don;t see their name on the title  . . . . . .. just yet.  Can worrying about insurance induce mental illness – insurance may give you peace of mind, but the didfferent options and being so concerned about your coverage and maybe having dellusions of a talking geco – I wonder if that could cause mental illness too – I have to admit that one is a stretch – cause there is nothing corrupt about the profits of the insurance industry where coverage is andated by law in many cases.   

I hd a note – ah the newshour – the only economist who knew what was right came from San francisco – and the ecnomists were partying in San Francisco as the meltdown occurred and they said little – like the global warming crew madea  big stink – mybe osme said something – but apparently not much was said. 


I do remember – for some reason – I always thought I wasn't doing the right thing, that things weren't going right – I didn't know what was happening to me, I cn say now possibly with good reason, but I wanted to say – I remember having turned 29 and getting off the bus going to my parents home – I have to walk about a mile – down the street I grew up cross a couple streams running by the raod – but I remember thinking – dam – I'm 29, I'm not dead yet, whatever else I did wrong or whatever – I'm 29 and I'm not dead so it can't be all bad, like if I am so unsuccessful than why am I still alive.  It was odd to find joy that way, that was one of the first times, but there was joy in that thought – that maybe I hadn't screwed everything up – maybe some part of it was done right – maybe there is something to be joyful in getting older and there should be – yet Mr rooney is right that most people are angry about a life that passed thme by and at their current pains instead joyful about having gotten something out of it all.  People are more bitter than I ever dreamed and for so little reason.  I know that now – it is – but I will be 35 this time if that happens-  if not I made 34 and it is greater 29 and I do not feel the time was wasted – I can live and die with that.  You probably hear the best bedtime stories at those hours you go to sleep

The Caterwauling of a Hamster in the Wilderness
the dod site contqact form now does a catch -22 that shuts you out – it appears to work – you submit an email and a comment – to the ask a question option – but then to me a second screen comes up asking for more detailed information – name address and country  and state and email – and when I submit the email I've been using – it states it already has that email and cannot receive and it appears the comment never actually goes through – because it gets hung up on already having my email address.  20:39 Est 1/11/09

Ben Ferguson -


What is wrong with waiting a few years and keeping our oil for ourself – kind of do you think we should live at the expense of others or is it one world – for now there is not too much wrong with waiting a few years – but the strategy of using their oil so we are the onely ones left with oil – and we can live and let them die – it would be better to try to solve energy needs together – it isn't going to work to keep oil for just us and let everyone else starve- that may make sense from a direct look at self interest – that is the strategy that leads to being Israel – with the bombs and rockets from Hamaz – we can fend them off- yes and so can Israel – it can fend off the bombs-  but it just looks like joy and a half to have to live that way – so why do that – plant the potato – don't eat it – that's why – you don;t accept that – you want to eat the potato – keep our oil for us – but that will foment terrorism – best to figure out how to save everyone – nto just us- it is doable – more than likely – maybe we need to stop holding innovation back -  I could mail a certain governor more often – I usually just respond to one thing – hmm

the environmental regulations prevent us using our own oil – hmmm – interesting – who though that one up.  

small banks made the loans Ben – the home loans – I thought that was mroe a policy for the sub-prime loans only of larger banks – maybe yo uknow that. 

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging.  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Allen Hunt -


Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

“nobody is above the law” - Obama – meaning perhaps – I should not get a pass and he has a definition to prosecute 

“the one thing that stayed intact in my administration is the constitution”- president Bush – a swipe at Obama- for like not being legally qualified to be President by his citizenship and his small detail issue of overlooking his followers who have violated tons of people's rights under the constitution – but they are his boyss n girls and they appear above the law in the coming Obama administration – If there is one – Bush has 9 days to do something yet.

18:59 EST
Bob – tartansville – not muslims against jews in Israel – muslims against world -  as sec of state caller would support good and oppose evil – I don't believe in Christian or good or evil at this point – boy we would havwe short conversations.  - next

Molly – younger brother with very erradic behavior – has job but lost friendships – party for wedding anniversary – My parents never had a big wedding anniversary – I was not expectedto plan it – it never even came up – it just wasn't done – caller makes point that brother is not Christian – host asking about her though. - the guy  at CCAC gym – used to use this reference – call me younger brother as a code word – I didn't get that – host made inference to gym  later in show – I've lost friends – I have less supporters – yes and how much pressure were they under.

circa history – bat out of hell goes to heaven – kfyo – the bomber who became Christian – 18:47 EST – convertain Japanese captain to Japanese preacher eventually – that would be a way to learn about us – blind faith yes we can

I may be the immayture one here – pact to stay in touch – caller doesn't have wife and kids – sent email – if this is my kind of family – I don't want a famly like this – family memeber thinks he needs counselling – this is dirty – H storong fiath life- caller John – Clearwater  FL -

Caller Matt - collateral dmage with mother – she has arthriitis – get words of wisdom from priest – I'm catholic  - Matt  0-  I am not currently – or I do not practice as I do not believe in the bible as truth or in Jesus as divine – Jesus is not the Universe – nor is the christian god – I gave up catholicism – caller hurt mother- but she's mom – in my case she may have tried to kill several times throughout my life – but that will never been proven one way or another-

my parents weren't at 2 of or 3 of my college graduation – though i was only in part of 1 of those – and they split real fast out of my CMU graduation – never understood that – they did not want to meet anyone.  Now things make more sense – thatr professor – the one was trhere – he would not go inside- he stayed outside away from me – not totally surprising – it has more meaning now. 

18:30 EST
will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided evenly between them.   Up until just before she died.  - this is in NJ

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that. 


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down.

13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle

13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship..  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ..

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died.

r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -.  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive..   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way.. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

mailed durbin the email list 5   - 18:12 EST 1/9/09

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different.  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb. 



3 gifts for Allen Colmes – gold francansense and myrrh

As The Windfarm Blows – The PBS Soap Opera of News
So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it..  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Boortz

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

Right Thinkin' Boyz
-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

threatening email of student at a college caused feds to ask him questions references Virginia Tech shootings – kfyo news announcement -yes I have sent some interesting emails – they are not quite in the same vein – and if you want go there – they are older ones I bet – that should have been cleared up – you are trying to get me on whatever you can

oh this is the world we live in

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

my attackers aren't wearing uniforms – again for torture to be real it is not just the pain – it is the intimidation and a friendly force cannot fully simulate that – if your buddies are conducting the torture they are not going to go too far – now the military is a little vindictive as a group – still it's (not and passed gas as I noticed he missing 'not') a person that wants to kill you and hates you inflicting pain – they can't simulate that – let muslims train our soldiers by torturing them – that may be different.  It might be more effective. 


Venting My Spleen Childhood History With Sports and Women – oh I have to go to bathroom as titling this – 12:17 – title made after rightintg section below
yes I am a virgin – no sex issues – haven't looked at tons of online porn and have not engaged in actively looking at it – only really whitehouse.com – when I was looking for whitehouse.gov – but yes dcotros and propylactic comapanies and blackmailers galore and prostitution rings do not like me – a man who is 34 and has not had sex -  ARRRRRGGGHHH  - I guess that is creepy and weird to most people – not to have had sex. - Definitely events influenced that – I couldn;t even produce at a sperm bank and that was weird and i think – I siad this earlier-  someone wants to make sure I am the last of my DNA on this earth.  And that is intentional – Any contact risks that so they blocked all sexual contact -how – my parents sort of kept me away from other kids-  our house did – hard to leave – no one my age to play with – the close connections that lead to dating didn't develop and just the way my mother and father handled me – so nervous about everything – kept very nervous – making huge mistakes – never introduced to women or encouraged by father – both mother and father in many ways made me ashamed to be a man – mother kept complaining about how like she was going into medicine and father made her give up being a doctor if she wanted to marry him so she wouldn't have a higher income than he did – men did evil things – and dad screamed at me a lot and I stayed away from him – more like dealing with a monster – I grew up hating being German and hating being a guy – and no I still – Xavier has a Italian stallion thing to it – with the Italian men – which many of the students are – Italian americans – like hugging and kissing is common – even as a greeting – not like Italy – but people did touch each other more often – drama it was very noticeable – prejudice did the rest – like no one really interested – the only thing that happened – women seemed uncontrollable – a memorable negative experience was a girl I didn't know who called me like every week for 6-7 weeks or longer – it scared me – she wanted to date me and we never talked in school – like I found out what she looked like after she called – but we never talked in junior high – while the parent's laugh – it was planted – it's not natural – even if she did like me that much – to have no fear and call me several different times and I was not receptive – that is really odd – for her to have the feelings and not anything or say something once is not so odd – but it didn't go like that – she called a lot and I could never nicely – I tried and was nice-  but she kept calling – stopped eventually – but that experience at like 13 turned me off to relationship – definitely also my jewish – I will add it older female neighbor and how that ended in 7th grade – she was always manipulating me – certain things – elementary school there was a major incident with her – I don;t even remember all of it – but she wanted me to go up to teachers and ask them odd questions – there was a rational – but I remember being a little older maybe 8th grade and finding out it was total bunk – not true – but she was trying to get me to ask these odd questions – she tried and succeeded in getting to tease another boy – I had no idea I was being used – but definitely my first experiences with the opposite sex were less than perfect – steer clear at all costs – women were devious withces who used men and if you opened up lots of conversation with them negative things could happen – but there were more than that incident with that neighbor – she caused me to get blamed for a lot of stuff in the neighborhood and she started a lot of it – I was blamed because I was bigger and a boy.    And skipping up to high school and the Goodspeed Opera House – well – like the near gay sex incident would have been 6th grade or early 7th but more than likely 6th and the nI kind of broke off the friendship as it made me very uncomfortable – that failed so within a year we had thsi other girl call me up out of the blue – also I never got to be a guy – not on  a sports team – that all went wrong – never a person to look up to athletically – which I'm sure influenced not having sex and not meeting women – but naturally I am 6' 2” and that should not have been a problem – I should have been athletic and it is thoroughly possible – just didn;t get encouraged – things went a little wrong in soccer – at early age so I didn't up having good sports experiences – got hit hard by a soccer ball – like got in the way of a soccer ball kicked full force but took it in the stomach at age 9 – remember that – and father kept telling me I was awkward and this and that – forgot to mention until age 30 that in 7th grade

it's not always the right thing to find out who a person is and what he wants if you get bad vibes – it could Sauron or Satan – Mr schmuckhead from Harvard who is a lying hippocrit from what I heard yesterday and you are playing today too with that line you opened with – I have to find out – no I don;t I can figure you out from yesterday – next -

but continuing – father didn;t really mention until age – my age 30 that he played sports all through school – sort of mentioned – but it wasn't till age 30 he showed me the pictures and talked to me about it – in the “I've beaten you” conversation – it ended sounding like he was telling me he beat me in life – and this would be christmas of 2004.  - during my youth he was very silent on sports and on girls – occassionally telling me I was doing it wrong – but not very isntructive on how to do it better – in fact he rarely showed me how to do anything the correct way before letting me screw up – and if he did – it was as a ploy – correct way to shovel snow- correct way to stack wood – and then you get yelled at if you don't do it that way- and if you do that right – he finds something else to yell at – but the right way to go about a career or girls or sports which he knew – he was very silent  - let me make tons of mistakes and never helped me avoid a few.  I probably wouldn't have been very comfortable with other kids in psorts and that was showing up a little – I remember a pizza party around 6th grade and being shocked at this guy making this huge mess in this restaurant throwing spitballs and stuff in a restaurant – but around there was the last time I played soccer – and it was odd those last seasons – I was on a team that was overmatched – and that not a good thing – not only better players – they were trained differently – we didn't go to the same league – we played outdoors as kids from same area – oh there is the jet plane that is military 9:46 – screw you – we played outdoors and the teams were organized by town – two towns in the soccer league – that shouldn;t have been a problem – BUT – the last year like we had a match first with this indoor team from this sports arena – a sports club – they may have been our age or a year or two older – but they were much better trained and we didn't stand a chance – and in addition we played some teams out of doors that were – I remember being a foot shorter – they were 1 or 2 or more years older so like 12 year olds playing 14 or 15  year olds – it was very intimidating and not a lot of fun – and form their voice change – from their voice – they had gone through puberty – we had not for the most part – along with the growth spurt – and yes – the reason in part I gave up playing was that memory of being creamed that last year – by kids who seemed older or better trained and like their height had 6” as a group per capita on our height – and it was revenge – there were two town – it is sports it is competitive-  my town was smaller – the other town had higher status in the CT pecking order – my team won the year before – it was supposed to – we beat all the team from my town and from the other one – but the other town held majority stake in the league – so next year they divided the players differently – they mixed players from my town and the other town and broke up the strongest players – it was very childish – we didn't dominate all the other teams – we in fact were underdogs into the final game – but the other team was from the larger town and they were supposed to beat us and they didn;t – their thought was to get back at the only small team who beat them – the last game was not a playoff- we had lost – but because we were the only team to beat them all season – they wanted one more match against us to prove superiority – but they lost it instead of winning it – which is why the next year – the team from my town and there were two as I recollect -but ours was borken and it looked like those in control made sure we would never win  and in addition the new thing of playing players who had much different training or a different age – none of which should have happened – but it did – and is an insight into sports- I would encounter the other town next to mine – in high school – in an invention context – my math teacher who I had the most dealings with lived in that town – and in inventing and in soccer they were “highly competitive” - but in both the parents “enusred” their children won – in the inventing competition – they almost cheated – not called on it – but they borught in engineers to help the high school students – local parents – BUT – other teams didn't do that and while the judges said best presentation – and in the end on what was in front of the judges that was fair – it was clear – they had more money than say other teams – one from Bridgeport for example – who did a very good job – but didn't have an actually person in a wheelchair to use the device or a fully made set – which this team did – but that is money – and the real difference in quality in presentation was the money – and it's not really a good way to win an invention competition is to have the better set.   - that was a high school experience too – CT was competitive I guess – I didn;t see as much of that being in a smaller town – butt he Trumbull isn;t world series junior baseball champs – it is there – and I hated that part of the state – I am more east CT than the monied shore and south west CT where like David Letterman and other various scumbags live.  It does not have the same feel. 
But the other bad experience with women was in the Goodspeed Opera House – I again felt very negative about what I saw – I descirbed this before – and to clarify – it was the House manager who told me – she didn't want to see me again – getting ahead – my mother had me go down and ask about auditions at the Goodspeed – I guess at age 16 – but  I didn't want to do it – I started acting because of my German friend who invited to his play – so I started acting – otherwise I would have done nothing in high school – things went sour with tennis team – had to win a match to get into it – when I was better and I couldn't win it – and the year beofre I just good enough and they cut me then too – swimming conflicted with drama – myt father did push me to take a sport in his angry yelling voice saying that most guys take sports – saying that to me  – yet I wasn't really prepared to succeed in a sport – not doing one in junior high becuase of experiences at age 12 – and why didn;t he say something there – he shut his mouth for those crucial when at his age he played sports – but then chastised me at age 15 that I needed a sport in high school – so I felt a fialure for not ever getting on a sports team – I didn;t really want to play – wa heavy in junior high – lighter in high school – but not athletic fresman year – I could have been – I have the body  - but like many of the kids hated me in junior high and I wanted to be away from people – and I kind of needed to feel comfortable the first year in high school – it was going to a larger place – I knew none of the kids – like a kid from Middletown – the place where the high school is based – had a different experience there -

there was an odd thing were there was a mischedule for a soccer game – they told the teams to meet at different fields – one team was told one field and the team another field – in the suburbs these are miles apart – but both teams expected the other team to be at their field – we were early to practice – and we didn't find any of the players my team on the field that was on the paper- so we went around to the other fields and found the other team – who was there-  it was odd because I was the only player who did that-  everyone else on my team practiced on the field assigned on the paper – but I wound up practicing with the other team – and no one thought to like you know – pick a field and just have the game a little later – why that is important – is that team got to meet me AND THE PARENTS OR WHOMEVER GOT TO SEE ME WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWN TO BE AROUND ME AROUND – mother was in control of when we left and such – so it does smell – it singled me out versus others – like things like that- to introduce me to others – there were several things like that – but that is one that comes up.  It just a mistype on a page that caused that and mother's habbit of being very early – and no one from my team being on my field to make us worry it was the wrong field – though mother could have chosen to stay and wait which most adults do – knowing a few minutes can make adifference better than a nervous 12 year old does-  she said nothing and went to check the other fields.  

I got off thinking about acting – which was introduced – cause it raises a new point- if I didn't get into acting – I would have gotten on the swim team – the reason I couldn't get on the swim team was that it conflicted with acting – and it was my German friend who – his family that started me acting – like if my friends in 7th grade were spiked and I could see the negative connotations – and I see the issues in elementary with him – and oddly our friendship broke off in 7th – actually more than one negative experience in 6th grade-  like past the guy down the street who moved away – there was not one positive experience so by 4th grade it was controlled – everyone I ran into seems to go one way -  the German and the Greek are the two they missed – with acting – did they miss them- acting made me wind up not playing a sport – I would have had a very different acceptance level if I had just tried a sport.  And acting happened a year before I thought of trying out for swimming – so it nicely blocked that-   - for one sec let me go back  6th grade polish – some cards of mine were missing – we collected cards – garbage pail kids-  mother threw them all away or I traded a few on ebay -to a military dentist nonetheless – but it wouldn't matter for this – I had a stack of cards I think in my mother's bedroom for some reason – this “friend” of mine who was polish – and it was odd because he lived in a different part of town several miles away – and we didn;t share too common interests and it was odd we ever got to be friends – in addition – the following – he was the only person in this room where I kept these cards and wehn I checked after he left my house – a few were missing a few were out of order – I thought he'd stolen – them  - I accused him of that – his mother didn't let me see him – I wound up having to apologize to him for accusing him – I wanted to see him – I felt guilty about accusing over the next year – I eventually called- mother stayed very neutral and said little – and I was in trouble with him – he wanted to see R rated  movies which his parents forbade and my parents did not – and I got into trouble for trying to show him one – which was around and mother was there – but father got angry anyway – there was an odd scene – yes let me explain – the “friend” wanted to see an R -rated movie – we would have been 11 or 12 – my parents allowed it – his did not – my mother did ask for permission – and got it from his mother – so we started to watch it – my father came up and was the one who stopped the tape and yelled at me – saying I hsouldn;t have pushed mother and shouldn't asked and gotten her to say yes – the “Weakling” mother was at saying yes to me -  WHICH IS TOTAL BULLSHIT BUT WAS NICELY SET UP BY THIS POLISH WOMAN HER SON AND MY PARENTS !!!!! AND AT LEAST 3 OF THE 4 ARE GUILTY I BET -  because it was my fault for badgering and getting approval and then turning on a movie we had gotten approval to see and he was pushing – my “friend” was pushing me to see the movie and I felt bad because my parents let me see it and his didn't and let me see R rated movies and look at playboy and he wanted to do that a lot more than I did and kept pushing on me to let him see that so yes I asked my parents – and I aksed mom over dad becuase mom seemed the more likely to say yes person – but yes in the scenario dad winds up haivng the tape stooped and never letting my “freidn” watching saying it is too much and even though his mother did okay it – father did not want to be responsible-   AND LOOKING AT IT ALL AND KNOWING WHO THE ACTORS WERE – IT IS TOTAL BULLSHIT I WAS BEING FED AND USED BY ALL OF THEM  - I was yelled one for badgering mother to say yes – and two for shwoing my firned the playboys upstairs that father got – even though mother knew-  it was my fault - - and our “freindship” ended with the theft – as I was getting to – I had a particualr stack of cards in I think my mother's bedroom – but away from us – coughing here – and when he left – we were the only people in the house – I had gone through the stack before he came over – and when he left some cards were out of order -garbage pial kid cards have numbers and I kept them in order and some were missing – and we stopped seeing each other for a year – and I choose to call in about year maybe 3 months-  but time passed and – we had one visit after that one – where I said there are cards missing and it was you, mother, and I in the house – I didn't take my own cards – and why would mom rifle thhrough them? - and she wouldn't take any? - and so said let's not go upstairs anymore – and that was the last visit – but time passed he never called again – we didn't see each other for a while I think a year – but not necessarily – but I had to call – and his mother said that he felt very guilty and wanted to give back everything to me – and really dug in – and I had to apologize to him – for accusing him – the thing is I never found the card and it never turned up – so it is likely he stole it – and he didn't want a long apology – he cut me off as I was apologizing – seemingly not wanting to make me feel too bad.  -  In addition around the time he started to talke to me in 4th grade – two other people and one them was polish – talked to me – a little bit – and one of them was also polish – and his mother was like my mother's campaign manager when she ran  for state Representative – but to get the Republican nomination – so polish had some issues to and they do trace – that's the problem – there were a few in high school too  - were there any other bad experiences with the other two – contact with both of them was briefer – one of them played a computer game with me – bard's tale – but there isn't a negative experience – he would have been able to track – I am exhausted and nearly forgot about –

we don't want me to talk about attempted rape at Goodspeed Opera House – do we michael price – cause I ahve gone off on all other siode issues and not gottne back to the that and I am tired – but I will finish out – and get there – which is the last very negative experience with women – before college -

but this got expanded to sports – that is a productive discussion - - I was tracing friends to show that from elementary school or primary school higher years – my “friends” seemed to be spiked with people who gave me negative experiences and yes in many cases certai nethnicisties or religion pop up – yes religions in middle school – it's there – besides the teacher – a student  - indirectly – but it's there -
but I was trying to figure out – greek and german - 6th grade till 8th grade two boys I knew – I have always thought acting was a very good thing for me – singing in particular – but my German friend has ties ot Cornell – which also said no on one of the two days Yale said no – Dimitri's father had cancer – for a while – and he went abroad – became a teacher – mohter showed me his picture in the paper for marriage – acting made me seem like a fairy – gay – and if I didn;t act – I might have played a sport – it's very hard – but yes the only group they missed was the greek and the german – odd of them to miss a group – and the greek has the wrong signs – cancer pictures, a business, studied aborad, and he gets paper coverage – I did accidentally in 7th grade- but never for an accomplishment – the wife of the germans she had some ties with teaching – like mother- actually the wife substituted a teacher for my biology class.  - Dimitri moved in – in 6th grade – even close by – very convenient timing- why -intellectually I was pretty strong – I said with the other guy – it was odd we were friends – because I was more of an intellectual – the greek and the german were more my speed  - they were tracked higher than I was at RHAM – not in their classes until 8th grade and then math only – and I ahd bad experience and that seems planned and I commented on that – but it was painful because the people you were tracked with were supposed to be your “friends” - they weren't in my case – and some trips or things – there was an experience- where – in a place you had to decide what activity you wanted to be in – and I wanted to ask them and I couldn't and the homeroom teacher – said well you friend is right next to you – and I answered – no he's not – I want ask those two  who are in the higher level – homeroom – homeroom was done by track in junior high or maybe by last name – no by track  because A and S were the last names – and I remember feeling bad – and it felt bad – I was friends with them – but in a lower track and told by the public school system I was stupider – there weren't any bad inciedents – directly – the greek was kind of snobbish – and trying to one upsman you – but it didn;t work and there isn't a mark – that I recollect – I have been thinking for a while 11:17 – it is hard – but they would have been the only friends that weren't spiked – and the greek introduced me to the german arriving 6th grade – the german was in another and had no good reason to meet me otherwise – we others pushed my parents into sending me to Xavier – the germans pushed me into drama – with their Cornell and teaching connections – passing gas – drama – so I had to go to voice and dance lessons – all of which mother okayed – actually significant money on dance lessons – which is notable – because little money spent on anything else – no money on sports – it starts to look odd that no money was spent on me for anything – so they invented something – if I hadn't had a negative in soccer – I oculd have played that in high school – which oddly did not conflict with drama – but there was a negative experience with soccer – so I wouldn't play that – leaving swimming and running and tennis – mor than likely – swimming and running – swimming I know coincided with drama – if running didn't – I was always slow – being well-framed – not just fat – but like a football player – running speed is not what I would have – swimming having been certified a lifeguard made more sense – they needed to block that – and yes they could have had the forethought to introduce me to drama in summer of 8th grade or in 9th grade so that I would be in drama in 10th so that when I start looking around saying – hey I am going to go through place never having been on a sports team  -the only logical one is  swimming  - and it conflicts with drama so that by getting me into drama I don;t end up having a sport in high school – and that oculd have been thought out – it does fit all the pattern – the friends are actually negative – which forms a perfect trend -elementary, junior high, and high school – and drama does some key things that some would want – and this I guess is what I was supposed to write up  - I was writing this part last night – in long hand – like getting me to buy metal figures which wound up being useless in 7th and 8th grade another group of kids at that time – talked of them before – and ti connects – I said it all previous ly – one of them was jewish – but I looked at it – and like we played that game one time – and I spent loads of money on those figures after that and never played that game – chainmail – ever again – and they stopped after junior high – but it lifted tons of money off of me and returned little value – it was fun to have al lthe figures – which mother kept – she threw the cards away but kept the figures – threw out the castle parts but kept the metallic figures – kind of odd – could have kept both – took the heavier metal figures down here to NC – BECAUSE TI WAS A VICTORY -  in money nad time I spun my wheels and did not notice time going by – that was the objective – drama acheived the same end – while speaking is a nice skill – I had it as a sophomore – 2 more years of drama did not improve that-  I got not so great parts – the money and energy wated on voice and tap and ballroom – nice to know – but I ahve to admit – I used those skills very infreguently – that same time might have well been spent on science – I loved to brew potions as a kid – in elementary school – mother never transfered that to chemistry a degree she has – we talked of this – my mind went blank – mother moved downstairs – mother admitted to not buying me a chemistry set – which I recently bought – somethig was lipped I think out of my mind – but my main is more important which was – the time spent playing with figures and building castles had some value -but was not too much use – where as time with chemistry – I was good in biology – I could have spent time exploring that – but a person with a phd in freshwater ecology and her bachellors in chemistry – no chemistry set – no projects collecting animals and naming them – mother encouraged very little – dad discouraged me from engineering – which is he was – and not the castles – the castles and figures were 7th and 8th grade – but drama was high school and while I was good at it – what I meant to say above is it took up time that could have been spent learning chemistry or biology or playing with stuff more along those lines – but drama took up the time and knowing how to tap dance is of little use now – and I no longer think that that was unintentional – who controls drama? - in addition – a person i had limited contact with in high school who was mostly in a different track – but out of the blue BECAUSE I WAS IN DRAMA – decides to call me up and offer me a job at the Goodspeed Opera House-  mother did have me go down there for an audition – she woudl do things like that- but mom I have to be an equity actor even to audition – but she pushed me to go down there anyway – and I did becuase of her and they turned me away – she tried to do that with the casino – why don;t you go to New London and work on the casion – mom – I;m not a full architect and ask to do what? - see you're not taking advantage of your opportunities-  what opportunities – they are not asking to hire and besides – that's an hour dirve – it's like Pittsburgh- nad hse moved downstairs as I wrote that – but it's like Pittsburgh – a job is offered but it's too far away so you don;t take it and it's your fault – not a group fixing things so they fall through – mom was similar – seeting me up with projects that didn't make sense and then it's your fault for not taking advantage – yes the casino was large – but it was far away – and yes – here is what I'm getting to here – AFTER showing up at the Goodspeed to try to get an audition and the person who handled the call was the company manager at the time who later became the House Manager who fired me – after that is when my classmate reveals he knows Michael Price – and they need ushers – would you like the job – and i course say yes seems neat- the magic of theater – this is what I was writing about last night – BUT – what jobs did I miss - - they coopted – I was in a serville position -taking tickets – serving coffee and drinks – I liked my theater experience – but I never questioned what else I could be doing - - the usher job was 2 cents above minimum wage – I was turned down as a lifeguard at my beach in my town – others were accepted – we all attended the same class – that is a much more responsible and authoritative(couldn't remember how to spell authorative – sorry authoritative- slowed me down so someone can edit what I say next)  position, it also would make you want to be more fit – in the goodspeed I saw an actress and dancer get hurt which took the sails out of me wanting to be an actor – becuase she broke her leg and was out the rest of the time – and I realized that acting was very ephemeral and in that way not the best thing to go into – and that happened as a senior after 3 years of energy – it looks like I twirled about and spent 3 years in acting and drama and then got out of it – when perhaps it was much better managed than that – got me through high school not doing too much to give me a leg up on a career – actors are gay and fairers – by my size and build – if I did any sports – no one would peg me as gay – but by being an actor – everyone thinks I'm gay and that is used now – and there are no sports on the resume – and if the german friend didn;t introduce drama – there probably would have been something.   But we got to the Goodspeed – I get fired in time – but am there for senior year – I got off this, but with  the lifeguard – I didn;t know it – but I was good with money- just had no experience – IF  I DIDN;T GO TO THE GOODSPEED WHICH WAS A JOB MY “FRIEND” GOT ME  - I would have looked for something else-  I worked as a grocery bagger before – but not as cashier- would have gotten retail experience – learned about theft and being lied to – the people in the Goodspeed were wealthy and better liars – didn't catch them – never leanred – and never saw a real business – never established a history with a company – the theater is odd on a resume – in addition got fired – I charged Michael Price for coffee which put me off balance – because he always tells you who he is later- that made me feel awkward – IF HE WATNED HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT -  I got more and not less nervous around the actors as I stayed there longer-  which was odd and would have become more apparent if I stayed longer – then there was the rape – and some idiot is going to say some thing about an attempted rape should have been reported – ho ho ho – how aobut hypothetical attmepted rape – I explained how the person who did it could have filed a lawsuit against Mcdonald's for a fire that happened there to him a few weeks before the rape – but once the charge came out and he got fired – he could no longer afford to file charges against McDonald's as he needed the job – odd that.   But what stuck in my mind as far as girls are concerned – was the young woman – who as I have said on numerous occassions may have set it up – she was where she was not officially invited – the ushers did not get invitations to parties – for cast and staff – she got herself in – in conversations amongst ourselves – the ushers it comes out that she does butter him up becuase then he will give prime work – better assignment even as another female usher is telling her – tell him no – tell him not to be friendly-  she is admitting she doesn't do that-  the boss is known to be a laides man – or like women – but again has no issues with other women who tell him no -  and I explained before – he worked with a female assitant manager – and there may have been no problems – she worked closer with him and there was no reported incident – but yes – I definitely – first of all I found out – I wasn;t at the party – I wonder if every usher found out – I doubt it – most of us disappeared – in my case forcefully – she did tell us – a few of us – but it was word of mouth – I did get a words directly from her-  confirming that my “friends” who wokred there were not telling me a complete yarn – lying – she confirmed it – but the incident is our boss reaching for this person and trying to drag her into a car – which became a case of rape – car at a party – not very bright – almost oddly not bright – he was a little drunk – gremlin – in addition I was scared of women after this – that evne getting near them might be cause for them to accuse me of rape – and it scared me the most – both of them in my mind have guilt – I don;t know how far it got – it sounds like they were still in clothing – they both have a little guilt – she got off scottt free – even the victim and no – why the fudge were you there – she wasn;t invited or normally wouldn't have been – he got fired – lost his wife – none of this ever got public – yes the goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam CT – hi there – was my firing expensive?  - but I was always very scared of women because of that incident – they are believe if you get in contact – they are right and if it is he said she said – the women wins that one – sort of the case between mother and I – I am less scared now and know with luck what to watch – but yes that incident and the way it was handled-  Mcdonald's won and avoided a nasty lawsuit for burining that guy – I rmemeber names – at least parts of them – but we don't need that – he was burned in a greesefire in a faulty piece of equipment by McDonald's, he was going to sue – he was a manager at McDonalds.   And suddnely needed the job and couldn't sue – very convenient.   And yes a female house manager came in – the assistant left- she was the first person in the Goodspeed to take a call from me as a sophomore – and in college – she felt uncomfortable around me – I came back the freshman summer to work there – I was fired in a couple weeks – I worked for her a little senior summer before going to CMU – when the change occurred but not too much – I came back in freshman summer – and she felt uncomfortable around me and wouldn;t put me on the schedule – stopped giving me hours – the explanation almost didn't occur – I wouldn't even have known – I didn;t like it that couldn't do math and adjust things that the old boss-  all his problems he could add and subtract which kind of was a needed job skill for payroll and accounting of sales – there are a few – not the main thing tickets, but still.   I never got a reprimand or whatever – been there a full year – plus – just decided not to put on the schedule – on a fluke it smeed another girl who was an usher called me up and gave me a small shift to come in – and I came in and found my name had been whited out and the manager said - “I thought I made it clear to you I was uncomfortable around you” - and that was my explanation for dismissal – my first firing almost as classy as my second one.   One class act to follow another.  I was happy with some changes – different name tage that looked cheaper than the older ones, changes in prices to make it easier to count but more expensive in general – and to cover nto bieng able to do math we were charging customers more.   And I didn't like a lot of new people coming in who seemed a lot less worldly than the leaving ones.  The new ushers- I did my job – it didn't matter.   Just didn;t give me hours and when I show up – you don't work here – bye.    An yes that left a mark and I did bump into Mr Price from time to time – the head of it all – who my high school “friend” just happened to know – ho ho ho.   But it was my fault I got fired – oh and now the computer has slwoed down – so let's take off the modem and restart the computer. 
So the goodspeed net ended up being a negative experience – and yes someone who worked at the goodspeed was in my recitation for psychology class 3rd year in CMU – a girl – and that is odd – there are not tons of CT people at CMU with Yale being so much closer.  She new the House manager who fired me.  Ah my computer sped up with the modem off – it's odd hwo that hapens. 
But that experience of watching how just a hand on a woman can result in you getting fired – I didn't want to go near women – and that was a poignant experience.

yes the city of Pittsburgh is sore with a CMU professor or grad student who did a probably sincere and honest study suggesting the city had too many firemen for its size – WHICH IS PROBABLY TRUE – but with the  budget deficit in Pittsburgh – a study suggesting too many firepeople aka firemean was not what the City of Pittsburgh wanted becuase the firefighters watned to keep the jobs and were primary supporters of the mayor- so yes Pittsburgh does not always like CMU. 

3 times as likely to get sick - so out of hundred does like mean you got 3 cases instead of one or 99 cases instead of 33? - one result is more credible than the other - you size of sample could be big to meet the recognized scientific study requirements - but the amount of people who were actually sick could be small - they don't say that on kfyo news - CMU - but yes I get it so you are safe - good - you can tell Pittsburgh you are trying to get me to keep them off your back- they were on your back a little before I became a big issue - which is why there is CMU san Frnacisco CMU oman isn't it?

I do get offended the ay if a West Texan is not the speaker you feel you are doomed – you realize that is the Pittsburgh thing – like in Pittsburgh they won't combine the 400 municipalities in Allegheny so that everyone can have THEIR GUY as their elected official – BUT becasue of that attitude there is not uniformity in city services all fire departments and polciee departments and sewers and power are done differently – police do not have jurisdiction outside of a small area – could you elect an official with a good value – versus someone who “represents you” - I get very tired of that – we want our guy – yeah well we want our guy – when you get to the presidential level – that gets particularly troublesome to have that type of attitude – it's the wrong way to look at governing – good decision over your guy should take precedence – but it doesn't.       I'LL MAIL HIM ALRIGHT

I was overworried about emailing a certain not so high on the totem pole – in the can't think of the museum name – okay hold it – I'm to write this and the email queue is building – you're getting me off trying to remember I guess because someone is playing with that and I won't remember thename of museum complex – so don't qwant to dwell – I guess that is smart – I wanted to tag this with some clandestine nature – but the Lamplight district yes -that is acceptable – that's not quite right but it is good enough – I wanted to make – watching other congressmen suddenly “cut back” what they accept in email – length – which is another way of making sure they don't get meail on issues they don;t want – if you limit to 10,000 characters – you will get issues and not what I write – so I wanted to check that someone wanted this and I wasn't pushing – cause others who used to want it – are sending signals – occassionally – but you are scary and I don't want all of it – is CMU a traitor – I wouldn't put it past them – they can get email and then hand it to Obama and Nancy Pelosi – I wouldn't put it past my alma mater to sell me out – they have many people on the other side there.   How many is the question and where do their loyalties lie -should I dump them like I did Pitt.  Alright no

Military or DoD Website Wants to Play Games – Fine
the dod still goes to account creation – I submit a comment on the first screen – then it goes to account creation – I put in the same email address and it tells me there is already an account and I guess the message is rejected – it is circular and a catch -22- have to create an account but it has the email address already so it rejects the email and won't create the account or accept the message  -  I could be smart and use different address – fudge that- with them – if they're gonna make it tough to talk to the military – I am not going to submit multiple addresses and play games – after the survey – if they want their site to work it will work – there was a military.com banner ad – which is why I went – but their contact site is not working right – and I can;t take a chance with them – if I submit many multiple email addresses to get through will that tag me as a terrorist – I may evenutally try that-  - but they aren't friends these days and I sure they will hear this-  they can fix their site to work right-  they owe me a big apology and i face jerkrface Backy trying and all other morons who will be in power trying to entrap me in a crime for years now – I am not going to walk into it if I can -   - in addition I just tried with arborantractusebay@yahoo.com  and I got a CGI error anyway – but I was right – without finishing the account creation they do not get the message-  but even pushing past that they gave a CGI error – so US military is being highly dishonest and non-credible with me – which is how they feel like playing with me – very well – I get the feeling they will be eating every action they have done to me in the future and I will not give them the other addresses they are fishing for – I know what they want me to submit – they don't have an official document by me of the messages not submitted by new email addresses – in fact I should potentially switch off this one – medicated12manytimes – becuase the military has a record of it – and can tie me to it officially – versus the other addresses there was no account created in the dod – some of them – that period where I had to switch mailing address every day – oh it doens't really matter I'm not really guilty of anything and they are guilty of a bunch if they try it's a farce anyway.  But they don't want contact and every level of now 3 levels to get throuhg screwed up in some way – or the last 2 levels screwed up and yesterday the first two screwed up.  And they do better than that when they want to.

Sen George W Bush of TX taking Senator Hutchison's seat?  - no – sorry – yes the different shades of stone in the washington monument could possibly make someone as green as an Irishman, but they were known to hunt leprechuans – the Irishmen who had to be very clever to escape capture – I guess magic aided the leprechuans when needed – I see – wanted to say something else and I just forgot it – ah yes as an end – Never hold a competition for an architectural design – that's (like) rule #1 or more a committee of decision in architecture invariable leads to a garish mess being and this story is no different – “I am Ramses II fear me” - Percy Shelley – isn't (it) Tai-wan who now has the tallest building? - he could try my case and slap their wrists and prevent further prosecution via double jeopardy – but you're right that want me not to exist – but I do – cool I get to really be Nelson Mandella – NEATO – God does have a sense of humor as is evinced by the two different stone colors of the washington monument.  -uggghh – can't we not have a civil war to make 'em see they're being bean heads and like part of the world may suffer because of it? - I wish -

li-ber-al – it's “cute” - it may not be accurate – you're assuming too much – best to hang a man with own words – than put the words in his mouth that you want him to say – like hannity that resembles what the Democrats did with Bush – and I thought that was stupid – you've gotta know that. 

there is a difference between knowing the mind of God and kind of getting told – in time I want you here – getting more a message – several messages – from whomever they are from – but getting told nonetheless – you're not going to wind up where you thought you were – that is different from claiming to be able to know another's thoughts – but apparently that is possible too – the perfect small bit a rain – enough to harden the sand – not enough to damage the package-  was most appreciated a few days ago.  - mother is saying hello all of sudden 6:43 EST 1/13/09

wwww.foxnews.com got into history after one use – as it was part of the history ASSuMEd it was part of the right address – and yes the wrong addresses get added – I USUALLY remember to delete a wrong address and oddly didn't see it come up or forgot in this case.   Odd that.  Yes they can help that.    And the wrong addrees error help them track the computer 1/13/09 5:58 EST - - mistype of – wwwhitehouse.gov also came up in the history – apparently a lot of bad history.   Again didn't notice missing  period looking right at it.  1/13/09 – fox commercials are crashing – loading and then stopping – like youtube – and they are silent – so I will have to reboot to hear sounnd. 6:12 EST 1/13/09 – still having that to me odd behavior where if I turn off the computer and the modem and then turn on the computer first and turn on the modem later – it doesn't connect to the internet – I have to have the modem on before I turn on the computer – so it can watch my system boot up – that was not always so – that is a new thing.   I ahve to hope that is a security feature and not a virus someone put on the computer.


How Does One Trace What Is On One's Computer
So you can find this out – but can you find out the cards drawn in the tarot reading I paid for in 2001 I guess from that magic store below marine officer's recurting center in Oakland – seeing as they didn't support the war.  And they drew the hanged man – the reader even turned it the rhe right way and not upside down – to try to make a better reading – but they were in on it too -  there was also in 1995 my first bus trip to cleveland a gypsy, fortune teller in Cleveland trying to figure out why I got thrown out of school which I did and what that was supposed to mean.  - he tried to direct me towards a resume in stead of a business the reader did – they didn't wnat me to try the business.   It's all a game. 

to even know that I had downloaded beyond from an abandonware site and I don't even know precisely when but yes it was my birthday and I know which two years – but I was alone in my own room at my own computer – which may assure my guilt – but as I never talked about it with anyone there is only one way you could know what was on my computer during my birthday which if you were watching the screen and pr 2005 – you were watching the screen of my computer – which I know or suspected that was going on – but you can't even use that in court because only with a warrant could the government do that legally and it means . . .  .. - maybe it was to log and categorize everything I did on my computer from afar – it also shouldn't have been happening andthe fact that you were going there becomes to me and maybe to others the more interesting question is that people know what I was doing privately on my computer because I never talked to anyone about game playing or anythng in Pitt – there isn't a conversation about what I did at home with anyone – now perhaps you oddly got lucky and checked with the people that ran websites and maybe maybe someone could like go to my ISP and find out what sites I visited – maybe – that would be pretty thorough and I am “surprised” they would want to share precise information like that the ISP wouldn't necessarily know exactly what I was downloading or I would find it interesting if they kept records beyond what site I visted and the download shouldn't be all that chatty – but yes I suppose with very good connections you could have found out that without spying on the computer itself – realistically without a sniffer program isn't it you wouldn't have a chance in hell of finding that – still you would have to dig through the ISP to find out what I was viewing online and like I would think that shouldn't be public information – but interesting to note that nothing is private – today neither what I write longhand, what I type or what I think is private so it is an interesting world we live in.   And definitely I get that everyone knows all computer activity – but yes I am surprised that you could even find out how I celebrated I guess my 29th birthday in private-  as I thought I was alone at the time.  I doubt the ISP keeps a copy of what is downloaded though they would know you were downloading something and you could trace it to a company or the other website provider and find out.

I don't  why he does this Bush -yes Mr President the Economy is improving - No Mr Presidnet it may not be due tothe stimulus bailout - well it was the bailout bill - but it looked like DC handed the banks a check and give them a bigger check each than the citizens - and you did not trace the improvement to the checks-  they may both be conicdental evetns to an actual cause - it sort of goes along with your Katrina statement-  why are you becoming Obama in your last days - and circumlocuating - circumlocution is the word- I wanted a different tense that someone forgot to invent - but yes yes President is getting infected with meanie greenie logic where 1+1=3  - and we don;t need that -

Sleep leads to less sickness - tilted square people - CMU
did you screen candidates for having the virus previously used to test if people got sick CMU? -
zzzzzzz you were just trying to justify not sleeping in class.  - despite little sleep and urinary issues at times and around 5 -7 hours of sleep sometimes less – usually less- 5 – average or so – I would be an anomaly in CMU's – well no – I am not exposed very much to colds – but – that type of study a gremlin could influence- mom can make me feel sick – running nose burning throat-  ican tell the difference between real sick and gremlin sick when it's done – I would be very weary of a study saying sleep is required-  the unions want that study to say certain things – to justify more union jobs and not letting one person work harder with less sleep time.  - I just remembered – like in contracting – they don't necessarily want you moving fast-  if you move fast – you get told to slow down by your fellow workers to not make them work bad- though it depends on who your boss is.   Other bosses are better at fostering a less socialist work envrionment.  I remember a story about the city of Chicago. 

prew – itt -pruit

we're doing chest pangs a little left side. 

Sen Voynavich – wanting to work in a soup kitchen and not being a spring chicken – not usually something said about a Senator because except for Barack Obama who is around my years alive on this planet it is a usually not a question – another “friend” saying “hi” - and revealing the democrats feel they control the Senate of he wouldn't announce leaving – though it was a frandstand not an action. 

I would worry about competing for high student reviews-  BUT – yes they may feel any discernable difference is a problem.  But if you could single out good from bad professors – ti could be used later to fire the bad ones-  the union of professors will read a merit pay system like that – the merit is a reason to justify your job- so who doesn't get it – is getting a message they coudl be fired or not getting merit pay could be used to justify firing – which will make the union fight it in a herd behavior thing. 

the 700lb woman in that chair – regular 4 – legged metal chair – much like the ones I break – she's double my weight at her heaviest and at least 100-200 lbs more than me – but she can sit on a chair like that and here I broke a metal chair like that – nearly 2 – in Ct I borke a chair as I recollect and in CCAC – a theater seat came out on me as I was meeting the egyptian UN ambassador.   - by the way apparently some people have a lot of get of jail free cards – who like got rid of 50 billion -  - but let's see what happens. 

the college of Inquiry- college of something – not a college a group – but called the college of debate or   or osmething like that in Chicago- it was like a debate club-  but with dinner and the people were older – Lincoln – near the brown line – several stops from belmont – you had to buy dinner to participate – and I saw a woman there who was very left at the Harold Washington Library she apparently worked there – very Democratic-  I was good at arguing and that did impress them  - but I ahd no idea about the toes I could step on – politically – that people are very emotional about losing a debate – it's like blood. 

I did have to clean the toilets unclog them at DAM – and they would break the toilets – in DAM – like when they announced the wrong thing – wrong person as manager- Ron – when they announced him in  the old office – immediately two of the toilets were not worked – 2 out of 3 for around 100 people – guess there were 4 altogether – I found a toilet my first day not working – the cord was off - - chain had been slipped off the handle inside – I fixed that – where else- in NC – took the boating course- the toilet there had issues – and the apratment in Pittsburgh on Atwood – but the first one coming back 320 Atwood not 259 – I lived at 320 in 2000 for 6 months – learning how to fix the bath and I guess the toilet – but the bathtube would clog - - locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam..  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is.

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant.

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting .  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” .. 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom.. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

Jason Lewis for Rush Limbaugh 12:33 Est – 1/13/09


12:50 EST San Francisco – caller pushing audience to be mad at Republicans for bending over and going along – encouraging revolt – but an unplanned- worst possible strategy for GOP.   Clear distincition between Rep and Dems – issue good government is a blur between Republicans and Democrats – though not having communists in a capitlaist system or controlling it – is a plus. 

it is not people with money who create jobs – it is people with ideas – I disagree with normal host and Jason – they -  iforgot what goes here - - but I wanted to say – there may be – think I used they as the wrong word-  there may be more jobs destroyed  by the practices of some rich people then the jobs created by rich people-  ideas and opening up new sutff to get done – that generates jobs and rich people do not have a monopoly on that- many times rich people steal ideas from poor people and the poor inventor does not get the credit.   The rich are doing this whole redistribute wealth thing which will retard job creation faster than anything else I can think of -  12:44 Est. 

$400 dollar deducations to stimulate car buying – caller liked caller in Oaklahoma – ugggg – same old same old – dirty – can't have birthday party – I may not see my 35th birthdeay -



*
Crane collapse in Lubbock – a lot of those occur in NYC – that is usually God – in NYUC it appeared to be – Lubbock TX has become a battleground because of me it would seem and they stance people have taken – it is intersting to watch the pattern – there is little I should do to help  - others will see to things if need be – but it is interesting that it is this fulll court press on all fronts – the US is at war for all intensive purposes.  Just an invisible war.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

--
Jason Lewis

Rich and uber rich – caller my parents combined make $100,000 – I have around a 3.7 0 close to my stats – at the time of CCAC – why should people with lower grades get scholarships – and a slap at me for taking a scholarhip away from a “more deserving person” - because I took all the good scholarships away from poor people – and I know CCAc and Pittsburgh didn' think I should get a scholarship and made sure I missed dates or didn;t a key thing so I wouldn't qualify – have to go in as full time student to be considered – maybe though merit should count for something – cause in the end do we want all those educated who do not perform and how many people like me should be overlooked to make things  “fair” - and prejudice was a factor in the decision not to give me a scholarship – but a typical odd call – Pittsburgh won't make a policy and stick to it- it;'s own have to win.   And this about that and they want me guilty for wanting a scholarhsip because my parents were rich – but of course I was not – and they deprived me of income for their kids - - should we not promote merit – or better get education to the point where all can get it – not federally funded necessarily – but much could be done to reduce the cost of providing decent education today and the professors and teachers block it.  - but we are getting into hashed territory – mother was at door trying to stop that – I never did get a scholarship for college – not one as I recollect – there is one I oculd have taken if I went to the University of buffalo  and didn't major in intended major – but that was it.

australia  – allow going after lender if they default – the issue with that – can a lender make a loan where it makes money – but then intends to get the lendee to declare bankrupcy and then be able to go after the lendee for remainder of loan too – I can see a corrupt bank there – if the bank doesn't lose-  if debtor not allowed to default – the  bank gets corrupt – banks would figure out how to make wages slaves and debtor can't shake debt in australia -  only in limited cases - - no – not even  then – to easy to railorad the wrong person into the wrong loan to turn them into a wage slave – if the  bank always collects.  - Banks did this to themselves to fight sharing profit – and banks were pretty profitable – banks do not need safegaurds – they need to fail – or be given competition from smaller banks – make it easier to get large loans gthough a small bank network versus one bank perhaps – do not allow – or better – discourage super large banks – because they got the idea – they could leave a few banks around with similar policies reduce competition and collude to control lending practices and procedures – and manipulate the money flow essentially – you go to BAC or JPM or Chase and if they won't help you no one can – that is the biggest problem – blocking that power – and the gov't own them – I forgot GS- the  honest and “innocetn” secretary of the treasury's home – they feel they have cut the major to the point where they control – oligarchy-  that is a big problem going forward and many are government owned now.  Why is offering foreign currency hard for smaller banks – are big bank services offered well in small banks and why not with growing technology?  Open source with Linux can make a product in time like microsoft and it is a network of people versus a big company – the seed is a company – but the network is the value and no one person controls the network – but I wouldn't put it past Mr Gates to try – and there are regulators – but that is the extent – i have to look closer – but I can see where free source will beat corporations – open source can make a better product than a corporation – getting profit into that is an issue-  but maybe not as thought in theory – corporation made the economic textbooks – saying can;t share – have to own and control and keep private your inventions – can't make a profit otherwise- THAT IS AN UNTESTED ASSUMPTION WITH TODAY'S RESOURCES -  forgot what I wanted to say – thgey want me to fial and not worry about finishing(remembering)  – alright – remembered – after sending a little – barnes and noble did a taboo and allowed people to read in the store and then buy and theysaid it seemed to increase their sales-  I wonder if free source or open source will not increase exposure and use of an invention even as it costs money – door bumped on exposure – just like the arument a while back – maybe earlier in this email – was this the one where I threatened to sue microsoft for cuasing paranoid schizophrenia- that was the last email – full one – the Thinking deeper than cow fart taxes and Poalr bears  - in that I said – Mr gates and many software companies are quick to prosecute for piracy – BUT  - they are not so quick to admit that by allowing a user to use their software – that creates demand for their software and is enough profit made by getting more users to offset any losses from piracy – there maybe a happy middle way - -but when a person uses a program and discovers it is useful – they then want more-  when you fine them for trying something free- as most people who pirate are not full users – you discourage use of your products which hurts your profits – and both actions take place simultaneously – Gates and Co – other Us patent holding scumbags- error on prosecute with patents to ensure payment – barnes and noble is saying – if they can't take home the book but can read it for free- that drives up profits versus pushing them down – we don;t talk about that much – with our phallic washington monument in the center of our capital buildings – pissing on DC showing ownership – Us people are conditioned to be territorial – reflected in our patent laws – and that is where that philosophy may break down – thoughts should not be suppressed or owned – the best idea will come of that- without suppression and ownership = capitalism in computers and software and mail devliery – capitalism has not developed the optimum product and computer scientists face that reality the capitalism and the need for being proprietary – different from a competitor's good idea – does not make the ultimate part – system of computer chip interfaces – ultimate keyborad – the standard keyboard sucks – the military came up with a better keyboard for typing never pushed into use.  In mail – Fedex and Ups and USPS won't mail to each other-  can't mail Ups to a post office box – that's absurd if you get rid of capitalism reasons of Ups is competing with USPS – but the customer wants ease of use and cannot get it because those two idiots are busy fighting and not competing -

one other thing – education – higher education is being advertised  by knowhow2go.com – as competitive nad hard to get -  IT SHOULD BE NEITHER -  this is kfyo ad and I think on hulu.com it has a campaign – education is about nelightenment – NOT COMEPTITION  - and that whole idea of fostering ocmpetition in education will not lead to a person engaged in trying to fulfill themselves in an optimum way.  Itched right side above motuh with right index knuckle – and seeing the price of college rise and a website saying – it's hard to get into college- gotta compete – TO ME THAT IS THE TOTAL WRONG ATTITUDE TO FOSTER – THAT IT SHOULD BE HARD TO  GET AN EDUCATION – VERY TROUBLESOME – UR-DRAXA -  in Dark Sun – the capital of the evil dragon who had a great hand in turning the world into a desert – in his society he made the people warrior dominant – fostered intense competition – in the myth in Dungeons and dragons – those concepts turn a lush forest world to desert -  each person has to fulfill themselves it is not a tough process – more a natural one – it is definitely not like a football game and I hate that analogy – there is discipline in education – but it doesn't hurt much when done right – you learn what you need – what comes – it doesn't have to hurt when it's done right – and people selling it is painful and tough and you gotta compete – NO !! - enough said – but to me these are the opposite direction of where we should be heading – the other side is fostering making education – the thing of the few – that is very scary – Brave New World as a governor said in her gubenatorial – making Gammas and Deltas – and it scares me – that we are doing htis in  reality and it is not staying in a fiction novel.  But as long as their kid is Beta or Alpha – they are okay with it – AARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Whigs that know nothings – next talk show hosts will tell me to eat my broccoli too – is it necessary – I guess no longer do I want to avoid it if others do not come to their senses – the president and Congress are supposed to enforce the Constitution – I do not see this as a time to compromise – they admit no wrongdoing – yes

Jason Lewis for Rush Limbaugh 12:33 Est – 1/13/09



gov't unions printing money if they need more – boy it's halloween

I axctually remember the whig party – no ebay for me – alright -

12:50 EST San Francisco – caller pushing audience to be mad at Republicans for bending over and going along – encouraging revolt – but an unplanned- worst possible strategy for GOP.   Clear distincition between Rep and Dems – issue good government is a blur between Republicans and Democrats – though not having communists in a capitlaist system or controlling it – is a plus.  - sophistry caller-  1 + 1 =3

it is not people with money who create jobs – it is people with ideas – I disagree with normal host and Jason – they -  iforgot what goes here - - but I wanted to say – there may be – think I used they as the wrong word-  there may be more jobs destroyed  by the practices of some rich people then the jobs created by rich people-  ideas and opening up new sutff to get done – that generates jobs and rich people do not have a monopoly on that- many times rich people steal ideas from poor people and the poor inventor does not get the credit.   The rich are doing this whole redistribute wealth thing which will retard job creation faster than anything else I can think of -  12:44 Est. 

$400 dollar deducations to stimulate car buying – caller liked caller in Oaklahoma – ugggg – same old same old – dirty – can't have birthday party – I may not see my 35th birthdeay -

Crane collapse in Lubbock – a lot of those occur in NYC – that is usually God – in NYUC it appeared to be – Lubbock TX has become a battleground because of me it would seem and they stance people have taken – it is intersting to watch the pattern – there is little I should do to help  - others will see to things if need be – but it is interesting that it is this fulll court press on all fronts – the US is at war for all intensive purposes.  Just an invisible war.

my attackers aren't wearing uniforms – again for torture to be real it is not just the pain – it is the intimidation and a friendly force cannot fully simulate that – if your buddies are conducting the torture they are not going to go too far – now the military is a little vindictive as a group – still it's (not and passed gas as I noticed he missing 'not') a person that wants to kill you and hates you inflicting pain – they can't simulate that – let muslims train our soldiers by torturing them – that may be different.  It might be more effective. 


Venting My Spleen Childhood History With Sports and Women – oh I have to go to bathroom as titling this – 12:17 – title made after rightintg section below
yes I am a virgin – no sex issues – haven't looked at tons of online porn and have not engaged in actively looking at it – only really whitehouse.com – when I was looking for whitehouse.gov – but yes dcotros and propylactic comapanies and blackmailers galore and prostitution rings do not like me – a man who is 34 and has not had sex -  ARRRRRGGGHHH  - I guess that is creepy and weird to most people – not to have had sex. - Definitely events influenced that – I couldn;t even produce at a sperm bank and that was weird and i think – I siad this earlier-  someone wants to make sure I am the last of my DNA on this earth.  And that is intentional – Any contact risks that so they blocked all sexual contact -how – my parents sort of kept me away from other kids-  our house did – hard to leave – no one my age to play with – the close connections that lead to dating didn't develop and just the way my mother and father handled me – so nervous about everything – kept very nervous – making huge mistakes – never introduced to women or encouraged by father – both mother and father in many ways made me ashamed to be a man – mother kept complaining about how like she was going into medicine and father made her give up being a doctor if she wanted to marry him so she wouldn't have a higher income than he did – men did evil things – and dad screamed at me a lot and I stayed away from him – more like dealing with a monster – I grew up hating being German and hating being a guy – and no I still – Xavier has a Italian stallion thing to it – with the Italian men – which many of the students are – Italian americans – like hugging and kissing is common – even as a greeting – not like Italy – but people did touch each other more often – drama it was very noticeable – prejudice did the rest – like no one really interested – the only thing that happened – women seemed uncontrollable – a memorable negative experience was a girl I didn't know who called me like every week for 6-7 weeks or longer – it scared me – she wanted to date me and we never talked in school – like I found out what she looked like after she called – but we never talked in junior high – while the parent's laugh – it was planted – it's not natural – even if she did like me that much – to have no fear and call me several different times and I was not receptive – that is really odd – for her to have the feelings and not anything or say something once is not so odd – but it didn't go like that – she called a lot and I could never nicely – I tried and was nice-  but she kept calling – stopped eventually – but that experience at like 13 turned me off to relationship – definitely also my jewish – I will add it older female neighbor and how that ended in 7th grade – she was always manipulating me – certain things – elementary school there was a major incident with her – I don;t even remember all of it – but she wanted me to go up to teachers and ask them odd questions – there was a rational – but I remember being a little older maybe 8th grade and finding out it was total bunk – not true – but she was trying to get me to ask these odd questions – she tried and succeeded in getting to tease another boy – I had no idea I was being used – but definitely my first experiences with the opposite sex were less than perfect – steer clear at all costs – women were devious withces who used men and if you opened up lots of conversation with them negative things could happen – but there were more than that incident with that neighbor – she caused me to get blamed for a lot of stuff in the neighborhood and she started a lot of it – I was blamed because I was bigger and a boy.    And skipping up to high school and the Goodspeed Opera House – well – like the near gay sex incident would have been 6th grade or early 7th but more than likely 6th and the nI kind of broke off the friendship as it made me very uncomfortable – that failed so within a year we had thsi other girl call me up out of the blue – also I never got to be a guy – not on  a sports team – that all went wrong – never a person to look up to athletically – which I'm sure influenced not having sex and not meeting women – but naturally I am 6' 2” and that should not have been a problem – I should have been athletic and it is thoroughly possible – just didn;t get encouraged – things went a little wrong in soccer – at early age so I didn't up having good sports experiences – got hit hard by a soccer ball – like got in the way of a soccer ball kicked full force but took it in the stomach at age 9 – remember that – and father kept telling me I was awkward and this and that – forgot to mention until age 30 that in 7th grade

it's not always the right thing to find out who a person is and what he wants if you get bad vibes – it could Sauron or Satan – Mr schmuckhead from Harvard who is a lying hippocrit from what I heard yesterday and you are playing today too with that line you opened with – I have to find out – no I don;t I can figure you out from yesterday – next -

but continuing – father didn;t really mention until age – my age 30 that he played sports all through school – sort of mentioned – but it wasn't till age 30 he showed me the pictures and talked to me about it – in the “I've beaten you” conversation – it ended sounding like he was telling me he beat me in life – and this would be christmas of 2004.  - during my youth he was very silent on sports and on girls – occassionally telling me I was doing it wrong – but not very isntructive on how to do it better – in fact he rarely showed me how to do anything the correct way before letting me screw up – and if he did – it was as a ploy – correct way to shovel snow- correct way to stack wood – and then you get yelled at if you don't do it that way- and if you do that right – he finds something else to yell at – but the right way to go about a career or girls or sports which he knew – he was very silent  - let me make tons of mistakes and never helped me avoid a few.  I probably wouldn't have been very comfortable with other kids in psorts and that was showing up a little – I remember a pizza party around 6th grade and being shocked at this guy making this huge mess in this restaurant throwing spitballs and stuff in a restaurant – but around there was the last time I played soccer – and it was odd those last seasons – I was on a team that was overmatched – and that not a good thing – not only better players – they were trained differently – we didn't go to the same league – we played outdoors as kids from same area – oh there is the jet plane that is military 9:46 – screw you – we played outdoors and the teams were organized by town – two towns in the soccer league – that shouldn;t have been a problem – BUT – the last year like we had a match first with this indoor team from this sports arena – a sports club – they may have been our age or a year or two older – but they were much better trained and we didn't stand a chance – and in addition we played some teams out of doors that were – I remember being a foot shorter – they were 1 or 2 or more years older so like 12 year olds playing 14 or 15  year olds – it was very intimidating and not a lot of fun – and form their voice change – from their voice – they had gone through puberty – we had not for the most part – along with the growth spurt – and yes – the reason in part I gave up playing was that memory of being creamed that last year – by kids who seemed older or better trained and like their height had 6” as a group per capita on our height – and it was revenge – there were two town – it is sports it is competitive-  my town was smaller – the other town had higher status in the CT pecking order – my team won the year before – it was supposed to – we beat all the team from my town and from the other one – but the other town held majority stake in the league – so next year they divided the players differently – they mixed players from my town and the other town and broke up the strongest players – it was very childish – we didn't dominate all the other teams – we in fact were underdogs into the final game – but the other team was from the larger town and they were supposed to beat us and they didn;t – their thought was to get back at the only small team who beat them – the last game was not a playoff- we had lost – but because we were the only team to beat them all season – they wanted one more match against us to prove superiority – but they lost it instead of winning it – which is why the next year – the team from my town and there were two as I recollect -but ours was borken and it looked like those in control made sure we would never win  and in addition the new thing of playing players who had much different training or a different age – none of which should have happened – but it did – and is an insight into sports- I would encounter the other town next to mine – in high school – in an invention context – my math teacher who I had the most dealings with lived in that town – and in inventing and in soccer they were “highly competitive” - but in both the parents “enusred” their children won – in the inventing competition – they almost cheated – not called on it – but they borught in engineers to help the high school students – local parents – BUT – other teams didn't do that and while the judges said best presentation – and in the end on what was in front of the judges that was fair – it was clear – they had more money than say other teams – one from Bridgeport for example – who did a very good job – but didn't have an actually person in a wheelchair to use the device or a fully made set – which this team did – but that is money – and the real difference in quality in presentation was the money – and it's not really a good way to win an invention competition is to have the better set.   - that was a high school experience too – CT was competitive I guess – I didn;t see as much of that being in a smaller town – butt he Trumbull isn;t world series junior baseball champs – it is there – and I hated that part of the state – I am more east CT than the monied shore and south west CT where like David Letterman and other various scumbags live.  It does not have the same feel. 
But the other bad experience with women was in the Goodspeed Opera House – I again felt very negative about what I saw – I descirbed this before – and to clarify – it was the House manager who told me – she didn't want to see me again – getting ahead – my mother had me go down and ask about auditions at the Goodspeed – I guess at age 16 – but  I didn't want to do it – I started acting because of my German friend who invited to his play – so I started acting – otherwise I would have done nothing in high school – things went sour with tennis team – had to win a match to get into it – when I was better and I couldn't win it – and the year beofre I just good enough and they cut me then too – swimming conflicted with drama – myt father did push me to take a sport in his angry yelling voice saying that most guys take sports – saying that to me  – yet I wasn't really prepared to succeed in a sport – not doing one in junior high becuase of experiences at age 12 – and why didn;t he say something there – he shut his mouth for those crucial when at his age he played sports – but then chastised me at age 15 that I needed a sport in high school – so I felt a fialure for not ever getting on a sports team – I didn;t really want to play – wa heavy in junior high – lighter in high school – but not athletic fresman year – I could have been – I have the body  - but like many of the kids hated me in junior high and I wanted to be away from people – and I kind of needed to feel comfortable the first year in high school – it was going to a larger place – I knew none of the kids – like a kid from Middletown – the place where the high school is based – had a different experience there -

there was an odd thing were there was a mischedule for a soccer game – they told the teams to meet at different fields – one team was told one field and the team another field – in the suburbs these are miles apart – but both teams expected the other team to be at their field – we were early to practice – and we didn't find any of the players my team on the field that was on the paper- so we went around to the other fields and found the other team – who was there-  it was odd because I was the only player who did that-  everyone else on my team practiced on the field assigned on the paper – but I wound up practicing with the other team – and no one thought to like you know – pick a field and just have the game a little later – why that is important – is that team got to meet me AND THE PARENTS OR WHOMEVER GOT TO SEE ME WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWN TO BE AROUND ME AROUND – mother was in control of when we left and such – so it does smell – it singled me out versus others – like things like that- to introduce me to others – there were several things like that – but that is one that comes up.  It just a mistype on a page that caused that and mother's habbit of being very early – and no one from my team being on my field to make us worry it was the wrong field – though mother could have chosen to stay and wait which most adults do – knowing a few minutes can make adifference better than a nervous 12 year old does-  she said nothing and went to check the other fields.  

I got off thinking about acting – which was introduced – cause it raises a new point- if I didn't get into acting – I would have gotten on the swim team – the reason I couldn't get on the swim team was that it conflicted with acting – and it was my German friend who – his family that started me acting – like if my friends in 7th grade were spiked and I could see the negative connotations – and I see the issues in elementary with him – and oddly our friendship broke off in 7th – actually more than one negative experience in 6th grade-  like past the guy down the street who moved away – there was not one positive experience so by 4th grade it was controlled – everyone I ran into seems to go one way -  the German and the Greek are the two they missed – with acting – did they miss them- acting made me wind up not playing a sport – I would have had a very different acceptance level if I had just tried a sport.  And acting happened a year before I thought of trying out for swimming – so it nicely blocked that-   - for one sec let me go back  6th grade polish – some cards of mine were missing – we collected cards – garbage pail kids-  mother threw them all away or I traded a few on ebay -to a military dentist nonetheless – but it wouldn't matter for this – I had a stack of cards I think in my mother's bedroom for some reason – this “friend” of mine who was polish – and it was odd because he lived in a different part of town several miles away – and we didn;t share too common interests and it was odd we ever got to be friends – in addition – the following – he was the only person in this room where I kept these cards and wehn I checked after he left my house – a few were missing a few were out of order – I thought he'd stolen – them  - I accused him of that – his mother didn't let me see him – I wound up having to apologize to him for accusing him – I wanted to see him – I felt guilty about accusing over the next year – I eventually called- mother stayed very neutral and said little – and I was in trouble with him – he wanted to see R rated  movies which his parents forbade and my parents did not – and I got into trouble for trying to show him one – which was around and mother was there – but father got angry anyway – there was an odd scene – yes let me explain – the “friend” wanted to see an R -rated movie – we would have been 11 or 12 – my parents allowed it – his did not – my mother did ask for permission – and got it from his mother – so we started to watch it – my father came up and was the one who stopped the tape and yelled at me – saying I hsouldn;t have pushed mother and shouldn't asked and gotten her to say yes – the “Weakling” mother was at saying yes to me -  WHICH IS TOTAL BULLSHIT BUT WAS NICELY SET UP BY THIS POLISH WOMAN HER SON AND MY PARENTS !!!!! AND AT LEAST 3 OF THE 4 ARE GUILTY I BET -  because it was my fault for badgering and getting approval and then turning on a movie we had gotten approval to see and he was pushing – my “friend” was pushing me to see the movie and I felt bad because my parents let me see it and his didn't and let me see R rated movies and look at playboy and he wanted to do that a lot more than I did and kept pushing on me to let him see that so yes I asked my parents – and I aksed mom over dad becuase mom seemed the more likely to say yes person – but yes in the scenario dad winds up haivng the tape stooped and never letting my “freidn” watching saying it is too much and even though his mother did okay it – father did not want to be responsible-   AND LOOKING AT IT ALL AND KNOWING WHO THE ACTORS WERE – IT IS TOTAL BULLSHIT I WAS BEING FED AND USED BY ALL OF THEM  - I was yelled one for badgering mother to say yes – and two for shwoing my firned the playboys upstairs that father got – even though mother knew-  it was my fault - - and our “freindship” ended with the theft – as I was getting to – I had a particualr stack of cards in I think my mother's bedroom – but away from us – coughing here – and when he left – we were the only people in the house – I had gone through the stack before he came over – and when he left some cards were out of order -garbage pial kid cards have numbers and I kept them in order and some were missing – and we stopped seeing each other for a year – and I choose to call in about year maybe 3 months-  but time passed and – we had one visit after that one – where I said there are cards missing and it was you, mother, and I in the house – I didn't take my own cards – and why would mom rifle thhrough them? - and she wouldn't take any? - and so said let's not go upstairs anymore – and that was the last visit – but time passed he never called again – we didn't see each other for a while I think a year – but not necessarily – but I had to call – and his mother said that he felt very guilty and wanted to give back everything to me – and really dug in – and I had to apologize to him – for accusing him – the thing is I never found the card and it never turned up – so it is likely he stole it – and he didn't want a long apology – he cut me off as I was apologizing – seemingly not wanting to make me feel too bad.  -  In addition around the time he started to talke to me in 4th grade – two other people and one them was polish – talked to me – a little bit – and one of them was also polish – and his mother was like my mother's campaign manager when she ran  for state Representative – but to get the Republican nomination – so polish had some issues to and they do trace – that's the problem – there were a few in high school too  - were there any other bad experiences with the other two – contact with both of them was briefer – one of them played a computer game with me – bard's tale – but there isn't a negative experience – he would have been able to track – I am exhausted and nearly forgot about –

we don't want me to talk about attempted rape at Goodspeed Opera House – do we michael price – cause I ahve gone off on all other siode issues and not gottne back to the that and I am tired – but I will finish out – and get there – which is the last very negative experience with women – before college -

but this got expanded to sports – that is a productive discussion - - I was tracing friends to show that from elementary school or primary school higher years – my “friends” seemed to be spiked with people who gave me negative experiences and yes in many cases certai nethnicisties or religion pop up – yes religions in middle school – it's there – besides the teacher – a student  - indirectly – but it's there -
but I was trying to figure out – greek and german - 6th grade till 8th grade two boys I knew – I have always thought acting was a very good thing for me – singing in particular – but my German friend has ties ot Cornell – which also said no on one of the two days Yale said no – Dimitri's father had cancer – for a while – and he went abroad – became a teacher – mohter showed me his picture in the paper for marriage – acting made me seem like a fairy – gay – and if I didn;t act – I might have played a sport – it's very hard – but yes the only group they missed was the greek and the german – odd of them to miss a group – and the greek has the wrong signs – cancer pictures, a business, studied aborad, and he gets paper coverage – I did accidentally in 7th grade- but never for an accomplishment – the wife of the germans she had some ties with teaching – like mother- actually the wife substituted a teacher for my biology class.  - Dimitri moved in – in 6th grade – even close by – very convenient timing- why -intellectually I was pretty strong – I said with the other guy – it was odd we were friends – because I was more of an intellectual – the greek and the german were more my speed  - they were tracked higher than I was at RHAM – not in their classes until 8th grade and then math only – and I ahd bad experience and that seems planned and I commented on that – but it was painful because the people you were tracked with were supposed to be your “friends” - they weren't in my case – and some trips or things – there was an experience- where – in a place you had to decide what activity you wanted to be in – and I wanted to ask them and I couldn't and the homeroom teacher – said well you friend is right next to you – and I answered – no he's not – I want ask those two  who are in the higher level – homeroom – homeroom was done by track in junior high or maybe by last name – no by track  because A and S were the last names – and I remember feeling bad – and it felt bad – I was friends with them – but in a lower track and told by the public school system I was stupider – there weren't any bad inciedents – directly – the greek was kind of snobbish – and trying to one upsman you – but it didn;t work and there isn't a mark – that I recollect – I have been thinking for a while 11:17 – it is hard – but they would have been the only friends that weren't spiked – and the greek introduced me to the german arriving 6th grade – the german was in another and had no good reason to meet me otherwise – we others pushed my parents into sending me to Xavier – the germans pushed me into drama – with their Cornell and teaching connections – passing gas – drama – so I had to go to voice and dance lessons – all of which mother okayed – actually significant money on dance lessons – which is notable – because little money spent on anything else – no money on sports – it starts to look odd that no money was spent on me for anything – so they invented something – if I hadn't had a negative in soccer – I oculd have played that in high school – which oddly did not conflict with drama – but there was a negative experience with soccer – so I wouldn't play that – leaving swimming and running and tennis – mor than likely – swimming and running – swimming I know coincided with drama – if running didn't – I was always slow – being well-framed – not just fat – but like a football player – running speed is not what I would have – swimming having been certified a lifeguard made more sense – they needed to block that – and yes they could have had the forethought to introduce me to drama in summer of 8th grade or in 9th grade so that I would be in drama in 10th so that when I start looking around saying – hey I am going to go through place never having been on a sports team  -the only logical one is  swimming  - and it conflicts with drama so that by getting me into drama I don;t end up having a sport in high school – and that oculd have been thought out – it does fit all the pattern – the friends are actually negative – which forms a perfect trend -elementary, junior high, and high school – and drama does some key things that some would want – and this I guess is what I was supposed to write up  - I was writing this part last night – in long hand – like getting me to buy metal figures which wound up being useless in 7th and 8th grade another group of kids at that time – talked of them before – and ti connects – I said it all previous ly – one of them was jewish – but I looked at it – and like we played that game one time – and I spent loads of money on those figures after that and never played that game – chainmail – ever again – and they stopped after junior high – but it lifted tons of money off of me and returned little value – it was fun to have al lthe figures – which mother kept – she threw the cards away but kept the figures – threw out the castle parts but kept the metallic figures – kind of odd – could have kept both – took the heavier metal figures down here to NC – BECAUSE TI WAS A VICTORY -  in money nad time I spun my wheels and did not notice time going by – that was the objective – drama acheived the same end – while speaking is a nice skill – I had it as a sophomore – 2 more years of drama did not improve that-  I got not so great parts – the money and energy wated on voice and tap and ballroom – nice to know – but I ahve to admit – I used those skills very infreguently – that same time might have well been spent on science – I loved to brew potions as a kid – in elementary school – mother never transfered that to chemistry a degree she has – we talked of this – my mind went blank – mother moved downstairs – mother admitted to not buying me a chemistry set – which I recently bought – somethig was lipped I think out of my mind – but my main is more important which was – the time spent playing with figures and building castles had some value -but was not too much use – where as time with chemistry – I was good in biology – I could have spent time exploring that – but a person with a phd in freshwater ecology and her bachellors in chemistry – no chemistry set – no projects collecting animals and naming them – mother encouraged very little – dad discouraged me from engineering – which is he was – and not the castles – the castles and figures were 7th and 8th grade – but drama was high school and while I was good at it – what I meant to say above is it took up time that could have been spent learning chemistry or biology or playing with stuff more along those lines – but drama took up the time and knowing how to tap dance is of little use now – and I no longer think that that was unintentional – who controls drama? - in addition – a person i had limited contact with in high school who was mostly in a different track – but out of the blue BECAUSE I WAS IN DRAMA – decides to call me up and offer me a job at the Goodspeed Opera House-  mother did have me go down there for an audition – she woudl do things like that- but mom I have to be an equity actor even to audition – but she pushed me to go down there anyway – and I did becuase of her and they turned me away – she tried to do that with the casino – why don;t you go to New London and work on the casion – mom – I;m not a full architect and ask to do what? - see you're not taking advantage of your opportunities-  what opportunities – they are not asking to hire and besides – that's an hour dirve – it's like Pittsburgh- nad hse moved downstairs as I wrote that – but it's like Pittsburgh – a job is offered but it's too far away so you don;t take it and it's your fault – not a group fixing things so they fall through – mom was similar – seeting me up with projects that didn't make sense and then it's your fault for not taking advantage – yes the casino was large – but it was far away – and yes – here is what I'm getting to here – AFTER showing up at the Goodspeed to try to get an audition and the person who handled the call was the company manager at the time who later became the House Manager who fired me – after that is when my classmate reveals he knows Michael Price – and they need ushers – would you like the job – and i course say yes seems neat- the magic of theater – this is what I was writing about last night – BUT – what jobs did I miss - - they coopted – I was in a serville position -taking tickets – serving coffee and drinks – I liked my theater experience – but I never questioned what else I could be doing - - the usher job was 2 cents above minimum wage – I was turned down as a lifeguard at my beach in my town – others were accepted – we all attended the same class – that is a much more responsible and authoritative(couldn't remember how to spell authorative – sorry authoritative- slowed me down so someone can edit what I say next)  position, it also would make you want to be more fit – in the goodspeed I saw an actress and dancer get hurt which took the sails out of me wanting to be an actor – becuase she broke her leg and was out the rest of the time – and I realized that acting was very ephemeral and in that way not the best thing to go into – and that happened as a senior after 3 years of energy – it looks like I twirled about and spent 3 years in acting and drama and then got out of it – when perhaps it was much better managed than that – got me through high school not doing too much to give me a leg up on a career – actors are gay and fairers – by my size and build – if I did any sports – no one would peg me as gay – but by being an actor – everyone thinks I'm gay and that is used now – and there are no sports on the resume – and if the german friend didn;t introduce drama – there probably would have been something.   But we got to the Goodspeed – I get fired in time – but am there for senior year – I got off this, but with  the lifeguard – I didn;t know it – but I was good with money- just had no experience – IF  I DIDN;T GO TO THE GOODSPEED WHICH WAS A JOB MY “FRIEND” GOT ME  - I would have looked for something else-  I worked as a grocery bagger before – but not as cashier- would have gotten retail experience – learned about theft and being lied to – the people in the Goodspeed were wealthy and better liars – didn't catch them – never leanred – and never saw a real business – never established a history with a company – the theater is odd on a resume – in addition got fired – I charged Michael Price for coffee which put me off balance – because he always tells you who he is later- that made me feel awkward – IF HE WATNED HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT -  I got more and not less nervous around the actors as I stayed there longer-  which was odd and would have become more apparent if I stayed longer – then there was the rape – and some idiot is going to say some thing about an attempted rape should have been reported – ho ho ho – how aobut hypothetical attmepted rape – I explained how the person who did it could have filed a lawsuit against Mcdonald's for a fire that happened there to him a few weeks before the rape – but once the charge came out and he got fired – he could no longer afford to file charges against McDonald's as he needed the job – odd that.   But what stuck in my mind as far as girls are concerned – was the young woman – who as I have said on numerous occassions may have set it up – she was where she was not officially invited – the ushers did not get invitations to parties – for cast and staff – she got herself in – in conversations amongst ourselves – the ushers it comes out that she does butter him up becuase then he will give prime work – better assignment even as another female usher is telling her – tell him no – tell him not to be friendly-  she is admitting she doesn't do that-  the boss is known to be a laides man – or like women – but again has no issues with other women who tell him no -  and I explained before – he worked with a female assitant manager – and there may have been no problems – she worked closer with him and there was no reported incident – but yes – I definitely – first of all I found out – I wasn;t at the party – I wonder if every usher found out – I doubt it – most of us disappeared – in my case forcefully – she did tell us – a few of us – but it was word of mouth – I did get a words directly from her-  confirming that my “friends” who wokred there were not telling me a complete yarn – lying – she confirmed it – but the incident is our boss reaching for this person and trying to drag her into a car – which became a case of rape – car at a party – not very bright – almost oddly not bright – he was a little drunk – gremlin – in addition I was scared of women after this – that evne getting near them might be cause for them to accuse me of rape – and it scared me the most – both of them in my mind have guilt – I don;t know how far it got – it sounds like they were still in clothing – they both have a little guilt – she got off scottt free – even the victim and no – why the fudge were you there – she wasn;t invited or normally wouldn't have been – he got fired – lost his wife – none of this ever got public – yes the goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam CT – hi there – was my firing expensive?  - but I was always very scared of women because of that incident – they are believe if you get in contact – they are right and if it is he said she said – the women wins that one – sort of the case between mother and I – I am less scared now and know with luck what to watch – but yes that incident and the way it was handled-  Mcdonald's won and avoided a nasty lawsuit for burining that guy – I rmemeber names – at least parts of them – but we don't need that – he was burned in a greesefire in a faulty piece of equipment by McDonald's, he was going to sue – he was a manager at McDonalds.   And suddnely needed the job and couldn't sue – very convenient.   And yes a female house manager came in – the assistant left- she was the first person in the Goodspeed to take a call from me as a sophomore – and in college – she felt uncomfortable around me – I came back the freshman summer to work there – I was fired in a couple weeks – I worked for her a little senior summer before going to CMU – when the change occurred but not too much – I came back in freshman summer – and she felt uncomfortable around me and wouldn;t put me on the schedule – stopped giving me hours – the explanation almost didn't occur – I wouldn't even have known – I didn;t like it that couldn't do math and adjust things that the old boss-  all his problems he could add and subtract which kind of was a needed job skill for payroll and accounting of sales – there are a few – not the main thing tickets, but still.   I never got a reprimand or whatever – been there a full year – plus – just decided not to put on the schedule – on a fluke it smeed another girl who was an usher called me up and gave me a small shift to come in – and I came in and found my name had been whited out and the manager said - “I thought I made it clear to you I was uncomfortable around you” - and that was my explanation for dismissal – my first firing almost as classy as my second one.   One class act to follow another.  I was happy with some changes – different name tage that looked cheaper than the older ones, changes in prices to make it easier to count but more expensive in general – and to cover nto bieng able to do math we were charging customers more.   And I didn't like a lot of new people coming in who seemed a lot less worldly than the leaving ones.  The new ushers- I did my job – it didn't matter.   Just didn;t give me hours and when I show up – you don't work here – bye.    An yes that left a mark and I did bump into Mr Price from time to time – the head of it all – who my high school “friend” just happened to know – ho ho ho.   But it was my fault I got fired – oh and now the computer has slwoed down – so let's take off the modem and restart the computer. 
So the goodspeed net ended up being a negative experience – and yes someone who worked at the goodspeed was in my recitation for psychology class 3rd year in CMU – a girl – and that is odd – there are not tons of CT people at CMU with Yale being so much closer.  She new the House manager who fired me.  Ah my computer sped up with the modem off – it's odd hwo that hapens. 
But that experience of watching how just a hand on a woman can result in you getting fired – I didn't want to go near women – and that was a poignant experience.

yes the city of Pittsburgh is sore with a CMU professor or grad student who did a probably sincere and honest study suggesting the city had too many firemen for its size – WHICH IS PROBABLY TRUE – but with the  budget deficit in Pittsburgh – a study suggesting too many firepeople aka firemean was not what the City of Pittsburgh wanted becuase the firefighters watned to keep the jobs and were primary supporters of the mayor- so yes Pittsburgh does not always like CMU. 

3 times as likely to get sick - so out of hundred does like mean you got 3 cases instead of one or 99 cases instead of 33? - one result is more credible than the other - you size of sample could be big to meet the recognized scientific study requirements - but the amount of people who were actually sick could be small - they don't say that on kfyo news - CMU - but yes I get it so you are safe - good - you can tell Pittsburgh you are trying to get me to keep them off your back- they were on your back a little before I became a big issue - which is why there is CMU san Frnacisco CMU oman isn't it?

I do get offended the ay if a West Texan is not the speaker you feel you are doomed – you realize that is the Pittsburgh thing – like in Pittsburgh they won't combine the 400 municipalities in Allegheny so that everyone can have THEIR GUY as their elected official – BUT becasue of that attitude there is not uniformity in city services all fire departments and polciee departments and sewers and power are done differently – police do not have jurisdiction outside of a small area – could you elect an official with a good value – versus someone who “represents you” - I get very tired of that – we want our guy – yeah well we want our guy – when you get to the presidential level – that gets particularly troublesome to have that type of attitude – it's the wrong way to look at governing – good decision over your guy should take precedence – but it doesn't.       I'LL MAIL HIM ALRIGHT

I was overworried about emailing a certain not so high on the totem pole – in the can't think of the museum name – okay hold it – I'm to write this and the email queue is building – you're getting me off trying to remember I guess because someone is playing with that and I won't remember thename of museum complex – so don't qwant to dwell – I guess that is smart – I wanted to tag this with some clandestine nature – but the Lamplight district yes -that is acceptable – that's not quite right but it is good enough – I wanted to make – watching other congressmen suddenly “cut back” what they accept in email – length – which is another way of making sure they don't get meail on issues they don;t want – if you limit to 10,000 characters – you will get issues and not what I write – so I wanted to check that someone wanted this and I wasn't pushing – cause others who used to want it – are sending signals – occassionally – but you are scary and I don't want all of it – is CMU a traitor – I wouldn't put it past them – they can get email and then hand it to Obama and Nancy Pelosi – I wouldn't put it past my alma mater to sell me out – they have many people on the other side there.   How many is the question and where do their loyalties lie -should I dump them like I did Pitt.  Alright no

Military or DoD Website Wants to Play Games – Fine
the dod still goes to account creation – I submit a comment on the first screen – then it goes to account creation – I put in the same email address and it tells me there is already an account and I guess the message is rejected – it is circular and a catch -22- have to create an account but it has the email address already so it rejects the email and won't create the account or accept the message  -  I could be smart and use different address – fudge that- with them – if they're gonna make it tough to talk to the military – I am not going to submit multiple addresses and play games – after the survey – if they want their site to work it will work – there was a military.com banner ad – which is why I went – but their contact site is not working right – and I can;t take a chance with them – if I submit many multiple email addresses to get through will that tag me as a terrorist – I may evenutally try that-  - but they aren't friends these days and I sure they will hear this-  they can fix their site to work right-  they owe me a big apology and i face jerkrface Backy trying and all other morons who will be in power trying to entrap me in a crime for years now – I am not going to walk into it if I can -   - in addition I just tried with arborantractusebay@yahoo.com  and I got a CGI error anyway – but I was right – without finishing the account creation they do not get the message-  but even pushing past that they gave a CGI error – so US military is being highly dishonest and non-credible with me – which is how they feel like playing with me – very well – I get the feeling they will be eating every action they have done to me in the future and I will not give them the other addresses they are fishing for – I know what they want me to submit – they don't have an official document by me of the messages not submitted by new email addresses – in fact I should potentially switch off this one – medicated12manytimes – becuase the military has a record of it – and can tie me to it officially – versus the other addresses there was no account created in the dod – some of them – that period where I had to switch mailing address every day – oh it doens't really matter I'm not really guilty of anything and they are guilty of a bunch if they try it's a farce anyway.  But they don't want contact and every level of now 3 levels to get throuhg screwed up in some way – or the last 2 levels screwed up and yesterday the first two screwed up.  And they do better than that when they want to.

Sen George W Bush of TX taking Senator Hutchison's seat?  - no – sorry – yes the different shades of stone in the washington monument could possibly make someone as green as an Irishman, but they were known to hunt leprechuans – the Irishmen who had to be very clever to escape capture – I guess magic aided the leprechuans when needed – I see – wanted to say something else and I just forgot it – ah yes as an end – Never hold a competition for an architectural design – that's (like) rule #1 or more a committee of decision in architecture invariable leads to a garish mess being and this story is no different – “I am Ramses II fear me” - Percy Shelley – isn't (it) Tai-wan who now has the tallest building? - he could try my case and slap their wrists and prevent further prosecution via double jeopardy – but you're right that want me not to exist – but I do – cool I get to really be Nelson Mandella – NEATO – God does have a sense of humor as is evinced by the two different stone colors of the washington monument.  -uggghh – can't we not have a civil war to make 'em see they're being bean heads and like part of the world may suffer because of it? - I wish -

li-ber-al – it's “cute” - it may not be accurate – you're assuming too much – best to hang a man with own words – than put the words in his mouth that you want him to say – like hannity that resembles what the Democrats did with Bush – and I thought that was stupid – you've gotta know that. 

there is a difference between knowing the mind of God and kind of getting told – in time I want you here – getting more a message – several messages – from whomever they are from – but getting told nonetheless – you're not going to wind up where you thought you were – that is different from claiming to be able to know another's thoughts – but apparently that is possible too – the perfect small bit a rain – enough to harden the sand – not enough to damage the package-  was most appreciated a few days ago.  - mother is saying hello all of sudden 6:43 EST 1/13/09

wwww.foxnews.com got into history after one use – as it was part of the history ASSuMEd it was part of the right address – and yes the wrong addresses get added – I USUALLY remember to delete a wrong address and oddly didn't see it come up or forgot in this case.   Odd that.  Yes they can help that.    And the wrong addrees error help them track the computer 1/13/09 5:58 EST - - mistype of – wwwhitehouse.gov also came up in the history – apparently a lot of bad history.   Again didn't notice missing  period looking right at it.  1/13/09 – fox commercials are crashing – loading and then stopping – like youtube – and they are silent – so I will have to reboot to hear sounnd. 6:12 EST 1/13/09 – still having that to me odd behavior where if I turn off the computer and the modem and then turn on the computer first and turn on the modem later – it doesn't connect to the internet – I have to have the modem on before I turn on the computer – so it can watch my system boot up – that was not always so – that is a new thing.   I ahve to hope that is a security feature and not a virus someone put on the computer.


How Does One Trace What Is On One's Computer
So you can find this out – but can you find out the cards drawn in the tarot reading I paid for in 2001 I guess from that magic store below marine officer's recurting center in Oakland – seeing as they didn't support the war.  And they drew the hanged man – the reader even turned it the rhe right way and not upside down – to try to make a better reading – but they were in on it too -  there was also in 1995 my first bus trip to cleveland a gypsy, fortune teller in Cleveland trying to figure out why I got thrown out of school which I did and what that was supposed to mean.  - he tried to direct me towards a resume in stead of a business the reader did – they didn't wnat me to try the business.   It's all a game. 

to even know that I had downloaded beyond from an abandonware site and I don't even know precisely when but yes it was my birthday and I know which two years – but I was alone in my own room at my own computer – which may assure my guilt – but as I never talked about it with anyone there is only one way you could know what was on my computer during my birthday which if you were watching the screen and pr 2005 – you were watching the screen of my computer – which I know or suspected that was going on – but you can't even use that in court because only with a warrant could the government do that legally and it means . . .  . - maybe it was to log and categorize everything I did on my computer from afar – it also shouldn't have been happening andthe fact that you were going there becomes to me and maybe to others the more interesting question is that people know what I was doing privately on my computer because I never talked to anyone about game playing or anythng in Pitt – there isn't a conversation about what I did at home with anyone – now perhaps you oddly got lucky and checked with the people that ran websites and maybe maybe someone could like go to my ISP and find out what sites I visited – maybe – that would be pretty thorough and I am “surprised” they would want to share precise information like that the ISP wouldn't necessarily know exactly what I was downloading or I would find it interesting if they kept records beyond what site I visted and the download shouldn't be all that chatty – but yes I suppose with very good connections you could have found out that without spying on the computer itself – realistically without a sniffer program isn't it you wouldn't have a chance in hell of finding that – still you would have to dig through the ISP to find out what I was viewing online and like I would think that shouldn't be public information – but interesting to note that nothing is private – today neither what I write longhand, what I type or what I think is private so it is an interesting world we live in.   And definitely I get that everyone knows all computer activity – but yes I am surprised that you could even find out how I celebrated I guess my 29th birthday in private-  as I thought I was alone at the time.  I doubt the ISP keeps a copy of what is downloaded though they would know you were downloading something and you could trace it to a company or the other website provider and find out.

Sleep leads to less sickness - tilted square people - CMU
did you screen candidates for having the virus previously used to test if people got sick CMU? -
zzzzzzz you were just trying to justify not sleeping in class.  - despite little sleep and urinary issues at times and around 5 -7 hours of sleep sometimes less – usually less- 5 – average or so – I would be an anomaly in CMU's – well no – I am not exposed very much to colds – but – that type of study a gremlin could influence- mom can make me feel sick – running nose burning throat-  ican tell the difference between real sick and gremlin sick when it's done – I would be very weary of a study saying sleep is required-  the unions want that study to say certain things – to justify more union jobs and not letting one person work harder with less sleep time.  - I just remembered – like in contracting – they don't necessarily want you moving fast-  if you move fast – you get told to slow down by your fellow workers to not make them work bad- though it depends on who your boss is.   Other bosses are better at fostering a less socialist work envrionment.  I remember a story about the city of Chicago. 

prew – itt -pruit

we're doing chest pangs a little left side. 

Sen Voynavich – wanting to work in a soup kitchen and not being a spring chicken – not usually something said about a Senator because except for Barack Obama who is around my years alive on this planet it is a usually not a question – another “friend” saying “hi” - and revealing the democrats feel they control the Senate of he wouldn't announce leaving – though it was a frandstand not an action. 

I would worry about competing for high student reviews-  BUT – yes they may feel any discernable difference is a problem.  But if you could single out good from bad professors – ti could be used later to fire the bad ones-  the union of professors will read a merit pay system like that – the merit is a reason to justify your job- so who doesn't get it – is getting a message they coudl be fired or not getting merit pay could be used to justify firing – which will make the union fight it in a herd behavior thing. 

the 700lb woman in that chair – regular 4 – legged metal chair – much like the ones I break – she's double my weight at her heaviest and at least 100-200 lbs more than me – but she can sit on a chair like that and here I broke a metal chair like that – nearly 2 – in Ct I borke a chair as I recollect and in CCAC – a theater seat came out on me as I was meeting the egyptian UN ambassador.   - by the way apparently some people have a lot of get of jail free cards – who like got rid of 50 billion -  - but let's see what happens. 

the college of Inquiry- college of something – not a college a group – but called the college of debate or   or osmething like that in Chicago- it was like a debate club-  but with dinner and the people were older – Lincoln – near the brown line – several stops from belmont – you had to buy dinner to participate – and I saw a woman there who was very left at the Harold Washington Library she apparently worked there – very Democratic-  I was good at arguing and that did impress them  - but I ahd no idea about the toes I could step on – politically – that people are very emotional about losing a debate – it's like blood. 

I did have to clean the toilets unclog them at DAM – and they would break the toilets – in DAM – like when they announced the wrong thing – wrong person as manager- Ron – when they announced him in  the old office – immediately two of the toilets were not worked – 2 out of 3 for around 100 people – guess there were 4 altogether – I found a toilet my first day not working – the cord was off - - chain had been slipped off the handle inside – I fixed that – where else- in NC – took the boating course- the toilet there had issues – and the apratment in Pittsburgh on Atwood – but the first one coming back 320 Atwood not 259 – I lived at 320 in 2000 for 6 months – learning how to fix the bath and I guess the toilet – but the bathtube would clog - - locked myself out of my own apartment - - I went over George and his grrey Army shirt and he was from apparently Darien and he was Chinese – we have talked of him – and how I filed a police report against him because he did force entry into my apartment – but just used my phone- they didn;t like it – that I wasn;t working – I had a job with Milan when I started there – but I left it within 3 months and began the thing going back to school – George apaprently thought I was on drugs – because I laughed at the radio – it came up in a meeting with the landlord – but the landlord and he spoke Mandarin – the landlord was a Korean woman who lived below me – I had to fix the toilet in 259 tons of times – but it would get plugged up every time I used it – at one point someone stole the plunger – so I had to get a new one and keep it in my room – but that stopped and it was returned – trouble with the shower – the drain fully plugged – we got a leak in the shower head that became more than what the drain would drain – as 2005 got closer – the problems with plumbing intensified – there was a point when the two chinese – groups – one person and the family – there were 3 chinese rooms – and 3 american- and one random – more or less – there were problems i nthe Korean or in 320 with the toilet- that is how I knew for DAM – I didn't have a problem with the water – the what is the name – water storage and the draining of that into the bowl – in 259 for quite a while if ever – and not before 2002 – so it must be in 320 I learned and I did – I remember opening the porcelain for the first time and learning to fix the toilet there - - milan – ah – well there this point with milan where because of the office moving in downtairs we had to – we didn't have to do it – but the plumber had to dissamble our toilet – the front one in the front office- we had to use the back office- he would rent the back office on the second floor to another architect – but it showed remnants of use and got into with the son of Milan how hard it was to be a plumber and you know dealing with waste removal and how problematic that was with the toilet that had been used – and a little was left-  an oddity in architect's office – and it was a good test of whether I would deal with that- and the plumber also like mentioned in a conversation how hard farmer's work – compared to most of us- that now when I think of that and getting to see my reaction to like a 12-14 hour day – they were testing that.   - the weirdest thing- with the Korean – was because I was an architect – she wanted me to prove it – and asked me to find someone to fix her roof – I did – but it went bad and should have because as the tenant I should not have been asked to fix her roof- she didn't believe I was an architect and was testing – and I called someone art used who I remembered – mistake #1 – and I bumped into his guy in 2002 or 2003 way in the south hills – ah interviewing after i left Milan – so 2001 ish – January – I went on that string of interviews – and I bumped into the guy I knew from scarretti – with his superman letter like logo – for his name- - and the weirdest of those interviews to find a new job after Mlan was an engineering downtown who I showed a plan I just drafted – no architects – I would work as a draftsman – but the guy interviewing me knew the surveyor on the project that Milan used – AND he wanted her to do a project for him but she said she was too busy – so by showing him the plan – I proved she had lied – she worked for Milan instead – major embarassment for a job seeker is to embarass the gboss I was still looking for – and he would never return my call – even to say I didn't getthe job – like I called them several times – and the “does your boss  know your here “ - I guess directly no – but I had mentioned – it was clear i would be leaving – we had talked of that – and like set a date and all – and he knew I copied the drawings – I didn;t ask – but that is because of chicago – my last boss – as I left Chicago – when I announced i was leaving he changed the locks to the office while I was finished up the last month – I gave a month notice instead of 2 weeks – becuase it was sudden – I decided to leave him wehn I found out I was misrepresenting plans to the zoning inspector and he didn't tell me-  it never dawned on me that he may not want permanent people – and if he wnated people to stay he could make sure they did – by churning an office skelletons stay in the closet – onyl his mother had long term knoweldge – consultants came in occassionally – with his developer side that makes sense – but I watned a copy of the drawings I worked on – I did it quickly – right before he changed the locks on the door – I asked him – but then I moved fast – because – just had a feeling – and he says he would have given me a better set – and oddly the print machine was running out of amonia and most of the prints weren't too good – but I got a set – but it was like that – get it before he fixes it so you can't do it – so when I left Milan i was expecting a fight to get the drawings – the business owners get fussy about – but without the drawings an intern or younger architect has no proof they did anything and stealing drawings is common – my friend in a larger firm – his boss left and kept whole files he was taking off the computer which you weren't supposed to do – but he was doing – and the system never works well there.   They – another person in chicago offered me to work at $16 an hour versus aobut the $12 I was making -they were testing how bribable I was- but i would stay in the same office – with the person I wnated to leave – and I turned that down.  Like in Pittsburgh and chicago there were a lot of clues – in Pittsburgh in particular a lot of clues that people kept track of me who had no further dealings with me – I nopticed a little did not suspect the network that exists as long as they left alone – I didn;t really mind – but yes I definitely did not get that that incident downtown – like I wasn;pt interviewed in that engineering firm by the person who was supposed to do it – antoher person took it over- and things smelled wrong – short blonde hair  as I remember- curly – but close – I don;t know – but very negative interview-  and odd he could point that out on the drawing I sued.  But they were all as a group feeling out who I was – because of his son and his son's broken back during his time in the military – the military came up with Milan – but at that time it didn't look like I would ever try to go into it- WITH AN EXCEPTION – I did go to a recruiter in Chicago in 1999 – so they could have known that.   Milan's Slavik – so am I – but I am a Nazi There were many toilet issues in the retail store aswell in NC in 2007 and the parks – peed on floor in 2007 in the public toilets by beach when I had no shoes – this is not in the city and that was odd – and then the marines probably blew up the toilet in the other public park.   They had recently announced on July 4th they – the active duty didn't like me and they chose to announce it on July 4th let me know – not just vets that hate me – and shortly after that in a typical “game” - they blow up the park toilet when I wanted to use it – a perosn on July 4th another guy who was with a bunch that looked military – different from the ones in active duty gear – but looked military and was wearing a Texas A & M hat -  bob Gates' University – or he was Dean there before head of DoD – and that also meant officer – nto enlisted- in addition to a visit in the store from someone who had the right bearing and later within a day on the beach  I would hear - “it's inappropriate” - yes what your;e doing is certainyl inappropriate – I do not know what problem you have with me – you shouldn't and you shouldn't be on this beach as i walk home and know who I am and be delivering a message to me as I don't know you from Adam.  But they don't undderstand that part-  i have no rights with them – that has been communicated.  They are right I am wrong-  they decided.  Whatever. We started on plumbing – sorry – lots of plyumbing issues.  Dinnertime 

the abu-grave incident – it was a nice way to intimidate soldiers from coming forward in addition exposing that anyone who criticizes the military is in for a hellstorm – and they wanted it that way – like it may not have been totally accidental – it was a good to condition normal soldiers to keep their mouths shut – so that any soldier would feel too bad to come forward – silencing all crtiticism of the way things are done.  That might have been the intent and the personal story – was maybe meant to intimidate me – like later oddly seeing an interview of the soldier and his wife- saying it is unfair and how their life is.

when should I stop emailing whitehouse.gov – I am not emailing him =- and while things are set up so it should not be fatal – he should not be president knowing what I know and he intends to kill me – even if he leaves my heart beating – the very least not emailing his administraytion or the dod – seeing as they're so friendly now – seems prudent. 

it appears after several attempts the dod.gov website is barred to me – the contact form never loads rpoperly for me – many spin outs – screens that never load – had to refreshe and restart process 2 of each and there are now 2 screens to jump through for the contact form – there was one up until a week ago and that is problematic – cannot leave a comme nt at dod.gov – not surprised – but wanted to note it – 1/12/09  17:21 EST – second part of contact form did nto load after over 5 minutes. 

a cell phone conversation may require more concentration than a conversation course. 

I get that cigarrettes are US produced where as cigars are central america and bolster their economy – sell tobacco incense if the smell is so pleasant. 

there are no steroids in baseball or football – a player said so – the sky is red

Abram for a marine is a bit of an odd name even for a milleu therapist and especially in Pittsubrgh – the person who watched me take the pill was in on it.  
A Little thinking About the Good Ole Days
the marine and the middle aged in the mental hospital – I was so naive going in there – I know – that means I'm stupid – there was nothing unfair at all about people getting me in there – but there is apparently a need to be fair in Pittsburgh and I guess in Detroit or Chicago either – gotta win at any price – just as long as you win – that is what is imporant – oh a truck on the beach – suburban I'd guess - - no not suburban – station wagon sort of – but the milleu therapist who was middle aged and looked young – she looked young – which is a characteristic of a gremlin – to look younger with age – and they used her quote – in 2007 in the first-  your gonna get it now – back when I actually semi-believed that and semi-cared – I still semi-care – but I look at things differently – but she had that quote the night I first took the medication - “sometimes life is unfair” as I was saying I don't need the medication and she was telling me about her own high blood pressure.  And the marine – who told me he would have fought a lot harder than I would – so much of that place was indeed a setup – and not what it first appeared – and the question is how much – I did have a clue about that by this time – but putting tow and two together – I should not have trusted anyone – people have shown their colors. 

went to daily telegraph which is what I typed in the search which is an australian paper – versus the telegraph which I hope is the british paper I mailed before -  16:22 EST 1/12/09 – it appears to be – don't know why I put daily telegraph instead of telegraph – mind just did that – happens a lot – gremlin  16:34 EST – 1/12/09 – turend off kfyo while3 finding the daily telegraph and when I turn back on the audio – it is gone – I find that interesting .  16:37 EST -  it looks like I have to reboot firefox to get it back.  Which will give away what computer this is. 


Oh Gettin' Religion or Getting Practice
spirituality may well be good for children – though no one who is a kid is settled fully on that – under 18 – even I wasn't settled – it is a good thing- hidden in that may be going to church – how did they define spirtuality – hwo do tehy know children are spiritual – again society approves of church and if you go to churc h you are accepted so society willl make your life easier – and that should affect that study – they didn;'t isolate for that – the effect of – spirtiuality or going to church is expected by society   or approved of and if you don't go to church you get austracized for that – and the unhappiness is not due to your lack of religion but to the austracisim you at first feel from others – and what is spirituality – did they measure going to church as spiritual – is it independent of that ? - you can be spiritual without going to a worship service or being part of a congregation – so there is insufficient information  to be completely definitive – IF I assume spirituality means going to church – then the above statement applies – or I would like to add – assume ritual or going to worship – needing to show outward signs – how d oyou define spirituality – belief or practice – as the two are not necessarily linked – no church has belief without practice – Ahhhh – tRUE(true)  -  BECAUSE BELIEF WITHOUT PRACTICE OR RITUAL IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR A CHURCH OR SYNAGOGUE OR MOSQUE – MONEY COMES FROM RITUALS AND WORSHIP NOT FROM BELIEF – SO ODDLY ENOUGH ALL LARGE CHURCHES HAVE RITUAL  - and don't go as much by belief – but by showing up to church on Sunday or Saturday or Friday – THAT is important – whether you actually you believe your own code – well that is assumed by you going to the ritual – but it doesn't seem to work as a recent “test” sort of shows – Christians – whatsoever you do to  the least of my brothers that you do unot me.  REALLY – your actions do not show that belief – ah – he doesn't count – kill em.    “Look what you've done to our brothers, the one's we acknowledge” - ah but you were asked nicely a gazillion times first – and taking away property is favored over life – life is a last resort – and from what is seen – you may be judged to be in violation of your own ethics and not stopping after many warnings – in which case if  it is needed for one to stop – God has few other options. 

the uk story about the rubicks cube – man working on it for 26 years – I was playing with it like yesterday when the power was out – so people keep track – one thing in bidding with time or money is knowing when not to bid too much and overcommit – and watch the need to win over the needto spend wisely – try goading me again.   - kfyo 16:08 EST 1/12/09 mother onbalcony for some reason.. 

my watch is worth $4 and pruchased at walmart -though I may get a new one in time.

a NY area code for the hate hannity hotline – 212 is NYC – 312 is Chicago 412 is Pittsburgh – showing what it used to be. 

30,000 people – there are 500,000 or more New Orleans – and then there are places so – I didn't want to tear you apart – but 30,000 could or could not mean a fast response – what is the percetnage of people helped – how long did it take to get all the other people off of roove .

The last caller was cute – happy birthday rush – cynthia – among other things she said. 

they two days at labor ready and sorting trash and it was sort of odd to get that particular job.  And the interference having the young girl appear at Labor ready the third day and say if you don't want to do this don't do it-  because it was a hole – I was getting paid – they were trying to exhaust my money.

Employers want energy etc – um in my case they wouldn't interview me.  - and did everything possible not to hire me. 

“there is a reason you have been fired “– both times a jew was in charge – now in one instance several people removed – but ultimately – and someone who knew him got me in there -  
the second time is archtiecture-  getting introduced to the psychaitrists as he threatened to fire me unless I went to see a shrink – and he picked out the shrinks – before that – my other 3rd year teacher had me see her shrink – becuase it was my emotional problems that caused me to fail in 3rd year – or have difficulty-  not the completely bizarre way they grade or that there comments didn't amke sense – a thing is wrong and then it is right – and much of the time there was little rhyme or reason – there was some – but nto always.  It was a game – People are smart in business- oh they're smart oh right – just like a CCAC adminstrator said to me right after I got out of the mental hospital – oh you're smart – in a “your smart but a total moron when it comes to social manuevering” sort of way.  - people in business cheat and cut corners a lot and destroy a lot of good ideas or stay in business by whatever means necessary- which is not fully allowed in the constitution – there is a limit on what you are supposed to do.  - In both cases  as well I was invited to come in – like I didn;t apply – they made the first offer - - I don;t think that was true another time in my life -

and the constant – there is an open – but for some reason they can't interview me and then after the job is filled they tell me there is no opening-  been there several times- and the pride pittsburgh takes at not employing – announcing several times since I've been down here and at other times how desperately they need young people – but yet nothing is available for me – a  nation of liats is it? 

I don't wish to go through everything – but a lot has trnspired -

the last book I ordered recently showed up today and it is again useless or not as hoped , also had strange smell to it – stale smell tobacco again when checked – it doesn't even really cover – just a slight mention of what I thought the prime topic would be – the book i know i might like won't show up and was ordered previosu to this book – and there is a book from last month that just didn't show up – and that is how it's gonna be done – they just won't deliver books they don;t want me to have and amazon may not sell them to me.   They won't be available.  They did that 1-3 times last time – I only verified one order was in stock when I placed and they pushed out of stock when I palced the order – this si amazon and would not deliver.  - and of the 7 books I ordered – the two that came were the most suspect – they could have others to get the financing that would have been better – any of the other 6 that did not get funded – had $10 and I expected $40 – so Iordered books for $40 and not $10 – and they picked which books got the funding and gave it to two I would like the least - - in addition the refund sent away for on the 7th – for antoher order has nto been granted yet – they do say up to 3 weeks.   We'll see. 



called up pumpkin on the web – got jack-olantern images to come up from yahoo searhc – meant to type another word. 

Japan website running a website to identify smells – locating a place by smell - - I did get a hint earlier today to use a particular thing with a known smell and now a news article from Japan on kfyo about smells – just an odd coincidence.  -

what is this can I figure out who I should and should not talk to ?  It's getting harder.   I'm feeling more consdervative than liberal in picking new “pen pals” . 

I will take the president elect at his word that he wants the advice of the minority party – keep your friends close and your enemies closer is the line I think

Bloggo – had handicapped people that he claimed to be helping along with the reciting of poetry – so he is making odd references – they portray me as handicapped.   Ugggghhh – and he had the poetry and the misjustice of the system – oh brohter Chicago – you would do this. 

homes closed per day is not net homes closed per day – how many homs have been bought?

It sounds like the Federal Senate is dancing with the IL State Senate on the issue of Burris – getting into how things should be run and I am guessing the federal Senators are not happy with the precedent of letting the state do, whatever.  

I use neither mouth wash nor cough syrup – I remember someone who swore by mouthwash. 

start closing eyes and having trouble focussing as I try to email clinton founedation – like I am lacking sleep – then the door was bumping as I came throug that – 12:44 EST 1/12/09

I have habeus corpus – really?  - not in Pittsburgh – automatically guilty of something

get some skin in the game – Nancy Pelosi used that phrase too – as she announced her presence as did Schumer – like their little games with me – schumer was the Dod asking in a survey if I worked for a government agency and I didn't know it was illegal to answer yes when you don't – and I didn't  but in most surveys I may choose to lie, there it would have been criminal  – Nancy – got me to email her twice with two different lies – or using the reputation of thers – not perhaps with their consent – other congresspeople – not house necessarily – and Obama is getting some skin in the game – oh ho ho ho – he just said that phrase too.  Get some skin in the game – expose yourself as part of it – so you have to nail him too to survive. 

When rich start loking for bargains economy goes to hell – it shouldn't – shouldn;t affect walmart - - maybe aprt of our economy is artificial and done falsely and the reckoning has come? - mark ups won't be tolerated if people get a discount now – that will jsut change how money circulates – it has to all work later – that's not a long term problem -there will be a shift – but the idea that you have to have falsely inflated markets – no – that has never been a tenant of capitlism – that is a tenant of osmeone who own a company based on that and who does not want to change that- - full price luxury items – should always have  a hard time selling.  - bailout of rich – uggghhh- Limbaugh !!! - it is already a cartoony sitcom. 

it was 10 million and you asked for more like 20 milion as i recollect and they put it to 15 million. 

And some right thinking people are missing as opposed to a paranoide schizophrenic hamster like me about torture is that torture is not done in a vacuum – an enemy has control of you and may or many not want to kill – that is very different from voluntarily enduring pain from someone you trust or feel is friendly -

I know brute – I don;t know of jade east -

Kathy seemed to be saying they might try to kill me via special forces training - ugggghh - what am I suppsoed to feel - they are already trying to do so much and now this - kill him - -whatever - her dad was inspecial forces - don't negotiate kill terrorists - they consider me a terrorist.  coughing as I write that – I am interested to see how the free and fair – land of the free, home of the brave USA govenrment handles my case -as my own countrymen act like the biggest cowards and try to butcher me. 

Kathy is – 1 military memeber on the plane -  Reagan lied – we do negotiate just not officially with terrorists – people were negotiating over me since the get go -

- I knew his name - some small businesses are well run – should survive – MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE METRIC OF BUSINESS IN CAPITALISM -  community and this and that and the next thing are not supposed to be in the equation – and Neal is preaching the opposite of Libertarianism and lying through his teeth – or he may do those actions – but those are not the actions of a libertarian -

first caller said he was with the SEAL teams ( his point was the left had a field day with abu-grave – and imp-lying keep other things silent - ) - what has been done to me should not be legal – permanent imnjury – you have derailed their lives – and in abu-grave – you did violate your own code – and somehow – that doesn't matter – you talk a good game about ethics – but when it comes down it – you don't really believe in them – look the other way it's inconvenient – If you cannot see your faults – and if you could – then like you would learn not to repeat them – like if you could make the argument if it were not reported you would stop doing it – that  might be okay – not completely – but things could be done differently – but you – nothing is wrong – we are right – we gonna keep doing it – we know best -  AND YOU DON'T -   and they are still playing a game with call spacing  - the next caller dropping things-  a saying of mine – I just forgot – and then he dropped comcast the pittsburgh carrier – he said a word I say – hyphenated word  - I know they are seeing what they can get past me – using geting a rise out of me – and then pushing soething past me – whatever -

don't the speculators own rights to buty and rights to sell – it's not just a bet – is it like options where you get the right to buy – and the seller has to be able to fulfill so many contracts – and has to worry about them all coming at once – and in that way – oil may not be out – but contracts to buy oil are out – the futures or speculation could affect the price.  You make ti look like a lot of people MIGHT buy oil at once -  but many of them are lying – and the commodity exchange didn't plan on most ofthem lying or doing it for reasons other than wanting oil.   Rubbing right ear with  right fingers as I think – nothing in a commodities market ties a person to use the commodity be productive with the commodity – versus speculate with it – nad really if the market is about trading – the reasons a person should be in the market should be trading reasons – the question is can governmenyt regualte out some speculation – for now I don;t want to propose that- maybe looking at contracts used versus contracts outstanding and restricting how many contracts can be called upon based on how many contracts actually get used – not just held.   If a bunch of outstanding contracts are out but little oil is used – the supplier cannot be required to fill all of the other contracts at one time – because in a real market – used and held contracts  should only be so different.  People shouldn;t in most cases being buying a contract just to hold the onctract – though there is gold and people invest in gold - - certain things like wheat and oil – are they different as commodities than gold – and they should be targeted as a business investment and not a speculation.   I am not going to ponder long enough to give a definitive opinion of mine right now -but it is a quesiton – should limits be placed on how much you can specualte on commodities you do not consume?  - kfyo – the totaltransformation commercial – 11:21 EST

google searches – 2 equivalent to boiling tea in amount of energy used – boiling a pot of tea – really? - plasma TV size regsfor global warming – NOOOooooooooo!!!!- insanity – world is insane.

with the internet age and psychology – more work has been done on what makes a person gives in – and it is not just breaking a body part – you can only do that once – see darth vader in star wars the radio version and his dialogue with princess Leia.  - torture should be coercion and yes at time it should be used – but starving and thirst and other ideas are forms of coercion.  Thirst and hunger can kill a person just like body part issues.  Damaging the body directly – and it works better because – you didn't do it fully.. 

internal server error when trying to email ron paul – 2 occurrences no success – usualy doesn't happen.- so ron paul has a length limit that's new -  

I jes don' think good – we's not using britsky style english – it don' sound right

torture is a horrible thing – but the person is alive-  um – I want full use of my mind to be considered alive – and ability to use its faculties – alive alone does not count in my case – shutting down my brain and keeping my heart beating sort of like a pithed frog mother used to refer to – that  doesn't count as life-  nor does being locked in a palce and need being able to sue my mind in that palce – locking me away and keeping me from things to be able to access my mind – have to be study – read as I want – to call it life- if you interefere there – to me – that is the same as death – life is with the use of mind – not without – and any method of interfering with use of mind.  There is always some in society – BUT – trying to restrict it – is the same as death – letting someone live without using mind. 

why people keep using the same method if it doesn't work – is neal talking about torture or socialism or mob style coercion. 

torture is whatever works and gets information - - liberals giving 24 air time and response and publicity so they are tacitly supporting the “24” series.   -

neal is suggesting – nevermind – we are there.   Telepaths in b5 tortured people – didn't touch their bodies-  didn't look too nice. 

trotski assassinated – noted

domestic assault older manb stabbed woman and she hit him with beer bottle – man is found guilty – woman is not – older 66 yr man and 40 women – I am34 and mother 68 or close to that – I will be blamed in an assault is the point. 

Better All or Red or Dead versus Better Dead than Red  -eh
Da Comrade – zee “permanent revolution” - sorry i didn't look sooner – yes someone may be using trotskism as the model – you mean it wouldn't be cool if Russia and China wound up the most capitalist countries on the globe as the US and Europe adopt socialism – pass the bread and water ration it's all you can have in the future – the question is I guess will all the Democrats endorse this or will some of them say no. 

Only looking for a small local business to buy stuff from to keep them in business- WHAT (THE) FUDGE ARE DOING NEAL BOORTZ !!!!! - YOU'RE A FUGDING A LIBERTARIAN – SHAME ON YOU – YOU NORMALLY ACT SMARTER THAN THIS -  duh – part of the capitalist economic system is that in a downturn – small businessesthat are not strong go out of business – that is supposed to happen – if it did not – we will still buy milk from a milkman and ice from the ice man – we would support ineffective businesses – I know Pittsburgh does that – and they can't see that – but they're morons and don't want to hear the truth – inefficiency – places you don't go to naturally should go out of business – I am not buying necessities right now.  Still an evil capitalist – trying to keep alive the places that I like to buy things from – because they are a good business model – I don;t need prompting to go there – actually not supporting – I am not changing my behavior – other than spending more where I would spend it normally - - but I am not trying to keep alive places I don't get a good or best value at – I may make an exception with amazon if they actively help the other side – and won't give me products I order – but then – that is bad service as a retailer and I should leave anyway – because they are corrupt.    But buying stuff to keep a place up – that is socialism not capitalism and I thought  libertarians opposed that. 

glenn where do you find these nutjobs? -  control, independence, and ownership as wrong – family and character first – what is character by his definition -  false goals of independence, control, independence – I don't want to need – I want to stand on my own – we are interdependent – but part of that is being able to say no to – he doesn't have short true answers – he circumnavigates – I didn;t hear the full – but neough he jumped - - we are not interdependent for how we choose to run our lives – you are not unhappy – other people make you more unhappy than does being alone and free -  caller guest – lead us away from dependence on God – as it should be – not worshipping a false idol – who is the author to force others to read his book a certain way – he does – half the book upside down – the author controls the reader as he preaches against control – hippocrit!   False prophet whitened sepulcher – 2 covers like japanese anime – manga -   his thing on surprise - and total control that he learned from Harvard - that is the operating idea behind the other side - that they can plan for anything - I think that is not true - certain things you cannot anticipate - zen teaches never to anticipate to just react - he is chiding the philosophy at harvard of never being surprised yet his own actions suggest he supports it - he controls his readers.  No glenn - uggghhh - I have to listen to all these morons - I guess people do believe thm - so that have to be addressed - ugggggggghhhhhhhh

masnas – so communication can get very subtle – and yes I get it – it dodn't happen for the cleric – it didn't happen in our military – I get to fall down the stairs and die too – odd way to “fix” things in A WESTERN “FREE SOCIETY”

glenn 24 is justifying my death in their eyes – it's negative – negative normalization to certain ideas - - necessary to tortu- had caps here by mistake and erased - - necessary to torture and kill to protect innocents - 

Banning outdoor smoking in La – you could ban Frowning or looking mean in CA – mandate every person wear a smile on their face by law – happy people in CA – it's the law. 
so mobile homes are liked - hmmm

empowerment sounds like hope and change without details.  - no intervention by king –  (people want to ) succeed on their own (without Dad and govern themselves effectively) – who won the presidential election? - ah  also the role of the electors – which is not a formality - which is what Democrats said - the electoral college is supposed to be a defense against a bad presidential pick by the public - one might see this election as a failure of it - that it doesn't work - we do want to succeed - we do have someone watching society to make sure we don;t mess it up too badly.  And that person may act soon - as we are messing up.

environmental groups – yes being a politician means never fully criticizing.  
frontline to homeland security is CIA -

itching back of head with right hand 8:38 ESt 1/12/09

If we don't do something economy will slide away - some expert on nbc - yeah and if we keep shoveling money into people who don;t use it to help get us out of the mess of the economy - we won't have any money or resources available when we figure out what  to do about the problem.   wasting 700 billion dollars and now possibly 1.7 trillion - getting to be 2/3 to 1/2 the normal budget - um - why does that NOt seem to be the way out of the crisis of 7% unemployment - veruss other past figures - even michigan with its 13% or something is still around - again once burned twice learned - there have been a lot of fires in these perfect storms lately all over the country. 

new internet bug forcing reboot of computer – same error as 6:40 – well different it generated an error report as I swtiched windwos – and then I tried to pull up a new window and not file the error report and it stopped-  have to rebott firefox to use internet and I usually retailate by shutting off the modem to mask my ip address – and they have been responding by shutting down internet service.  Goingto email boortz.  - 8:06 EST – again – internet service is down – upon reboot 1/12/09 – turning off and on while keeping modem on – got the connection back – but the kfyo site did not come back like others – I had to reboot a kfyo site from scratch versus – having it load up l,ike the others – one more experiment.  Kfyo had the white error screen – silencing its audio stream..  8:28 EST  -

lobbock fire destrioyed high school – lotney nigh school - - another in garage in home – and I believe a third fire - - and a brush fire elsewhere – we no longer need one day for halloween – and the host had a near fire with his car – attacks normally fail and the person who attacked loses someone or something they value - - just thinking out loud. 

blogojevich – the state impeached him – I guess-  but they ahven;t removed him from office – they are manuevering – he will get a clinton impeached by not removed – and they plan to do that – the state legislature is scumbag – because – this is not about sex – it's about other stuff – and they are saying – Obama is in – we are in power – screw the law.

Karl Dietrich – in MA – making a flying car – developed by NASA – we don't need a flying car – drug traffic will skyrocket – and it is odd where people put their money nad resources – versus other things – robotics – to increase industry efficiency or – have to test the car in alaska-  only state legal to take off – Governor Palin – we don't need this  - ti is not ethical to like block it outright – the secret service has to do that IF it is done – but a cheap small plane with lots of civillians – drug smuggling patrol will suck with this – ha ha – I jetted across the border – turn ATF and there is another DEA.  - I guess a mobile home can move too and that is an issue – but should be a contained issue – but I hadn't considered that-  a mobile home is not the worst place for a drug dealer to have as a base – though a drug base in a small one would be hard.  Maybe not hard enough.  We do have mobile homes now and they are not drug bases as far as I know so the option is not that attractive apparently.   

ad council father iniative – black female voice – my father is great – calling him anything less than great is unacceptable – done in rap – of ccourse I just ripped my dad about for his flaws namely he wanted to throw me out of the house several times and didn't want me  -  the hulu ad while we are from the ad council – the federal agency – but they did another commercial on bad accidents of 4 kids in the car and an announcer appears – they are normalizing 4 kids – young kids being in a car with that ad – which should be discouraged – the kid shouldn't be in the car – speaking up is not a good solution- in the back you might not get lsitened to – a better message is not to be in the car – that may get in a wreck and the ad  council didn't choose – that – it subtly is normalizing teen parties – they always happen – well I avoided a lot of them – there is ONE time in high school – I was in a car with 7 people – compact car – but we didn't do that again – and the ads should discourage getting in the car – and they don't.     People distracting while you're driving when yougn – there was an incident – oh boy – even there there were issues. 

near explosion of car for kfyo host – gas leak from the car – ah my door is bumping and I just passed gas – yes they are threatening the radio hosts I listen to as well.  Ho ho ho ho ho ho

I would have trouble pulling out my eyeball like that prisoner – I didn't want to get into that – saying I couldn;t – no you got me – I wanted that secret – thanks – but I do have some pain tolerance – I don;t want to try – I DON'T WANT THE MILITARY OR WHOMEVER TO TEST MY PAIN TOLERANCE   - but yes I have some tolerance for pain – which is why I could in the house in the last five days and that was someone's point on Saturday – to be able to get up with the pain in my calves was difficult- I do not want to pull out my eyeball right now to find out if I could do it – just like when I was thinking of cutting my wrists in 2006 – I couldn;t fully bring myself to do it – because I didn't really want to die – not bad enough to commit suicide – so I couldn't cut in a serious way – never forget those fun first days of 2006 all thanks to the same people who wnat my internet shut off – and the mental hospital and the shock of being dragged into that system – not even that could happen.   And getting dragged into the hospital is what made me suicidal – I wasn't getting suicidal UNTIL the doctors touched me.    Coughing as I point that out.   But your will – what you want truly comes out with pain – how bad do you want to do something.   It came out I didn;t really want to play around with dying -  Icried for 2 months straight – cried and cried – the  tears didn't stop coming up I would lay on the floor and cry for hours.   And mom approves of getting rid of me and of that or if she doesn't approve she is wiling to look the other way as apparently is someone else pretty high ranking – which is interesting – but whatever.   If it's time to call an ew country home – it is – no not just yet – but backy is going to have something “occure” to me if he gets in and have me quietly disappear – permanently – God is stll out there and Bush is not out of office yet – “snow clouds hang low and threatin' – maybe it won;t, praying ti may”.. 

I just had that error – 6:31 EST turn off and on the browser to getr back audio on video and radio -  but I usually do more to prevent the tracking – which seems to cause the internet to go off my comptuer  - I did want to hear someone  - they will pull my computer now at 6:30 the line won't be repaired till 8:30 when others use it – let's test  that – the turning off and on the modem that would be a signal the power company could see – phone company – so when I turn off and on the modem – they get the message to shut down my internet line – the kfyo sports broadcast was ending as I restarted firefox – proving that the video error was one of those that – the audio stream on radio and television goes down – and to get ti back I have to restart firefox – which must tell someone who I am – but I just realize when I turn off my modem – or make activity here like that – it tells someone in the phone company who I am so they can shut down my line and black out my internet-  before they don't know which line it is potentially – and it made sense – and it did happen – the internet is out again – from the service provided – the same  error – like last night – it was odd – it came up right as – it prevented the monologue of Allen Hunt – at the opening so he could say anything to me – that was their objective – I think I have your number now – you peridoically shut off my internet connection  to block people from talking to me - 3rd time this has happened in 2 days.  No I haven't been giving mother a check – but the phone company shouldn;t that as she has been paying the bill – and I can choose to do that – you thought you had a $35 ding every month that I had to pay – but I don;t necessarily have to write that check every month – but you're mad that I don't so you shut off internet service-  even though the phone company is still getting paid – just I am not paying every month and you cannot control my Disposable income like you are planning – you ASSuMEd I would religiosuly pay monthly bills – but I can choose not to – but you don't like that because it throughs off your count as to what I can do – and I can make your fix in amazon and ebay harder becuase you can't control things as well.   So you're going to shut off my internet service every time I shut off my modem – that is illegal or I could sue the phone comapny for that – the modem isn't the problem – you create artificially – and whomever is doing that is not supposed to.   7:05 Est – internet is back – it appears leaving the modem on – while shutting down the computer and restarting may fix the error – that has not been a problem in the past – I didn;t shut down often – but often enough that I should have noticed that issue if it was there before – I did cloak as a hamster before – which involved shutting down both – I think it is a new thng that my internet service gets shut down too – not this time it was 20 minutes.  - by shut down  - all internet sites -stopped here – rubbed top of head with right hand as I realized  my ind was in an infinite loop – but by the internet is down – all the internet sites get that white error screen – none of them load up – again – yes I turn off the modem more often now than before-  but i have been turning it off for a while – a month – and there were reasons of course in the past to turn it off – in this system since july 4th – the last time they destroyed my windows system – never had this error before or this thing where I loose internet service every time I shut off modem and computer – I would surmise a hacker is mad that as soon as he tries to silence the audio stream on news – forcing me to reboot firefox which let's I bet other hackers or goblins know who I am – I shut off my mdoem – changing my ip address I hope and online id – and they respond now by pulling my internet connection now as punishment – they aren;t supposed to do that  - but they aren't supposed to do a lot of things. 

1/12/09 – someone has to make herself known as a guest in my ming in a directly provable but indirectly  provable – as trhe phrase she used last (night) – right hand rubbed up over forehead as I forgot the word and had to add it back in – passed gas as I wrote – as the phrase she used last night is repeated over and over – I awoke at 3 am to go to the bathroo which is better – but got up now like 5:13 EST or so and you feel groggy versus refreshed getting up and I had to fight for control of my mind – um wanted to keep my eyes shut and that was her – I used to wake up like wanting to do everything – she can dull waking up apparently – but a phrase she said last night was being repeated over and over in mymind – and yes she apparently infinite looped me for 2 hours – which is hwy I feel more tired then refrshed getting up – nad yea h I bet certain don't like having to track me at 3am – but tow can play at games – I know others can cause me not to go to sleep or to wake up if need be.  She does not have full control if others want other things to happen and no I don't like my sleep being played with in some fashion on a nightly basis – but so be it – it's not supposed to be and someday that may matter. 

It's a nice littrle (hamster- itching left forearm with right thumb as I add this) that can't do anything – OR is it not so little a hamster who could've done anything and was asked to do nothing and complied and someone sure is asking for a refresher course in that point of fact – IF SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER PEACEFUL WELL FED DAY ON THIS EARTH THEY COULD ARRANGE THAT AND IT MIGHT NOT BE A CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST ON THE TRUE PECKING ORDER- but for now the hamster will be playing in his cage oblivious to working out such details, other kids will play as they choose and may not be too happy - “Ihave so much dirt on you with your writing” - Excuse me – ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earthquake to earthquake  - paper and gavels don't stop earthquakes – people haven't discovered that yet – I don;t like this thing where we have to show off – and part of it is – we want them to do whatever- make that move – AND then completely undo it inf front of their eyes – but it is what is going to be apparently.  

I do have video issues on the newshour and cbsnews,com – in both cases the video stoppeed- 1/11/09


there was a stray blank character causing errors in my email list – the error window for that kept popping up – very possible like return and tab and what not have different values – I worked with programs luckily and know a blank space can mean different things nad screw up a data file – but that was interesting that a blank space was causing an error in the mailing – error window- the edit of contacts does nto confrom to expectations – not quite that – but that the changes in the contact window  aka the emil addresses themselves caused the error – which is a new one-  but I guess I did something and the fact that a stray character was the issue is just a coincidence. 

23:01 Est and yes to whom it concersn mother did have to come up here even at 22:44 EST and do something – after I took a shower – even though its night – she still came up here – I do not get why that is so crucial.   Itching lwft side of head with left fingers.

Bill Cuningham 1/11/09 – 22:15 EST listened – written up – we'll see when  on 6:28 EST 1/12/09 finished

Frank Gaff – Arabs just have to get lucky once – not completely true – Israel has more than one layer of defense- certain people might help it if the arabs and persians who are its neighbors went to destroy everyone in Israel – so it is not so critical as is said – trying to ramp up the need for Israel to strike at anything is a cover  -
Challenged the democgraphic data showing plaestinians will overtake jews as the majority in the country – but more oncircumspection than on numbers – coughing as I write that and passing gas – he had no real good basis given other than saying some jewish families are competing with palestinaisn for births – but that is not in the end saying much – tooth pain hoho

this guest was saying – Obama and others are stupid in trying to accomodate muslim states – that this policy is naive – they want to kill us if Israel isn't there as the first target – one could go into the primary objective in truth of Palestinians may be their land – now it would be nice if the words “ move on “ - and not in the moveon.rog sense – but just move on – ytes one could see where a lot of land was taken potentially -but 50 years of fighting has not brought it back – would you be better off today if another strategy were employed where instead of being wedded to that land – trying to get successin another country or somewhere else? - I am starting to understand the dig in thing – well no – I have to admit – I should have left my country last month – certain people don;t want me to – want to play this out – or there is enough to suggest that – and I want to give them that shot and that may be staying for a while – but if it gets to – the military wants to do the – nothing happened dance and a president is going to acconomdate that – and that is the strategy on the other side – stopped – and passed gas as I realized it – heard a groan too from downstairs – if the government in full tells me in my situation – DEAL WITH IT – I will try leaving – don't get wedded into someplace where people are going to be pains in the asbestos – life is too short and long term it's not profitable much of the time – you give up too easy – to win you have to have a strategy to win – blidnly fighting just to deny them full victory doesn't cut it – doesn't getyou anywhere – only in the worst case – even in the worst case have a strategy for winning – you cannot help others most of the time  if you yourself need help.  - got off of this itnerview fast ho -ho – onto a major sidelight – and exhaling – that is a sign used a lot at night too – an uneven breath -  - touch left index finger to right thumb. 
Shias and Sunnis would kill each other if jews and Us were not there – this guy is a guest on a right wing talk show and yes the military people and right wing christian god loving people – sort of – some of them believe like that – that the Arabs and Persians are little more than animals – passed gas as I write that – and that if the Jews and US weren't there to keep them in line ( I wanted to add which country decided current middle east boudaries which we use today – oh right wasn't it the UK?)  – they would all slaughter eacher instead of work things out – oh remembering show seems to knwo if I am touching the bed  - pressure on skin – by sensation – that is what can be detected – but yes the Shias and Sunnis would likely war with one another without any in US or Israel around – people in europe nad in the US kill each other occassional too  - but there is degree and over what is important – muslims in the past were capable of a high civilization – and kind of the racist argument that they are just capable of fighting each other – what is funny – not funny – darkly humorous and ironic – this guy has a really affected air to him and he is on a right wing toalk show trying to appeal likely to a blue collar crowd with what he says and he comes off as very much an academic and pretentious -
Lastly this guy says – touched thumb – he hopes the jews would lash out at those who threaten the state of Israel – that could mean me – but why – if that is the middle east – see – he didn;t say Israelis he said jews – and “threaten the state of Israel” - that could mena a few things – and why do I bet the UN state of Israel is not what was meant there – but the dream of a full Israel – uggghhh -
There isn't as much to refute- just a heads up that this is going on – one other thing – he did repeat that comment about jews being put into the ovens – and that he hopes jews will not go quietly into the ovens this time – that was the comment apparently made in NY protests by the UN and the of course I didn't catch it – but yeah the comments in Canada and the NY make the mulsim look like unthinking animals justifying letting everything in the mideast go to hell – and we have a new PRESIDENT -  ARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! - it's not even fun to say that- this is serious – they are fomenting a new war or complete conflict in the mideast – they want it to happen – you see the signs – can't we stopthis pattern – I scream every day and or try to make it known -  WATCH THE SIGNS THEY WANT A WAR WHERE ISRAEL ATTACKED JEWS DIE BUT I NTHE END IT GETS JUSTIFICATION TO TAKE MORE TERRITORY – THEY ARE TRYING TO FOMENT THAT AND ARE TRYING TO SIGN ON US CHRISTIANS AND US AND ISRAELI JEWS TO DO IT – AND DO IT IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES  - it's really frightening – to see Much Ado about Nothing turned into a tragedy instead of a comedy – where there is something going on – there is political manipulation and the press is cooperating to create conditions ripe to start another war – which may not benefit the US – and is not  thing to do – and Obama – like he wilol let Afghanistan and Iraq fall apart if possible – so it all works together – unrest in Muslim increases as political protests give stronger negative opinion to Arabs – we'll be at war soon  much more strongly than we currently are- and people are fomenting that- in short – duck – trouble is coming.

60 Minutes  1/11/09
ARRRRGGGHHH - oh that is Scary - Goodbye Afghanistan -Shhh Don't Tell
I can see things in people – many older than me – it is not fun sometimes – it appears to be President Bush's will that got the US through the Iraq war – and helped in Afghanistan – he overroad the generals as I recollect when they said no and he wound up making it work – Atlas Shrugged is about an independent man isn't it – and I guess how necessary that can be at times – I am reading that I have not had a chance to read the book or have not made the chance – due to things occurring at his time – I hope I will have that opprotunity at my leisure and full independent discretion in the future.   Put slightly more bluntly but obtusely as I feel that is best -  AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!! - always well fed as an admiral and everyone lies to you - translated to potentially - you are "lying" to me and will be starving soon while I will be well fed for pretending you don't exist.  - luckily he is not the one holdingmy fate at the end ofthe day - two other people are less like that.  I hope.  - Father – aka the guy who croaked last year at 71 – had that attitude – explaining to me that with you get fed for free as long as you don't ask what you're having – a kind of similar statement – and that is a paraphrase – but the meaning was – you eat what is put in front of you and that way you get fed for free – my dad had a fair amount of talent – if he wanted to use it – but he had the same mindset – yeah he got 71 years and that is okay – got to retire – got to watch a few shows on TV – decent run – he nebver went through what I'm going through now – didn;t have a ball at work – hated his job – put up with – got his pension – that's how he did it- he also stopped living like I guess at 40 and just went through the motions for the rest of his life – he wound up not being my hero and his body was recycled for parts within a few hours of his death – and he has a few patents to his name owned by UTC – that's his life – I'll take my few books to my name and my ideas and what I stood up for any day over what he got – I tried – he stopped trying – I don;t respect my own father – saying to me – I'm old and I worked and I retired and I ought to be left in peace when I really needed help and he had a clue that that may be the case. 

......  adding the other stories tomorrow.  - can't sleep – one thing – the singer not wanting to be a leader – point noted – there is a time when there is a right decision – still a lotta people are allergic to hamsters. 


Oil swaps – kind of like housing swaps I bet – and enron passed these changes , you don;t say- but whatconcerns me – this could be done in other commodity markets-  if we switch to natural gas – aka T boone pickens – they could do this all over again -  the government must have known it left the commodities market unregulated – I stopped here – aka T Boone Pickens and natural gas – they could do this all – ahh – I did get off place and I coughed and passed gas as I realized it – it's odd first of all how I stop in writing just before making a point nad get distracted – high mom -  getting way off thought and into another write the point – let me make the point – it almost might be that politicians and lawmakers leave “Some goods out for theft” on purpose – yawning as I write that – like one way to find out how criminal people are is to leave them something to take – yawning again – no one could have spotted loopholes made with enron even though they made the loopholes-  like CA legislators who profitted – got into office on the power supply mess in CA – they didn't follow through and close loopholes? - that big investigation into CA not having sufficient power to meet demand causing the crazy prices – touching thumbs and coughing – and that did not get politicians in the West at least looking seriously at what laws allowed enron to do that? - Odd fairly big detail to miss for the people that would have been lobbied for the change- very short memories there.  Hmmmm  - oh well – whole lotta speculatin' goin' on – coughing here – and next is the power supply for homes – that is the next thing they want to spike.

A good segue way into the singer  in haiti – who “made something of himself”  - songs like don;t have to be a billionairre to reach the moon – it is not innovative musically – and I wouldn't expect it to be – most popular songs aren't – in addition though it hits no substance – no practical way to acheive dreams  - doesn't urge people on a course to acheive dreams – and has no other commentary to it – now that standard would kill a lot of songbirds – many pop singers can be accussed of making derivative themed songs – they sell -  but this guy is really popular and I am saying he isn't saying that much.  - getting into an infinfinite  loop and pulling out of it making me first rest my forehad on on my righx index knuckle and then rub it on it ina circular pattern – perhaps a swirl in actuality – an odd subconcious thing to do.  Passed gas right there – hi mom – but the singer has grammies and this and that suggesting certain people are on his side – I want to keep this short- what did the Nazi party offer youth when it started like – something like food, bread, education – no actual industry not under Nazi control because of course that would delude Nazi power – you get them all working for the organization – AND – the cool part- you kill off or ensure there is no industry other than yours so that everyone is desperate and the only way to succeed is to join your organization so that you have control of all the people and how much they make and what they know – but he's so generous – and it leads to the other fun question – is what is happnening in Haiti a trail run for here? - and other places – let's use Haiti as a test ground in how to found a totalitarian state – NEATO RINO  - what neat experiments people are doing right now.  Iusn't it NEAT and COOL – how to starve a nation and buy out its industries to totally control its population by Bill Gates and warren Buffet – oops I don;t see their name on the title  . . . . . .. just yet.  Can worrying about insurance induce mental illness – insurance may give you peace of mind, but the didfferent options and being so concerned about your coverage and maybe having dellusions of a talking geco – I wonder if that could cause mental illness too – I have to admit that one is a stretch – cause there is nothing corrupt about the profits of the insurance industry where coverage is andated by law in many cases.   

I hd a note – ah the newshour – the only economist who knew what was right came from San francisco – and the ecnomists were partying in San Francisco as the meltdown occurred and they said little – like the global warming crew madea  big stink – mybe osme said something – but apparently not much was said. 


I do remember – for some reason – I always thought I wasn't doing the right thing, that things weren't going right – I didn't know what was happening to me, I cn say now possibly with good reason, but I wanted to say – I remember having turned 29 and getting off the bus going to my parents home – I have to walk about a mile – down the street I grew up cross a couple streams running by the raod – but I remember thinking – dam – I'm 29, I'm not dead yet, whatever else I did wrong or whatever – I'm 29 and I'm not dead so it can't be all bad, like if I am so unsuccessful than why am I still alive.  It was odd to find joy that way, that was one of the first times, but there was joy in that thought – that maybe I hadn't screwed everything up – maybe some part of it was done right – maybe there is something to be joyful in getting older and there should be – yet Mr rooney is right that most people are angry about a life that passed thme by and at their current pains instead joyful about having gotten something out of it all.  People are more bitter than I ever dreamed and for so little reason.  I know that now – it is – but I will be 35 this time if that happens-  if not I made 34 and it is greater 29 and I do not feel the time was wasted – I can live and die with that.  You probably hear the best bedtime stories at those hours you go to sleep

What is wrong with waiting a few years and keeping our oil for ourself – kind of do you think we should live at the expense of others or is it one world – for now there is not too much wrong with waiting a few years – but the strategy of using their oil so we are the onely ones left with oil – and we can live and let them die – it would be better to try to solve energy needs together – it isn't going to work to keep oil for just us and let everyone else starve- that may make sense from a direct look at self interest – that is the strategy that leads to being Israel – with the bombs and rockets from Hamaz – we can fend them off- yes and so can Israel – it can fend off the bombs-  but it just looks like joy and a half to have to live that way – so why do that – plant the potato – don't eat it – that's why – you don;t accept that – you want to eat the potato – keep our oil for us – but that will foment terrorism – best to figure out how to save everyone – nto just us- it is doable – more than likely – maybe we need to stop holding innovation back -  I could mail a certain governor more often – I usually just respond to one thing – hmm

the environmental regulations prevent us using our own oil – hmmm – interesting – who though that one up.  

small banks made the loans Ben – the home loans – I thought that was mroe a policy for the sub-prime loans only of larger banks – maybe yo uknow that. 

Oikl is Good – Aparently that Needs to be Said 
we need to protect our selves from being vulnerable to foreign oil – isn't that the point of the strategic petroleum reserve – in addition – Russia wants the revenue as does the middle east – it is in their interest to ensure a decent oil supply so that we keep buying oil – they don't want to interrupt our supply if we are trading with them – if they hurt us – we impoversih them – it is an equal deal – it also gives us good faith incentive to treat them well – one would say oil is a perfect deal – it is a dterrant to middle east terrorism of US and a deterrent US aggression – oddly the Obama plan to redistribute wealth to other countries and turn off in 10 years as Al gore asked does not reduce or give incentive not to terrorize or the reason people will not terrorize is that they will be begging.  - we clearly could use some other power source OR develop our own technology to pump our own oil IF the middle east were terribly troublesome – oil is good.

Sorry it took an hour for the gym reference to sink in – the kids and their codes. 

Watching a 700 lb women lose 170 lbs is a TV show ??!! - bye Allen -

the gyms are full – hmm – are fat people happier than thin people – fat or thin is not necessarily due to how much you eat -

“nobody is above the law” - Obama – meaning perhaps – I should not get a pass and he has a definition to prosecute 

“the one thing that stayed intact in my administration is the constitution”- president Bush – a swipe at Obama- for like not being legally qualified to be President by his citizenship and his small detail issue of overlooking his followers who have violated tons of people's rights under the constitution – but they are his boyss n girls and they appear above the law in the coming Obama administration – If there is one – Bush has 9 days to do something yet.

Bob – tartansville – not muslims against jews in Israel – muslims against world -  as sec of state caller would support good and oppose evil – I don't believe in Christian or good or evil at this point – boy we would havwe short conversations.  - next

Molly – younger brother with very erradic behavior – has job but lost friendships – party for wedding anniversary – My parents never had a big wedding anniversary – I was not expectedto plan it – it never even came up – it just wasn't done – caller makes point that brother is not Christian – host asking about her though. - the guy  at CCAC gym – used to use this reference – call me younger brother as a code word – I didn't get that – host made inference to gym  later in show – I've lost friends – I have less supporters – yes and how much pressure were they under.

circa history – bat out of hell goes to heaven – kfyo – the bomber who became Christian – 18:47 EST – convertain Japanese captain to Japanese preacher eventually – that would be a way to learn about us – blind faith yes we can

I may be the immayture one here – pact to stay in touch – caller doesn't have wife and kids – sent email – if this is my kind of family – I don't want a famly like this – family memeber thinks he needs counselling – this is dirty – H storong fiath life- caller John – Clearwater  FL -

Caller Matt - collateral dmage with mother – she has arthriitis – get words of wisdom from priest – I'm catholic  - Matt  0-  I am not currently – or I do not practice as I do not believe in the bible as truth or in Jesus as divine – Jesus is not the Universe – nor is the christian god – I gave up catholicism – caller hurt mother- but she's mom – in my case she may have tried to kill several times throughout my life – but that will never been proven one way or another-

my parents weren't at 2 of or 3 of my college graduation – though i was only in part of 1 of those – and they split real fast out of my CMU graduation – never understood that – they did not want to meet anyone.  Now things make more sense – thatr professor – the one was trhere – he would not go inside- he stayed outside away from me – not totally surprising – it has more meaning now. 

18:30 EST
will – son – father's wishes – sister got everything -  half brothers want to sue -    In my family my father feels my aunt stole 1 million dolalrs I was looking into taking that up – the will gave property to my aunt's husband – my grandmother may not have wanted that – because she was angry at his family – and father kept saying that may be against her wishes – in other words-  my aunt rewrote my grandmother's will to favor her -  and took away 1 million out of 2 milion or under 3 million of an estate from my father – they were the main heirs – my father decided not to confront my sister – it still isn;t right if it is not what grandmother intended – and it probably isn't – grandmother wanted father to leave(read) the will – she can't read english – my aunt changed the will at her request  to include the grandchildren differently – but she coudln't read it and she could not find the will – the heart attack that killed may have been because of my aunt's wil changes -  and yes I am the blood recipeint – mother is the wife -  but with father dead – I am the blood – I gave up looking into it- but it is there.  And I don;t know if it is in her handwriting or not – in NJ – I AM sure like Dad's will which - “other people seemed to know what'd I 'd get better than I did- before I saw the will” - the military whomever knew I would get $20,000 – there is inheritance coming perhaps from Germany too – mother is trying to get ahold of – it seems delayed - - I haven't inquired – you all could get me out here in a million if you wanted and you are using things to your ends.  - initially the estate was divided evenly between them.   Up until just before she died.  - this is in NJ

Bad Internet Day  18:19 Est – internet back up – right after I finished eating – they won't let me use the dinner time to like soak information online.  1/11/09- that pattern has been there severaltiems. 
silence on O'Reilly – FOX – issue with videos happened on hulu earlier.  
and internet service shut down again – 16:32 EST 1/11/09 2 times in one day – so bugs and then I turned my computer and modem off and it initiated another shutdown of any internet service – I cannot get it back until it is replaced at station. 

It's a first to have internet service go out so often – punishment for not accepting being tagged – the having to reboot firefox tags my computer – turning off computer and rebooting modem breaksthe tag and they don't want me doing that.  - Or that is my guess – turning off the computer should not corrupt the internet connection.  - The military picture in the mock dress rehearsal for the swearing in -

Wzard's of the Caost – no acronym unlike TSR – typing would prefer it – but I can see why not – any rate – Spelljammer wans't terrible at first – but people got corny – the planet named G'Neva – and yeah that whole illithid thing – where it revolved around Demons and Devils duking it out – the writing on that smelled-  the plot wasn't well woven into the rest of the game – letting planes into the abyss appear in space – it's hack and slash plot style – which Gygax hated - - gmae balance disturbed with that – events like that – change a campaign – and I guess with spelljammer – that happened too easily – nbut if you controlled a little and made certain planets space friendly and others less visited – it could have been done – but yes – having spell-jamming actually should have had profound effects on all campaign  settings – the cultural impact was never addressed well – but you got corny for the first time and the fantasy world became slapstick – Krynnish were cool and they funny in the context of Dragonlance and it didn't blow up the game world – planets named G'Neeva do – it's not a realistic fanstasy – and you can do comedy – WG7 – isn't – the adventure into castle greyhawk – and like the random monster generator and there are 10 levels and every one is comical sometimes even political commentary – but it is a standalone module – doesn't disrupt the game balance or a campaign flow.   But yes if you're nto going to “reveiw” - the combat and spell casting and the feats and prestige and other classes which now fill several encyclopedia's when they used to fill 100 pages alltogether at best- part of the older player's handbooks – if you won't review I would like to write a new game system – D & D like – but wiht vastly different mechanics – and I can if need be create my own spells. Monsters, and worlds so I do not infringe in any copyrights – but the work may be freeware – I want control of the logo or the ability to brand the book as an official book – I don;t have full time to really publish – if you won't make your rule system work better like it used to – I want a crack at it.   I'm not Gary Gygax – but I might be able to write good game anyway.

1/11/09 15:17 EST – it helps to have your modem on when sending email – otherwise you get told the attempt failed and suspect hacker error. 

error window - not able to add a new contact - when I wans't adding one - that error window popped up - asking if I would like to cancel or retry - do they use stuff like that in infinite loop attacks and like repeat a quesiton like that over and over to disrupt the email system - I can see how that would work. 

I do look older than certain FOX television hosts did when 34 - they were innocent kids - one was-  not a bad thing to have that - but my appearance is more aged than that now - at one point I was kind of like and I still would not be still enough for TV.   Someone else - the years have been good to you in honesty. 

Not Quite "Yo B What's up My Nigga," - But a Good Discussion all the Same
If it Makes You Feel Better Or ANY OTHER REASON, Please Call Me a Nazi  - OR – The Grinch Wasn't Invented in England
Perhaps I am a Jewish Acting Commentator as Well
as I guess I will rush to someones defense and I know little – but can see what I see – I put in the term jewish acting before as sort of a play on gay-acting – a term used i ndating – actually – striaght acting – gay is used in debated – WBEZ – Ira Glass did a show on it – I actually haven;t seen it in print – I don't read the singles ads much.  - I don;t precisely know what that would mean – jewish acting – ti does make sense in the context I used it in a way – and was not meant to be derogatory – actually it was in context – but not for being jewish – but jewish wannabe – which isn;t really fair – but for various reasons in comparison with others should make sense on one level – it was not as well welded to the situation as other analogies – but I have my reasons for sticking it in there – not a s fully thought out as they could be – but not really regretting it -
you should be concerned about the sensitivity of others – in times past I would say yes – but in the context here – I will say TOO DAMN BAD
I guess it is time for a discussion on this – I have had time to contemplate this and how serious it is to get into condemning jews and using nigger and Kike or dike isn't it – Fag – one school of thought is too worry about everytime one says something and purify one's speech and think carefully about every word – sort of what the President and the Queen have to go through and yes in certain position – there is an impact if one's words SINCERELY offend – wasn;t it president in that IL town – I went there part of Chicago – I used to think as stereotypical Chicago on the west – it's not coming atthis minute – holidaysburgh- no – that's Pa – like wilmet or winnetka – but those are north – I had to look it up – Naperville isn;t it where a stray mike was on and a president candidate in 2000 called some reporter a fing asshole or something like that-  isn't he president right now? - Anyway I digress – some people are sincerely offended and do get bent out of shape-  others use that as a form of blackmail to political officials – I have wondered and kind of beleive – instead of worrying about how you express yourself – as much as is possible in scoiety – do not censor every word and let the sincerity of intent be there – to me it is much worse if you feel I am a Nazi versus calling me a Nazi – that doesn't bother me that much and I think if people got more used to expressing themselves versus hiding feeling – so for example you don't find out at age 32 or so that the city you were living in for the last 10 years actually hate your guts and wants to suck out your brain . 
With more use racial slurs and terms dull in power and meaning – there is a difference beetween HOWEVER, encouraging their use and just not making it a big deal if one is used.  I am not ivniting them to be standard vocabulary – but let them exist as words – suppressing seems to have done the prohibition thing really – whtie and black tensions are extremely high – that does not mean the current President of the United States need to address the Apparently President election – “yo what's up my nigga.”  And the worst of “term sensitivity” - is that like – you can't answer honestly – you have to step all over yourself not to use a word – you look like a Iraq-head – yes this whole little topic started after seeing the clip of Prince harry – offending the nation with his racial slurs-  and my column might be better – I honestly couldn't hear the word in the clip – like I tried twice-  clip was a little hard too – suddenly stopping in process -but even when it was running the second time I tried-  I could hear the first offesnive remark well enough to discern a word from it – but if you think I look like a skin  head then you should have the right to say that – that includes saying it in general populace – the sicnere person – I stopped the story after the first person who declared people in normal positions get repirmanded for this – um from what I understand not every US Marine gets reprimanded for a comment like that- and not for worse comments than that- but is that a poor example – yes and no – n oin the case of people I know – comments shouldn't get made – and their comments are more like – “yeah let me kill some Arabs” - very(versus) describing a helmet – as an Iraq-head or whatever it was -  I don;t think the best way to handle it is to outlaw it – but people who the comments are made about get uncomfortable – true – known from experience – very poignant experience at DAM – management should watch that – and is somewhat responsible – which is once a while checking the feeling – do you really mean that – change the attitude, nto the comment – I worry more about the prejudice than the offesnive words – someone can threaten with public children's programming – so what words are available for the threat aren't so crucial – the will to threaten is the bigger issue – the pricne wasn;t trying to go after a person – and the indian I guess gentlemen – don;t know for usre-  could be Arab or Persian – who sincerely said – who he has to be sanctioned – no  - but the indian or whichever nationality – gentleman – is free to say- hey that makes me uncomfortable please stop -  walking on eggshells doesn't end racism – that is the US lesson I feel – in many ways it has just intensified – it – because of the repressed anger at people that you can't say openly – I am not so much for word suprression if it became an office issue – maybe a talk is needed about why that opinion may not be valid – or how two people who are different can work together – banning words – doesn't solve issues – the feelings are left – it's not best to do it uncontrollably – but offical like reprimand for two words not at a person  -liek he isn't going after a person-  don;t put the Prince in a Verbal straight jacket – ti just isn't him – the english are supposed to have the heart of lions – the Grinch wasn't invented in england.  After the first sincere comment about how other employees would be disciplined for that- IT DEPENDS ON THE WORKPLACE – but I did stop the video and was going into banging head against wall mode. 

DAM kept a scent free workplace-  because of person who was allergic to perfume – my 7th grade teacher social studies was allergic to perfum – in DAM it was a former nurse – is there something about a natural scent – I know smells can be used to communicate or intimidate – someone walking in the store with beer on their breath – the smoky smell left in the book I got several weeks -back – I covered it up.  

Allan Watz- honesty – said above – and I touched upper right forearm with left pinky as I decided to comment out – finish the comment on this – I feel it is better for people to get out their feelings and issues with people much of the time – versus encourage people to hold their issues in.  There are exceptions – or sometiems there are too many issues to resolve all at once – still letting a few out nd diffusing a little is better than the buildup in the US which resulted in the 2008 election.  - touched thumbs – twice – as I wrote that. 


http://www.yahoo.com/ - menat(meant)  ot(to) go to amazon – saw the headline for football - “Playoff Officiating bludner” - a mistype error on my part – I watch those – 14:08 Est 1/11/09- head pressure as I write that down. 

1/11/09 – yahoo weather
13:53 EST 55 D and cloudy in Rocky mount – but it close to the VA border
13:55 EST 55 D and cloudy in Greenville NC north  and inland a ways
13:56 EST 54 D and cloudy in Raliegh – inland
13:54 EST 60 D and cloudy in Havelock
13:55 EST 59 D and cloudy in Kinston
13:51 EST 61 D and  cloudy in New Bern – rubbing right ear with right middle finger as I realize this means they are using the local cold spot tag trick – EI and near towns colder than anyone – New bern should be as cold it is eat and north
13:50  EST 57 D and cloudy in Morehead city
13:49  EST 57 D and cloudy in Atlantic Beach
13:45 59  D and mostly cloudy in emerald isle – mail – no it is cloudy – no break in cloudys and slightly drizzling or just did
coughing as I added above it was the mail view where it says mostly cloudy – with the partly cloudy graphic – there is a mostly cloudy graphic -
13:47 EST 57 D and cloudy in emerald ilse – general
14:02 EST 61 D and cloudy in Maysville  - which is inland about northwest of emerald Isle

13:57 EST 63 D and cloudy in Wilmington NC
13:58 EST 68 D and cloudy in Myrtle Beach SC

so my town is in the center of a cold pocket on the coastline – is it colder inland or on the coast in general on the Atlantic? - I remember CT  and the shoreline and where snow changed to rain much of the year – the coast where I am is colder than the inland.  - it's winter – hmmm  - spring that may happen – cold water to cool – but not so much now. 

Allow same use of content – BUT keep branding different – yes that might work. 

Pirateology - If the ACLU Wrote Dungeons and Dragons – Actually it Might Have Been Doing That
As a a truck – pickup truck rolls by on the beach 1/11/09 – 12:20 EST – - AN Experiment in Open Source – internet came back about this time.  12:20 EST -
I shoulde read things over more carefully and I may consult a relatively old book that I ahve from 1990s – I was reading a bunch of the books I “purchased” online and from the amazon description, they look fine – but the Wizards of the Coast formerly TSR – went in the direction of open source – which for Dungeons and Dragons makes a lot of sense – Dragon Magazine and there are others – but that was the first that I know of – had infinite articles by fans on different ideas for improving the game – some of which were adopted over the years.  There is limited room in Dragon Magazine – it seems very feasible that if fans want to write up things and contribute to the game and enhance – do not let the size of a monthly publication stop – mother just was up here and opened a door – so the Wizards of the Caost went open source it appears – so that other people besides the Wizards of the Coast could publish  game material and this is a good example of how open source – people do do some work freely and willingly and make improvements to existing things without necessarily getting fully paid or compensated by the current system.  However someone was watching and yes we are all supposed to have ethics, but I think you can guess what I will add.  There is a company in MN – that is publishing crap – the ocvers are glossy some of the artwork is okay, it looks like a sincere try.  But when you read what they do with some understanding, you see that -the door is bumping, my door – when you read what they are writing with some understanding – it looks like an assault on basic game ideas and creativity – it is hard to – they are inessence trying to get someone to buy a good looking product take it home and be disappointed and write the product in a way such that at first glance it appears to ocntriubte to the game, but in fact may be meant to take away from the game.  I know the earlier of the person who made the d20 system – he was in the company right after Gary Gygax or close to and has many 1st and 2nd edition credits to his name I would bet if I looked – I know he was around for I believe of those, open source is a good idea, but he did not count on people publishing stuff with the d20 logo to certify it is Dungeons and Dragons and basically try to corrupt and destroy the game – idssuade users from using the game- by making it seem banal – impractical and stupid.  And that seems the intent of certain books I just looked at.  It is kind of like poltiical party writing a Dungeons aqnd Dragons book – trying to stay in the rules and in the basic format, but subtly trying to corrupt the game. 
Examples.  Seafarer's Handbook – they give all of the undersea cteatures ships – like huan ships – which is similar to a theme from Spelljammer – a series from the 1st and 2nd edition – It Doesn't fit – it makes the races banal – it's hard to explain – like gary talks of tritions riding giant sea horses into battle and saughin – water breathing sort of hobgoblins – they are friends with sharks – module U3 – among other references.  In here they have a ship.  As do the tritons and the ships – tritons are essentially water breathing human male and female mermaids – but the ships are based on a human design – and it is like putting spelljammer in the sea.  There are big issues with that – this is hard to explain to someone without the proper reference.   When Spelljammer introduced ships and spacefaring – it breaks many of laws of physics and decided to change them – it made a whole new set of laws of physics for space to make space exploring by medieval fantastics societies possible – the basic idea was kind of neat – but the ships came from an alien race of sorts, ne ver fully defined, while some bbeings a race went into space, it was made clear that not all  beings hadf the technological know how to build ships and go into space – so that you could have tribal orcs on planets, yet have nefarious orcs building and maintain navies in space.   WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT SPELLJAMMER INTO ANY SEA OF ANY WORLD AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS GENERICALLY THERE IS A KE3Y DIFFERENCE – THE RACES LOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND UNIQUE TRAITS – the whole way it seemed to be designed was that like certain sea races – there are reasons they are not dominant – while humans are other creatures are – certain kuo-toa with their monitors-  they are fish men essentially and their population is going insane frequently and there is a specific description of the perosn in a tpyical tribe charged with monitoring the sanity of the other members.  But the differenct creatures in the sea are not copies of humans and elves and the rest and by giving them equivalent ships you suggest everyone is all equal and there aren't many differences.  I nhonesty the corruption may have started with spelljammer although that was nto the original intent of the series.  - But it has branched out now, and it is to make – to push out coherency and meaning – PIRATEOLOGY – fake knowledge – in this case fake fantasy – spinoffs and generic plot lines and this and that.   Eberoon – they put a subway in Eberron – it could be cool – sort of an orient express in a medieval world – and much of the rest of it is somewhat interesting.   But Gary Gygax was not – he is different from what's her name – Harry Potter – her name is escaping me – and I will think of it – coughing – they try to make it where I don't remember-  but I know they do it – I know I know her name and they are suppressing it – mother is at work it appears – that's why i was focusing on the first name and I don't know it well – J.K. Rowling – but I couldn't think of it for 5 minutes or so – had to look at last name – but Gary was more like her- in his way Daoud's Wondrous Lantorn – S4 – pretty sure that is him – it feels like him – ti si not that his tricky puzzling almost irritating nautre need reamin as the source of the game – buy certainly the strength of a well -thought out place should remain in the game – versus derivative writing – and it seems that certain people are putting out derivative writing on purpose so that people's experiencde with the game is negative and it is like trying to destroy the game by coopting – sort of Paranoia role Playing game plot – but Dungeons and Dragons isn't Paranoia and this is not funny.   - I really would like to write syste mafter this – they were trying hard to block me from writing yesterday – finishind conceptual work on a new sepll system and integrating with a new experience system and I had thoughts on integrating fighting with that.   Nad psionics or metnal abilities.  I already ahve a first draft of much of it – but I did see room for improvement – so it is not by accident – that this chaos came about – the core books – and my “friends” seem to be withholding the manual of the planes I order -version 3.0 or 3.5 – which is not 4.0 or fourth edition – and I may like that – like I liked other things – someone tried to murder dungeons and dragons – ACLU style – like the Seafarers handbook does apply real world physics and has a few stats here and there-  but the connections and playability and what is written up and what is not – it's not a good book and winds up being derivative with some useful information,  but mostly Pirateology it detracts from others parks of the game  - compare this book and it's small foray into the underdark – subtarranean races and the forgotten realms underdark book – titled, “Underdark” - to get a difference in flavor and that is forgotten Realms and is official.   Physics when put into the game is still supposed to be playable – like complaints of physics with armor – and little rules were made to adjust how well heavy armour works with characters of high desterity – there is too much thinking and physics – or the physics is used to corrupt playability and I wonder if it is done with intent – CERTAINLY THE PRESTIGE CLASSES ALL OVER THE DARN PLACE – there 100 different classes or more now – there used to be 6 – actually 8 in the very first editions – and in Advanced – clerci, druid, magic-user, illusionist, fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin, thief, and monk - 2nd edition stripped down – fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Priest – with more options to customize those - 3rd edition went hog wild – and it seems no longer to be accidental – and very quickly it gets much harder to understand – there is no longer a basic and reliable set of guidebooks to explain things to you – you need more books – at first good for business – but it is insane – unless you have this specific guidebook – you have no idea what a silver pyromancer is – and the names are in that warcraft thing – they are unqiue names – but Gary had it so like a fire ball was a ball of fire – a magic missle was missle of magical energy – maybe more than one – there were specialty spells – Leomund's Secret chest – and the Bigby's grapsing , itnerposing , etc hadn spells – but the names were logical and descriptive-  NOW – in 4th edtion and it starts in third – none of the names say enough – you can;lt understand the spell by the logic in the name – and now they added – fighter spells – they don't call them spells – but abilities on ability cards  - like spells – fighters were relatively simple in the past – attacks per round – modifiers to attack and defense – and a couple tricks – and they completely redid that in fourth edtion with all these abilities that are much harder to decipher – the whole game is much harder to decipher than it's original inception and that seems intentional.   For spells it is like  Shielding Smite and Staggering Smite  Winter's Wrath , Cloud of Daggers – there is always some confusion in spell names – but it is much harder to understand the basic of what spells do at first glance – becasue they are all attack spells mof middling strength – b4efore there would be one or two spells of some elemental attack and the rest would be fly or clarivoyance – the range of things you could do was increased – and it was easier to pick out the attack spells and recollect how much damage or what each one did – this is a confusing mess – and ytes I know I whined to myself before that – shoulodn't there be an acid equivalent to a fireball or an ice equivalent – because some mage will be fighting fire giants and fireballs aren't as useful there – and because of things that there have been more spells – but if you make more spells – even with the names there are ways to organized that – it is true if I were younger I would spend more time figuring out and memorizing each of the definitions versus now I want it to make more sense at first glance0-  nonetheless the first edtions had similar number of spells and you could skim the list better and figure out what they did versus now – definitions are essential and now – every class essentially has spells so every class needs to do the memorizing before just half or less of them did.  Complicating the game – actually making it harder to play.   Again it is like the ACLU wrote the dungeons and dragons's book it is fairly insideous.    13:26 EST 1/11/09  - this seems a trite issue – it is a means of controlling society – a good case study at how to do it-  and how to destroy something – by coopting it – and the point is to get rid of the myth writers of the game that preach a message counter in many ways to what is on TV.   - it might be a jet plane I hear very faintly in the background – commercial – small plane.   - Ah my door jiggled.  13:29 Est 1/11/09

After the mistype of hulu.com – I didn't like that so I turned off the modem and the computer to go back into the “cloaked” mode for the klingon hamster 9:23 EST – it appears the internet – the service provider went offline – that does happen – this is the third time in a month or two and now is moving to a frequent occurrence – it happens a lot if I shut down the modem and try to cloak myself to other internet users after it looks like someone is detecting me – it is their way of punishing a hamsrter for trying to stay anonymous oh what is a poor hamster to do with his goblin issues – coughing as I stop touching bed corner – she can use that to detect me.

coughing as I think this one up – ever think your hsaved head had a chessboard put on it – and there were these two gnomes playing chess on your head and they were busily involved in their game – but it was making quite a racket up there and the pieces were being moved about and at times as the gnomes got into fist fights over chess rules on different occassions – coughing up a storm with phlegm – Well the gnomes were making as rucus on your head while playing chess on it and it was affecting what was in your head, but when you asked the gnomes to keep it down both of them said - “shhh we can't think and plot so well with you disturbing the chess game.” And somehow you knew you weren't going to get much peace and quiet for days while thse gnomes were at play.     NOT THAT THAT RELATES TO ANY CURRENT SITUATION, BUT . . . . ...

non-proft - child abuse may be a problem - also on campyuses - female rape centers I bet are non-profit

Keep mixing up central and eastern time so I hit the show 11 minutes late. 
Rex andrew and the CYS person - though it is a non-profit -  (so records are not public records of these cases - not necessarily as tightly bound to privacy – sneezed and coughed as I added that) -  the interviewee – gave bed wetting, does notwant to be around a person they used to want to be around, and bruises as signs of child abuse.  - I have all 3 oddly enough – or have had recently – with any adult calling about child abuse, and teachers and counsellors doing the calls-  i would bet that is a great mechanism to take away a child from a family and there would be nothing that could be done about it -
Because child abuse may happen and I did not get to hear the numbers – but it sounds like this will be sued to push sex education at an early age – she said 3rd grade for yellow dino - - because yellow dino oddly “helped” the one child when a stranger tried to abduct them – which could have been set up – why did the stranger fail.

The fact that they raise money for child advocacy througbh superbowl parties selling beer and even booze  as well as other things – I would wonder almost if some of the people going to the party amy not do the child abuse, in any event not the “best thing” to promote – you do have alcohol and why raise the money that way – a fundraiser where you pay to have good time at a football gamde? – ho ho  –so you enjoy the beer and junkfood and large TV's and call it a charity event – interesting -  she mentioned Friday night lights – the popular show of the South and a football which apparently has swayed many to football – I only  watched a little and gave it a 3 on netflix – but it might have appeal – it still has that no tolerance sort of have to win thing in it – No – thecoach as I recollect comes off as a disciplinarian – to me football is not really the right thing to be disciplined about – discipline can be shown in other skills with a greater social function. 

Case goes to court there is immense stress for the family – which I am sort of going through – but I don;t what is going on – but having a trail like this is a nice way to like go at somone – induce stress and allow a gremlin to getsomeone to do something else -

she seemed creepy to me – her voice – and the football – and probably pushing sex ed ata young age which she will argue is necessary – how about this does the sex education part actually prevent the abuse – would a second grader or third grader – age 7 and 8 really recognize sexual abuse – can you  cover needed material for sexual abuse without going into sex – especially for very young children – definitely people who you could turn to if there was a problem or you felt unsafe and your parents couldn't help you – you could do it indirect for a couple years – and that migth be enough – without saying mommy and daddy and prevent(private) parts – it would be ice(nice) in time just to discuss sexual reproduction statically around the time other bodily functions are discussed – maybe with a mention that it should only be adults engaging in sex – but don't go into everything else -  OR maybe do it a lot differently – instead of having an awkward discussion – you can talk to a 2 year old – they want to talk to you – maybe it is us who are nto trusting the child enough -  we want to preserve child innocence -maybe it is better to not get graphic but say and talk about the consequencies of pregnancy a little and if you have to explain it – focus on all of it – not just – playing with how to aboid an issue but get into yes 2 people can conceive a child – usually you wait until your 18 and there are reasons why – a child costs a lot of money and adults are much better prepared to handle that.  And show how teen pregnancy can be dealth – that you can't conceive until you're older – that is an important issue – to know – for them – this can't happen right now – but because it does take a lot of time it is best to wait on haivng children.   - The issue is – if there is sex ed in elementary – it is covered in a neutral way – and I guess I either want-  give them numbers to call if there is a problem – AND if a young child has questions – then explain everything so they understand.  Maybe asking a few questions first-  more of a all in or all out – the issue is slightly explaining – rubbing forehead and right eye with right wrist as I say that – parents are embarassed to talk about sex – that is a cultural thing but the games are played with that embarrassment – and I wanted to say something slightly different and forgot it.  Ah – we say a kid won't understand – most of the time – it seems like we don't explain – and I know in my dealing parents don't want to admit their faults.  Not just biological parents.   Best protection is knowledge. 

she not use college interns – the therapy – and rotating college interns who provide therapy and then HAVE THE INFORMATION of who got sexually abused – that can tghen get out to someone – using interns for the therapy for direct cotnact versus long term staff – problem there – in case the confidentiality didn't QUITE get respected. 

I did  hear the part about a Gaza family suffering and an Israeli family suffering because of all this.

Barack Obama “If Someone is shooting missles into my daughter's bedroom I will do everything that I can to take care of it” - he didn't have to personalize the reference – it has come up in the past that if he goes after me – Leona helmsley lost her son – only son in an odd accidence and one might interpret – went down below – one might interpret that as a punishment from God.   It does seem to happen – someone was trying to draw me in to other comments now which would be truthful – but we are playing the legal game and not concerned with truth.   There are penalties for abusing power – you can see that throughout history and God intends to make those stick. 

A Newcomer's Guide to the Bible by M Armour 0899008593  and WWII US Army Normandy Armor Guide Tank Info Photos Etc – search for   armor guide – I was looking for a very different book from a role playing game. On ebay. 

kfyo - shots killed 5 in audience in a basketball game in Chicago - use it to band guns - um certain people salivate at the idea of my getting addictged to nicotine - because they did try to get me a smoking habbit - not a cigar habit - but like I found a pack of half finished cigarettes at a stressful time by my feet - some in the pack unused - clean - no dirty cigarettes - pack was open with unused cigarettes in it - on Forbes avenue by court house - corner closer to downtown but away from bus stop - in Pittsburgh - they wanted to get me a smoking habit.  - I know rush smoke cigars - I could get them - it's not something I need.  - and I don;t really want it - it is not practical - but i could try it - I tried a baseball game.   22:07 EST 1/10/09 - but be careful with an addiction - I do not need that- they are trying to frighten me from even trying - we again have to thread the needle tight and not live(leave) give - what - I know it supports sout of the border and is a product they can make - it's not really practical - I could try it - I don;t relax and I don't want to - not like that.  I t's not me - to sit and smoke - or sit and fish - it's just not me.  And I sick of being manuipulated into things - I am perfectly capable of exploring on my own - which you don't allow - I could still try it - I have tried worse things - it dances in some nasty areas- they wanna get me on drugs - and this comes up - and it smells likeyou -  we dance into the fire instead of away from it - before I understood - but you keep doing it - and at this point I would like to shore up defenses.

Cigar Dave
Josh – 2 to 3  a day cigar habbit – monte cristo to sancho panza – I tend to buy cheap -

relighting cigar-  using a cigar to start a fire – that is what you caller is getting at – when
padron 6000's- cigar – Peron  almost – caller asked about putting out a cigar and not finishing it and the nrelighting it. 

and my favorite total transformation commercial – versus the cigar commercials on the rest of the show – just before I email – cute 21:53 EST 1/10/09

just before last segment – even cigars and caillho can be threatening
quit in 1992 – I graduated high school then – 21:47 EST –caller is fishing  H speaks to not getting addicted to cigars. 

getting the host to say cuba – caller dropped he has NY rdio – suggesting listening from there – just started 3 weeks ago – new listener. 

yes dave the call is dirty – cristolbol – or crystal ball.  21:42 EST 1/10/09 – no I don't drink – there should not be chicken  - macanudo from CT – my home state – Carone meeting in Orlando – florida is not a fan – Corona – the beer company? - they are not fans either. 

Manhood with cigars – I have ben told the opposite in the past by WQED – smoking reduces sexual potentency – but yes “manhood” has been a big issue. 

I would be against a cigarette ban in a person's own car and own home even if children are present - given that medical evidence that smoking may or may not be the worst thing the parent does to the child - the parent unless an extraordinary case is there to make decisions about child's health - yes the government should not be regulating smoing in personal spaces - that is too far can the pets smoke in their houses in CA -? - the humans can't - but I bet the pets can-

kfyp - “Obama computerizing healthcare records to prevent deadly medical errors “– ho ho ho ho ho – mixing risperdal and geodone with a patient with potential issues-  highly overweight – oh Backy you're so much fun as potentially threaten my life- so we're not going to starve me to death in a mental hospital – a wrong drug - privacy with computerized health records- as I hold on placing a bid on something closing in 20 minutes on ebay

college grads weathering recession best.  Ho ho

Bud – can't smoke in house - - his wife wouldn't let him – he paid most of the mortgage – we're divorced - - wife nagged him – this almost feels like a friendly call .  - work on cars in garage – and enjoy sticks – this show still could still be a set up – didn'task wife to smoke in his own house - - a dviorce – father found a broken wedding ring on a bench outside – he mentioned it meant divorce – a week or two before he died.

r am not the biggest cigar smoker – I am not for sChip either – worried about waste in public funded healthcare – and yes cigar smokers – why are they liable for funding children's healthcare – I cannot fully say I would not support taxing cigars like  I support (taxing) prostitution – why the tax has to go from 5 cents to $1-3 a cigar – one might wonder the point of that tax – what countries- where is the cigar idnustry based?   I don;t support lots of smoking bans everywhere – like not by government mandate – smoking is probably not healthy – but why you have to force people to stop smoking is an issue with me – many things considered healthy are not so – getting rid of bread and the low carb diet craze? - I am not planning to take up smoking soon.  I heard you – the cigarette tax is a tax on the poor – and is not so nice or easy as it seems -..  The poor smoke – the wealthy tend to smoke less often as a habbit.. 

my account creation was weird in twitter  - it spun out- never stopped spinning on the submit – when I refereshed to get back to the account creation screen – said I was already logged in.     chadshow at twitter -

I didn't comment on the pain threshold of cutting out an yeyball -yes I couldn't do that either.  - possessed ? - are the gremlins that strong – there are still a few things I don't know about – aren't there – things I may not enjoy finding out – I should have known – what NEATO world we live in – child prostitutes all. 

the term honkey – my – the black kid I knew grewing up would use that term – like this other guy called him a nigger once – we were in summer camp – maybe 4h  grade – maybe younger – but a guy I didn't know well and he called the black kid nigger and the black kid responded back honkey. 

Chris Roth – did a piece on the difference between black convicts and white convicts – and black cons who murder just murdering – but white convicts mutilating their victims. 

It is nerve wracking how it feels like you want to keep – just one step away from being caught – versus safer – I should be used to it by now – I am not- why this whole business has to go on – I do not understand fully – I do get you want someone and I am the key to it – and you will push on a tight rope if it helps catch that person – that I can understand – even if it is painful.    Mother out at her jazz concert – and they scanned the place with her gone – but Ichanged things around negating their scan – nice. 

104.1 – The Truth – AZ – Laura Ingraham with Mark Stein – the foreign right wing “idiot” who is funny and stupidly supports the fascist Rush Limbaugh. 
Mark was talking with Laura about issues in Canada – and anti-semitic protests in Canada – that the jews are being referred to as “brothers of pigs – only thing Hitler did wrong with jews is he didn't do a good enough job - “ - apprently highly inflamatory stuff and that is becoming a world movement – so like we are being pushed into a new Germany stance – just the USA could be used for Germany -  using people to push anti-semitic rhetoric – will pave the way for bad actions by Arabs – making jews into victims and justifying a strike on Arab nations – it is Arab leaders and Persian leaders who will now have to try to restrain their people – it is potentially in jewish interest to push anti-semitic sentiment – IF – it leads to a backlash – if the pushing of it goads muslims and others into acts against jews – that then can be a springboard to take bigger acts against muslim nations – that may be the objective – and the anti-semitic statements are planted to stir up a crowd – it will wedge – instead of having peace with Arabs – we will declare on war on them – some jews apparently feel the best way to deal with the muslim neighbors of Israel is to get rid of them – and you have to justify it – this is one to do that – the US is poor and needs a way or could use it – a perfect way to restructure things – this is a bit much to believe – OTHER THAN – Mark Levin mentioned the muslim protesting group by the UN – and they were saying to “stick jews in the ovens” - and that comment was blatantly fake - - referring to Hitler – why would muslims refer to Hitler – that also sounds fake – a jewish group or allied force faking muslims who had a problme with Hitler would use Hitler- but mulsims have post-Hitler problems with jews and don't need to look at Hitler – the Hitler and WWII references from muslims – when their involvement in WWII and it's impact on the whole Arab world is not as much as other places – yes their is Palestine /Israel – BUT for the most part they had less impact than others.  Though I should read about Patton and Rommel – the other way to use the gambit is to condemn any sincere attempts at historical reckoning – along with the sentiment stirred up – they will try to push me into this group – THIS IS THE STRATEGY WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS – THE SIERRA CLUB IS USED TO DESTROY ANY SANITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT -  it's the same game – but this time used with anti-semitism -   to stop any criticism of jews – co-opt it – overdo the criticism – cause a backlash intentionally – and then push others to block the criticism – while it works – a lot of dead bodies and people get hurt when you play like that – and to someone – that doesn't matter-  it is a troubling development to hear these anti-semitic remarks and the pattern and see what is going to happen – they are trying to stire some hostility to jews in order to allow jews back into being the world victim and then get some policy passed to help the jewish community that is probably not ethical or fair – but will get passed anyway because of the sentiment generated – that may be the plan – definitely I see issues with crticism being “authentically Arab andd muslim” -  the muslim community would be well – advised to try to keep THEIR people out of this – they are potentially intended to be the victims of this – not the winners.   In any rate – using anti-semitism to deal with the jewish community is not the right way forward – exposing the truth and what is the truth is.  Exposing these son-of-a-guns who manipulate the whole system this way and like don;t care – or feel it is okay to kill everyone else so that they prosper – expose them. 

the genome stuff is not there yet – we do not understand the combinations of genes and their precise effects-  you cannot pick your kid's attributes for a while yet.  - It would be kind of nice and advantageous to insure offspring with superior traits – if you can do something like that-  it would make sense to do it – now we could get into the issue of do you need less desirable people or not – Brave new World – eventually the answer will be no – I know that point will be a fight – I can see others – their reaction now – “protect me syndrome “– defensive -  I will bet the process is not 100% effective even if it says it is – they are finding the combination of genes is improtant – not just a gene – the genetic history – tracing geneology things seems fraudulent – I bet designer children is not their yet either-  an activist group wil lstir up the pot – as they say to fundraise and stoke people's fears which si scumbag but it will be done. 


Human mole dies of thirst in trash - story from UK – ho ho ho dies of thirst because he lost his way in his trash - rotting trash and network of tunnels - - pony tailed loaner - yes that story smells in several ways. - Oh the games we play. - he 74 years old - i am born in 1974 


caller – if you don't have kids you don't pass on anything – your caller on chahasty – who said eye color is too cosmetic but get rid of diseases – 19:23 EST 1/10/09

Chad I did Micahel Phelps – advocate for psychotic drugs – mom had him on that common – ridllin ? - it did affect his brain – he is not swift – but his olympic thing will make people feel better about taking the drugs – which will destroy their minds and certain people want to stupidify the children – create vegetables – certain people want a 2 tiered society in the US and a way to do that is to destroy the smart people in the second tier-  I am not designated first tier – by whomever – and they want me out – so that – what the eexperts who are fudned by the first tier say about child development and what not – makes sense – I am a failure of public schools – and of Yale – yale thought I wasn't good enough as did all the other ivy leagues – CMU used to be a lower ranked school – where I went – and the public school system intially felt I was a slow learner  - I am not picked by the tier 1 people to be a person of significance and they have to kill or get rid of me to keep their system intact – I show that what they have been saying about who is smart and who is not might be B_LL

NOOOooooo – don;t go on twitter chad !


wow who knew – there are radio stations in NC- even online – that my linux computer can hear without paying for proprietary sound formats – but they are showing their “brotherly” love for me. 

sound not working for radio address of whitehouse.gov – almost always happens – it's corrected in that case by restarting the computer- I usually have to do it – haven't reported it – 17:24 Est 1/10/09  - upon reboot – mistype  tp://wwwhitehouse.gov/ at within a minute of the time above. 

pasted email list1 in mccain.senate.gov- 17:02 EST 1/10/09- seem to just always forget that right now. 

I was spitting up everything for half an hour when starting to design – maybe an hour – just continuously needed to spit – felt the burning in ym throat every once in a while which would motivate a new stream of saliva – it happened at the time I was trying to design part of a gaming system – Improve on something I had already done – a little head pressure as I write this – there were a few other things – but mainly spitting over and over and over – needing to spit because saliva kept coming out – this has been done before – this is the worst – the mucus is less this – due to what is inside my gullet not being at an all time low – but this was a clear attempt to prevent me from writing – and someone did come up when the spitting started to subside.  Oh happy joy – I cannot write anymore – it also suggests as something wasn't done – the government did the – I don't want to study thing a while back – for months-  they can't do that- I did want to work – but I jsut kept spitting up – and spitting up -  and had to belay a couple thoughts – but the spitting was the main thing – it might like 14:00 Est – it was 16:00 when I stopped working – I didn't do anything much for the first half hour but spit? - Interesting time.  - It had been happening early but not quite like that.  Not so intensely – I was productive despite that.

so the local cold spot trick today – seen that before. 
I was designing part of a game system when I looked

I look for a comedy by John Goodman and Roseanne Bar titled Center of the Universe – even putting in Goodman's name to the search and I get . . . . modest mouse – a semi-depressing band that I first heard in Pittsburgh in 2006 at the bookstore – and the configurations we have currently can't help putting stress on the keyboard wire.  It has the severe turn in it I was trying to avoid. 

1986 CBS – 60 minutes was #5 in the ratings – wow that's almost like american idol - #5 of CBS shows I think – no – cheer is above and that is not CBS  - NFL Monday night football was Number 18 -  coughing – that was the Reagan year – though this is currently the Bush year- we don't always improve on history.  - 60 Minutes is #6 – somehow read it – still more popular than Monday Night Football- news more improtant than football – wow – what an interesting concept – mother is doing a dance below and I had a commercial plane visit in the last 20 minutes – probably last 5 minutes 10:20 Est 1/10/09.  

If I am right about the eyeball eating prisoner – then showing a murdering prisoner who was determined to be crazy for a much lower threshold would coutner the effect of the first story.  - wiping forehead and then getting off a piece of debris off my right ring finger with my left thumb and index finger. 

FOX – the various acid trips people are on

algae for jet fuel – yes as wdonrous as it is – not only is it algae but – touched thumbs – but there was some oil from some plant in the algae portion of the jet fuel – so you have a chemcile process just to make the oil – to make the oil you have to combine two different plants – algae is a plant – normally it used to be considered a plant – today it may be considered a protist -  but anyway – biology isn;t really plants and animals when you get down to it – like the gay straight thing with earthworms each of which has both sexes – biologists have said – an animal is this and a plant is this – but in biology there is a whole spectrum of things that are “sortta animal and sorrta plant” and don;t perfectly fit either category – taxonomy has made nature seem pretty clear when it is not so really  - that is a human imposition in understanding it – that seems to lead to cultural assumptions based on a structure imposed by humans that isn;t fully naturally there – I digressed – but there is a two part process to making the basic oil and it doesn;t sound like that is gas – usable gasoline substitute just yet – in shrot they were big on making the plane fly with algae – they covered lightly – how complicated the process it is and what is involved to turn algae into gasoline – how much algae is needed to make what quqantity of gasoline – and how much energy is used into a said amount of algae into gasoline – and seeing as letter of law and not spirit always pops up in this debate – how much land is needed or volume is needed and the costs in that – and time to turn around the algae into gasoline – the whole thing – and how much that might cost – and how hard it will be to keep an algae crop pure – a divergent strain could always sneak in – unlike corn, algae start up microscopic and that is harder for a farmer to detect the problems with – (but the point is cost and actual usability of the fuel to replace oil was not mentioned – yet of course we could have ANOTHER government subsidy like wind and solar – ANYTHING to get off oil – GLOBAL WARMING DUE PRIMARILY TO FOSSIL FUEL USE IS A MYTH - )
Now the ohter part – coughing as I seperate the writing like this
– spitting up phlegm – oddly there is a bunch of algae by me – trying to grow stuff again in my room – always have trouble with plants since 2004 – though before that seemed to have a green thumb = another loiving thing – diffuses attacks – mother has several plants on her floor – and kjeeps several in the basement – my floor has a plant about 50 to 100 feet from me of hers – I never or rarely go near – so you won't confuse it's life sign with mine – every complicated plant I have grown has died – my terrarium full of mole crabs isn't it – small sand crabs died out too – thought before I could keep it – I thought I would try to grow pepper plants – simply for now – you can add complexity if the simple works – they can play with bacteria in an effort to destroy them – indeed the algae destroyed the first batch – which was all water – the gorwing algae which is simpler blocks the pepper seeds from sprouting and growing and peppers are more complicated organizisms – i wages harder to distinguish from humans – so the algae story on fox has other implications for me as well.   Watching things grow is also soothing – a way to push against the illusion that lays before me – they did several times sabotage my terrariums in Pittsburgh – the aphids that killed my pepper plants some of which bore small fruit despite my north light window in Pittsburgh -  plants also take in things like CO2 – clean the air – my air will be cleaner- can't cotnrol the  agents in my air as well.   Yes children – having gone in her room and opened her window while she was away – mother's room has a faint smell of the golden rod plants below – she is not allergic – it is pleasant – my room is on the opposite side of the house-  though thanks in large part to Mr Liobmaugh I have managed to bring in my own scents and tame any bad scents planned in my room – coughing up more phlegm – but when we get to summer again and spring – it will get hot and eventually I will let the fan go and let the A?C vents open – because we don;t use windows like I used to – and the air in the A/C may have who knows what in it – I was hoping this would be over before spring – but we will see.  Perhaps over is the wrong word – but shall we say – the temperature in this room I was hoping would not be something that concerned me very much by the coming spring. 


Like Using Strong Antiobiotic on a Flue  - Cleaning up Streets of Los Angeles is a Tricky Business When it Comes ot Finance
The issue – ti sounds well and good get rid of the businesses of the mob – coughing up phlegm and this is a very nasty story – when I tease all the little traps in it – Bee Movie of what's his face Seinfeld – yes I can tie that in – that is the argument behind this story – that type of argument – which is hogwash.   This story is setup so that if I take either side I am screwed unless I hit the whole issue and get into everything – but if I am for taking away gang finances I am end doing the wrong thing and if I am against taking away ganag finances I am doing the wrong thing – mess up either way and the second furthers the argument – that we need all US business to be run the corrupt – pseudo-capitalist way ti is and is trying to suggest honest honest capitalism cannot work – Adam Smith would say that when a business started being corrupt the system should always be strong enough to allow a new business in to supplant a corrupt one at any time- coughing up phlegm like every 5 seonds – mother is having fun apparently   
Here's the thing – you do want to take away the powerbase of a drug dealer of gang by reducing their assets – BUT – if you remove and destroy all the gantgs and all the businesses they generate – there is nothing left for the community – giving the money to the schools and the children is an insult BECAUSE the businesses you sold to get that money could have employed the children and giving them jobs – someone is trying to argue in CA – ONE OF MY FAVORITE STATES AFTER ma(ma)(MA) AND ny(NY) – someone is trying to argue – that see you need the corrupt way of doing things – you need the mob like policies of apparently microsoft and Mcdonald's because if you wipe them out – then no one will have jobs – and that is the point IF all – more phlgem – if all the mob business in Los Angeles are closed all at one – tooth pain – and my calves still hurt – been 3 days – normally would be uflly hhealed – odd that – forget to mention it twice today -  but if all the family gang businesses are taken out at once – the community will be broken or that is their fear – they feel you can alwayds have an amazon.com – a business who is low price, but actually a traitor and that business will take over if allowed to be and then jack up the prices – again see argument one – Adam Smith says that the system should be strong enough to run any business out – AND THE REASON AN AMAZON.COM DEVELOPS AND IT'S LIKE THAT WHERE THERE IS ONE BUSINESS IS BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL WHICH COULD BE ALTERED SO THAT – THE POWER IS NOT SO TOP DOWN AND ALL THE CONTRACTORS WOULD DECIDE NOT TO SUPPORT THAT MARKET IF IT BECAME CORRUPT – IT COULD BE REGULATED THAT WAY – YOU THINK ONLY IN THE FAMILY MODEL – WHERE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY CONTROLS IT ALL – BUT IT DOESN;T HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY -YOUR FEAR IS – WITH THIS NEW AGE ONE GROUP ONE BUSINESS IS THE ONLY ONE IN A MARKET – AND THAT IS TRUE – IT IS MORE LIKE THAT – THOUGH TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD NEVER JUST BE ONE – BUT YES – AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE FOR USED BOOKS – EBAY IS NOT A FULL COMPETITOR – NTO A FULL REPLACEMENT – NOR IS BORDERS NOR IS BARNES AND NOBEL.COM – CERTAIN THINGS i WANT ARE ON AMAZON OR A FEW SMALL PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE IN TIME WITH THE INTERNET – AND THE ARGUMENT IS SEE IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY WE END UP WITH AMAZON ALONE – IT GETS CORRUPT AND WE'RE SCREWED – BUT – AS YOU ARE FINDING OUT ON YOUTUBE – THE MASTER CAN BE CORRUPT THESE DAYS – YET LACK THE FULL POWER TO ERADICATE HIS ENEMIES – OR HER ENEMIES IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TRULY INDEPENDENT USERS – YOU CANNOT FULLY DESTROY THE USE OF YOUTUBE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ENEMY TERRITORY – YOUR THEORY THAT IT IS A PROBLEM IS FAILING – ** AND ** - WITH A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE IDEAS OF A FULL ONE PERSON CEO WHO CAN HAVE THE POWER TO ERADICATE A DISSIDENT IN AN ORGANIZATION  - THAT MODEL CAN CHANGE IF NEED BE – WE CAN FIND AS NEW ONE – EVEN RIGHT NOW – EVEN WITH A MOB APPROACH OF CONTROL – YOU DO NOT HAVE FULL CONTROL UNLESS YOU BREAK ALL THE RULES – AND TECHNICALLY IF YOU BREAK THE RULES – SOMEONE SHOULD STOP YOU -  more phlegm and a burning throat -  see to explain jumped there – the gang may be the center of the community-  maybe in all ethnic communities a gang was the center – and while it may have a nasty business to bring in the bucks – if the gang does not control part fo Los Angeles – without – there are no jbos or businesses in the community – and another community can take over in two minutes – corporate people for bigger restaurant chains and what not can buy out the community – so whomever is arguing – if the community does run a corrupt system – that same corrupt system is strong enough to fend off a corporate or stronger controller – and serves as a watch dog – it also of course creates inefficiency and in some cases is not allowing products in that are better that challenge its core means of survival – if a new product would displace the main profit mechanism for the community -  YET IT WORKS BETTER  - the communtiy feels it should be destroyed – yet the strongest society always wants to use better products and cannot afford a model where a better service cannot be used – I guess in truth as someone is arguing – there may be a better energy source than oil – hidden somewhere – and oil use is bad – or nto the best – that is temporary and due to disparity between third and first world – i nthe systme proposed you will never use certain ideas and thoughts and have to kill them off – because your way of doing things won't work if those ideas are implemented – there HAS TO BE corruption in the system – it has to be a gamed system with you – so you will kill off any idea that blocks the gaming of the system – almost forgot but got it back – coughing and phlegm – you  - forgot again – I will get it -  you say ah – there it is – your premise with me is I am a cockroach something that happened that shouldn't – but I oculd be a trendsetter too – in which case – there will be another me in time – and antoher and another – from “Powder” and “Phenomenom” - ron hubbard in Battlefield Earth argues for kiling off telepaths and winning by leverage – getting the dirt coercing cooperation, you scientologists are scumbags – ya hear me Terl ande your little flyboy too - it sounds like several people like me have been killed off – in the end I defeated even this argument – and to finish the refute – the other to do things – to prevent takeover from outside – is to go in and one by one turnover businesses to better management – so that there is no full vacuum in the community – that could be done too – a different form of a network could be created with a different value system – that helps people better – even partnerships with the larger entities who oculd ocme into the neighborhood – the destruction of the Los Angeles mobs could be done in a way not to destroy the whole community – but free it from a single tyrant which it has now – from a single group of oligarchs and the same could be done with the jewish mafia – and any other pwoer groups in this country who also beleive -  THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE THE PWOER BROKERS AND THEM ALONE OR SOME OUTSIDER WILL COME IN AND KILL EVERYTHING IN THE US BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BROKEN UP THE COUTNRY WILL BE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK -  NO – the breakup can be done in a slow stabilizing way – like  preserver casting spells versus a defiler – yo ugive the negative connotation because YOU are afraid of losing power – the best computer security involves a publicly visible code and features – not a secret one – for if the secret gets discovered – the whole group can be destroyed.    Art has suffered, Science has suffered – you send many innovators into loops – this suggests your way is ultimately destructive..   More and more you are blocking innovation and discovery trying to send both science and art into infinite loops or unproductive projects so they don't discover anything that could change the current playing field – YET – in the past we have depended on those changes to make things move forward.   Just itched nose- that was a mistake -what does that do – if they get you to itch a body part – they can tell where to poke later on ? - never have made that connection – the algae – they are no longer sure without seeing me what is what – necessitating more congfirmation? - that might be it. 

Al Franken – funded by Soros – Gore – and the hollywood usualy suspects – Tom Hanks, George Clooney – Martin – Akroid – missing a female in that group – no – no woman – i was wrong – but several other men – Mike Myers – Donahue – Michael J fox -  no female supporters mentioned in 10 hollywood celebrities named – kind of odd – Robin williams – could not focus on him – okay – and then – Ted Danson and mtoher is trying to get me to not rmemeber – have to keep replaying – Letterman  - John McCain's buddy – well it is certainly one way to acheive power is to have hollywood  fudn your Senatorial campaign – did I write a thing to some Georgia Senator – about how if you have all this money from out of state washing into the campaign – do you really represent your state? - wow I did – didn't I ?-  we won – we'll see what you won – just like on Make a Deal – you never know until you pick the door and the host opens it -   I get it that they want me to know by the way. 

Still thinking about how nice it is that someone in the DoD is on talk radio and telling people to kill the infidel which may well be me – the DoD which is suppsoed to protect me is trying to kill me-  NEATO !!!!

New Possible Doctor Prescirption – Prescribe Risperdal to Heal Psychosis of Cracked Liberty Bell
FOX Eating salamanders in Asia -and the dangerous animal guy – Remote Area Medical – things do have a common theme to them, don't they – by having a dnagerous animal show – where you normalize interacting with dangerous animals – show it as a challenge that is a way to encourage the public to handle dangerous animals – resting forehead on index finger joint – it is interesting that he like the cold blooded snakes – perhaps we should rap a christmas sweater around them which won't  of course help them because they are cold blooded – only warm blooded animals would a christmas sweater keep warm in a cold winter – yawning as I say that.   And yes on the next segment speaking of Christmas sweaters – salamanders came up again – i like salamanders like the little geckos that used to be around – and the little frogs – salamanders were around in CT – around the house – occassionally I tried to have a few as pets – what do salamanders eat for food – only the silverfish have been in my room for the most part.  Asian eat salamanders – I think Asians have one too many creatures on their menu and need to farm a little more and feast on other creatures a little less – touching  forehead to right index knuckle after holding right thumb with left index and forefinger – or left index finger and thumb that should be – ah now pains in my abdomen and behind and passing gas – such a next(nice) morning – but in a crisis you turn to the local community – some sortta white haired drunken-faced idiot was mumbling that – LEAVE US was the license plate I got shown in 2007 – the various incidents in this nice and “Wondrous” little complex where certain people have “helped things along” - we have our flags and our former mariens and former CIA agents.  And as they would say – it is nice 'round here- if you can't see what isn't here – like Raistlin I have cursed vision at times – sort of like seeing what the scenes in “gone with the wind” will become as the first part rolls on.   The “experiment” in my new shirt which is supposedly around here somewhere – with its moisture trapping system – my little “trek” and the “friendliness” of my neighbors – they wouldn't let me die on  the street – no siree – never happen – I rarely email my own congressman – the remaining Senator has asked to part company – I don;t blame the Senator  too much – even really the congressman – Senator Dole who did help me and comes from a very prominent Republican family – got defeated in this pinko commie state of NC – a gift from my “buddy” in NY – it's winter isn't it?  One way to increase oil price is to decrease oil supply – another is to increase demand – standard ecoomic theory – not probably part of Friedman – but then again I don;t memorize most poets and verses of the Qu'ran or Torah or bible either and I seem to grasp  things pretty okay.  The “religion” of academics – have I conveyed enough – I would think so.   More rogue foxes – tisk  tisk – Anyone who can beat my argument versus saying – we don't like you – still waiting for that person – still waiting for people to stop saying things like - “kill the infidel” - someday we might all be infidels and then you wouldn't that policy when it's your turn – you count on your turn not coming up.   “From every Mountainside, le – et Free dom Ring” - the PA is a bit cracked these days- the liberty bell – give it some risperdal – a doctor might do it.  It has much chance of helping the bell as it does me – maybe more  because it's negative side effects won't impact the liberty bell. 


1/10/09 6:40 EST heart or left chest pangs – a totally completely new way to do things. 

a certain blonde haired  FOX mentioned the hotel California-  famous song – CMU professor of mine liked it – first video I get – I think there is a computer error becuase it is silent – even 30 seconds in – find out – it is fine – just a silent video labeled, “Hotel California – the Eagles”  - there is a note on the main audio track that it has been disabled by the copyright holders and yes the video and audio appear not to be at the top of youtube searches if anywhere – you have to go to a live performance or othe venue -  a minor detail – but not completely if the graphic content of a video has additional messages in it, that all the sudden make less sense without the needed audio stream – coughing as I write that.  - but she keeps mentioning North Korea -  a fox indeed – I have enough foxes who think I'm a chicken. 

And Mark Levin keeps mentioning that he is now live in the West Coast – as if when Obama won the election and liberal left is supposedly in pwoer – he finds it a tad odd to have right wing people in San Francisco suddenly want to flock to him and hear him because for most people – the winning person is the one who is right.  Of course the San Franciscans want to hear your every word and learn from you Mark -, they're not spying on right wing talk show hosts to make sure that the people who were elected to power know every single word you say and every possible nuance it has if possible before it comes out of your mouth – our coutnry doesn't work like that- what are you talking about? 

So with this next call I can confirm people at the DoD are working against me – And the DoD may have set me up  - OH THE SANITY OF IT ALL – Question – would we be safer iof Iran got Our Nuclear weapons to protect us from our own stealing them and using them against us?  - just a question that does come up. 

Levin 1/8/08 (is that a biblical verse?)– the dod anaylst who teaches computer science in Asheville NC – jihadees mean to kill us – young people not educated – kill the infidel – standup or or something – there was something else it was lipped from – I can replay – but someone downstairs is awake I see – because things are getting ripped from my mind – I have a computer science – I am the infidel he thinks need to be killed- this is the call they blocked from earlier – Mark Levin 1/8/09 – those few minutes where my computer was down- Professor Bill – some people out there are hanging in – the rest of the crackpots need to be edcuated – I think he is referring to me – with that and others – destroy individual liberty – they do not want God to have control of things – they like the system where higher level Gremlins – get to destroy someone like me and god is putting an end to that – in his mind he and others should control the direction of the country – they want their freedom =- but at the expense of others -  he handed out pocket cConstitutions – the CCAC administrator – did the same – that does not mean it gets read.  - the doctor – doctor bill also had the quip about information warfare – something like that in his spheel – he  may be referring to Mark and rush giving information as well as others – he may also be asking them to change tactics – also not- like sometimes the message is the exact opposite of what they say – survivor – not survivor big brother -

Kirk God bless Joe- I guess  the animal caller – there's a few things that it comes down to – belief in almighty and in this country I believe – a threat to me -  21:45 EST 1/9/09 – and I didn't get the name of the last caller – this one is pointing that out as a victory perhaps – in addition – the caller's are linked – this acknowledging other callers used to be infrequent

animals don't love you in reality – they obey you. 

dog that can't swallow well and has to be put down – and has pneumonia which I think got mentioned elsewhere – new theme – I have been out of CT about 15 years – age of dog.   - dog abandoned in city – feel he is squeezing my heart – a CT caller – ho ho ho ho 

reid might be seeing if anyone cares if he doesn't seat Burris – is there any reality to public opinion.   Also makes news out of nothing – covering up other stuff going on.  No one is challenging the majority on his ability not to seat the speaker – he is able to take the authority – that may be the experiment – people anticipate ethics – not activists – Senator Reid is showing that – people in Us not used to defending our liberties when they are sneaked away. 

oiol announced cuts yesterday in workforce – now boeing – alcoa countered by oil which is countered by boeing – boeing and alcoa are adversaries – oil and gas are not. 

mother won't buy any cucumbers which do clean the body – she served a cooked zuchini tonight – but not the cucumber – something I like and she does that leaves out nutrients intentionally – it looks small – but she keeps leaving out specific things relating to what she is attacking – cucumbers help flush your system.   - it is odd of her not to but cucumbers.. 

I agree with Mark Levin about this fiscal policy not making sense – I hope the CURRENT president would not blow up the country – maybe making the US poor will teach it a lesson. 

Milton Friedman's Doctrine – mentioned on Rush Limbaugh – Raymond is the caller – Schroedinger's cat – it shouldn't come up – I didn't look it up last time.  - before 21:00 EST just before – 1/9/09 – Mark Levin

why isn't microsoft knee deep in lawsuits with shrinks – psychiatrists saying computer time is dangerous – yet mattel is – China poison toys – software has gotten a free pass and no one complains sues them for health issues yet they have money and are vulnerable – odd no one goes after it – that is odd when i think of it – it starts to seem some people get a “pass” in lawsuits and others don't – hmmmm – that GEICO gecko is demeaning to lizards Mr Buffet – it's prejudiced against reptiles – pet owner boycott GEICO cause Warren Buffet is a bigot against Geckos.   Geckoes don't actually talk.  The commercial misinforms the children. 

not a gambling man especially with someone who wants to be state senator. 

My calves have been in a great deal of pain – as I hear the advil commercial – like usually even now – I get over the walk in 2-3 days fully – it is still hard to stand up – get off the floor – not impossible – hard – harder than I expected after 2 days- I wonder if someone didn't accentuate the pain – play with the muscles – they do that. 

people who pay taxes and work – versus suckers on government teat-  farmers should not be using those words – you are nto a farmer – but audience is – how many farm subsidies are there – what is the wind farm subsidy worth? -  You “make” money-  I dopn;t cost too much. 

mistype -  Sorry, there are no results for “http://www.hannity.ciom/” passed gas as about to go there 19:30 EST – 1/9/09

Mentally ill - the data doctors have for how people work on medication is from death row inmates in part - who have  SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE TO MISLEAD ABOUT - about their mental illness - i.e. - take our meds and live or don;t and say your sane and die - I have not eaten my own eyeballs just yet - like that inmate did - that is an odd crime - van gogh cut his ear off not to hear things - I have to wonder - gremlins aren;t known to be nice - and if he is ruled mentally ill - they med him and cause him to get better by taking the images out of his head.   I was thinking that too - eating the eyeball to plead insanity - I was thinking that at first and then sort of forgot - but that is a long way to go to get the insanity defense - it is not as simple as eating or popping out an eye to get the mental illness thing - I got it for a lot less than that - that is too dramatic - I don;t buy fully it was only popping out the first eyeball in trial - to get insanity - there is some reason he popped out his eyeball  I bet - didn't like what he saw bothered by it.   get rid of pain - they could be very unkind - torture him in his mind - passed gas as I said that - - as a mental patient now - he is less dangerous too - blind - oh wow - they makes more sense - they knew he was nuts - they didn't to treat him because he was dangerous - so both eyes out makes him blind and less dangerous - and maybe he knew that - but why the first eye? - you'd do both together to blind yourself.  - other ways to get insanity - so the gremlins are that powerful - like with others there is much less resistance.   They put something in his vision - I see white sparks almost at times-  spider - black specs like bugs - not full illusions - but in the corner of my eye the movement - it is an illusion - with others they can do more -ugggh   - the second eye was to render himself docile and get off death row - also story gets recognition - fear of death row - yes - if you get into prison you will and can do anything to get out - the story puts pressure on non-caught criminals - that we can get you to do anything to get out - fear into criminals who work for them - not to turn over - not to stop - to obey or else - jail - and jail is awfl - yuppies fear being out of their college job and the shoe shine guy on FOX and CBS stoked that fear - if you leave baning - see - you shine shoes - no indoor computer job for you - with this - if you stop doing crimes - see yo uwind up on death row - and a guy ate both his eyeballs to get off death row - or ate an eyeball and plucked out another - you'll do anything to get off death row-  fear - instilling fear in at-large criminals - from within the prison.   And you can;t jsut decalre mental illnes-  AH - they won't buy it - even if you plcuk out an eye  and other criminals won't know - normally it is fairly easy to get declared mentally ill and not get executed - the prisoner makes scares at large people who have murdered and may face death row - or done other stuff - he helps enforce cooperation.   that finally gels it - the eye thing - makes sense there - not even plucking out your eye will get you off death row - that is the message to at large criminals.

What does the Lubbock mayor have – bubonic plague – hamster fever – that's going around now I hear. 

banks can strip Iranian and muslim names from Us - givintg inproper access to US banking system - the ACORN money likely in Obama from Europe - did they know about stripping ?


moderates are just liberals with no convictions – and at times conservatives have hats so big they cover their eyes and you can wtach Texas march over a cliff or in TX I guess into a gulch even as you yell stop-  from what I've heard – I don't vote yes on the moderate speaker though.   Like there are conservatives and conservatives – there are moderates and moderates – he is no Chris Shays.

yes CCAC liked CHIP

Pitiful Whining(Caterwauling) Hamster
we used to have a freezer in the other house – we do not have onre here – there is room and it is odd they decided not to have one – like it is pretty obvious – both in CT and nc we would not get a gas generator – while like my polish frined I remember during the CT hurricane had one and had osme normal things while I did not - - odd that that setup happened – and my parents never bought a generator in CT and we lived in rural area – we could lose power -but it got batted down – there was food in a pnatry downstairs – there was more food storage in the other hosue – didn;t have to be – but we did keep more food around – so we move into hurricane central – where they say – stock your shelves – we have $32,000 for hurricane – bought right after father died – which restricted my opening windows – but no money for a generator – no freezer – we never bought one – could have  brought one down – the garage would accomodate that – like the other house – and both mother and father have been really big in restricting food around – can never have a lot of food around – father told me specifically never morethan a week of food around in NC – we don;t have the space – WE COULD HAVE – and it is advised all over to have extra food and extra supplies – and we have only minimal things – and mother will not allow food to build up – she claims to be too tired to stock the pantry – things are too heavy to put in the house – she has energy to get what she wants – just won't get things on mine that store – never let me stockpile food – although that is recommended here – there is no reason – i should have been running out of food when she was gone a little long on her last trip – she wants it that way – barely enough food in the house to cover a few days if she leaves -

you mentioned the wedding – and the trips – she could easily be planning to stick me with an empty house and there is no money left – when she dies – no cash – so I ahve huge expenses and no way to cover them – I see that – i am angry at you all – cause the CIA set this all up and she is planning to screw and you all could move me and we are gonna play chicken and I gotta win it – not happy about that.  She will go there – they keep thinking they can psyche me out – they may – I wish you wouldn't force it – force me to have absolute trust in you – cause it really bothers me that you seem to be testing that and forced me to take the test – it seems like you should be able to stop it -buit there is this game going on I am at this point an unwilling participant in – but can't afford to lose – it's like my life I will lose.   Nd you will not explain why – what – leave me here – watching – but letting it happen – and I have to trust that at the key moment you will catch – yet your agenda is not mine – provwe what and to whom is my question  - AND MY ANSWER KEEPS COMING UP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T MY STRESING OUT OVER ANYTHING TO PROVE ANYTHING TO THEM – THIS IS NOT AN AGREED UPON TEST – EVEN IN OTHER EXAMPLES – THE LIMITS ARE NONE – THE CONSEQUENCES ARE KNOWN – YOU GIVE ME NOTHING -VERY VAGUE – SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE ME PROVING THEM WRONG – butyou feel you need it and you are going to force me to do it.   I may move to Canada even if I win.  I am not fully fair – they are attacking me – I guess that is true – any way they can – you are playing – that really bothers me – well nothing really bothers me right now-  though please don't try too hard to disprove that – arresting me for playing beyond zork -

does blagojevich normally quote poetry in speeches – like is his diction similar to other times- he sets up this parallel of an innconet man in a world gone mad – I bet he has never done that before in his life – and not even – it won;t his normal tone – his first set of speeches when accused – seem to be throwing the gauntlet down to someone in my situation who speaks sort of like me – if perhaps he didn;t have the best model to copy- but the references are there.   Chicago believe in Bsing their way through too – they are totally going there and I can see how they would have dealt with me had I stayed longer-  they don't believe in honesty either.   IL doesn't.   - I remember with Ira Glass – he was very different..  - late night catechism started in Chicago – now I know why they make fun of the nuns. 

do the activist groups allow President Bush and Vice President Cheney to speak in public now that it is President- elect Obama

Experiencing Goblin  Mind Control – or Techie Mind Control – coughing and passing gas as I title this
using youtube to find what I am looking for is becoming more like a battle – bolero – even bollero on yahoo the right song – but done for a german football commercial – so I was spelling it wrong on youtube – because of the correct song match – cute.  - you can only hear the videods we want you to until you are programmed the way we want you to be

Stop Children What's That Sound... -  Iwas aware this is one of theirs – I know it from the muppets – that is not the version I got – quite few  peace symbols.  


Depeche Mode Playing Enjoy The Silence Atop The WTC- but like the original video was gone from youtube – I didn't want to see this one so much as the original and like that was gone and other Depeche videos were there – but this one was lipped – not a great video, but not terrible - certain talk show host played the song or a line of it- wnated to riff – but it's not really a riff that he played more like 5 seconds – so someone wants a focus on NYC and getting back at the people who pushded it down – I would not suggest that as osmeone behidn it knows – if Arabs got through US defenses and hit NYC – NYC was being sent a message and the revenge it has sought on others – perhaps including lends credence ot the judgment – I wanted to say above – and am coughing as I sent this up – if the Arab or bombing in NYC got through – someone else more powerful than the Arabs may have been sending Nyc a message – shape up – Nyc has clearly said fudge you without the fudge and with another word – which does not detract but lends credence to the judgment – let us see how things play out – Barack Obama If he does get in cannot protect you – he is not in yet and there may be a last minute surprise that inhibits him from being president – I do not know – but there are termites in your foudnation and I do not mean me – the house may collapse when it is built – you say you want peace- you want to be told your way is right no matter what and you were told it was wrong in spades and your answer has been a popular Nyc hand gesture – I will bet that someone else will give you his answer in short order – no court can protect you either-  this will go above a court now – and if you try that venue with me when I speak this way – so be it - 
there was anothersong this morning – 1/9/09 – there was another song – wherever you've gone – life is now over – something like that – I don't knwo it well enough and suspect something was ripped off youtube just like has happened now in two other cases – I cannot find an exact note – I thought I type it somewhere – and yahoo search and youtbue search do not turn up the melody I remember.  - scratched under right armpit with right thumb.

So politically it is better to lose the presidential election – hope the Senate can stuff up any really bad changes – and let the Democratics really mess up everything else for two years – when they will get voted out of office – Loth went from being a lesser god in third and earlier editions to being one of the major Gods in the 4th edition – and the idea that 80% of americans approve of the policeis that the Democrats favor – Loth is ceretainly living in the Abyss or somewhere else and not on earth.   - Iraq and Afghanistan may well go to hell however – during 4 years – so I hope you didn;t think the way I just outlined – you have plenty of ammunition – I sure you hope you start spending it.  Political ammunition for those that need a Virginia Tech clarification. 

7% unemployment is like an 80s number – they are giving stuff like jobllosses 6 times more than before – but they don't define before -  - it is really sleazy to see hwo they are doing things – I hope some will consideer – NOT moving quickly – once burned – twice learned – I am hoping.  Scratching behidn right ear with rigfht ring finger. 

double standard with Sarah Palin – yes both in media coverage and terrorism used against them – there is a big double standard -

Jon-Sc – the majority of the voters only have a 30 sec mentality – get the point across in 30 sec or less – I don;t think that was the issue in the election – just a thought – but there were other small aCRON's on the ground – the voters did not change – the tactics changes – or the tactics changed more than the voters – and that was the bigger issue – and the media coverage- fiarness doctrine shuts off Boortz- and he will go somewhere else – H career ending injury but stil lget paid – which wouldn't suck -  - caller you need to pay more taxes -

-freedom and individual responsibility -  agreeing with you caller- tippingpoint of individual responsibility – if I were to hold up a mirror to those asking me to stand up for what I have done and ask them to do the same – I think they would all become pillars of salt.  - caller – biggest price we pay is stupidity -   too many people with dumb ideas are voting and they outnumber the people who produce-  is production measured in money or ideas.  Ideas more than money – invention which does not make money – that drove the country forward – the wright brothers and Ford – none of them made the most off of the invention – many inventors do not see the money – the inventor is the crux – the businessman's role is secondary- important – but saying it is more important than the inventor – that the inventor should be measured in a business standard – no – money is not the metric of societal success.  H-guy named Be3rkowitz who wrote an article – the caller is talking about making a new partyand a litmus test for candidates.   - proportionality of vote for people who work – my freidn i  am working -

Sanjay gupta not Obama challenged Michael Moore on sicko right?  -

Shouldn't Obama have to fully verfiy he is citizen to be President?  Unless we ammend the Constitution  -

Do you really think Boortz should think with his stomach – Obama good for talk  radio and Boortz gets a job – so Boortz should like having Obama in office – so Neal's ideals are worth less than bread in his stomach -  11:25 Est

determines earmarks by payback on investment – some of the things government SHOULD fund do not pay back – the military does not have a direct payback – but several things I can think of – do not payback and give benefit – capitalism does not reward all useful activity – and is not a metric for all projects

the 17th ammendment suggests that the legislature of IL should bear ultimate responsibility the way it's worded – Provided – I read that last night and said nothing because it allowed for what I wanted – legislature could decide on an election – they can pick ti and they are responsible for allow blogojevich – to be able to appoint – like they probably could both have votedto reject his pick immediately and block it and it would stand IF they wanted to – instead – like it sucks – they are trying to pretend to do something while not intending to do much – faking your sick at school – see Franz we are voting to impeach him slowly – it sounds like they could have blocked him if they wanted and did not- so their names are on Burris and on sanctioning this.   Federal prosecutors don't really enforce the law anymore – it's just another political opinion.

Glenn Beck

I don't like the dumb moron football game on glenn beck  -I would think one could just watch football and realize one is a moron - - right index knuckles touching right eye corner and touching forehead – not everyone who watches is a moron necessarily – still having to know what happens – I don't have to know – and the same with quiz -  it stops being exciting to watch people make fools of themselves – can I get back kfyo now? 10:21 EST 1/9/09 – you know they are not going to get them right – why the need to make other people look stupider than you -

by the way on Obama being a nerd – just like not every nerd I ever met is ethical -there may be a few bad nerds and there may even be a few good football players and maybe even – remote chance – a few decent marines-  with God miracles can happen.  - I also had spider man for a year there when growing up – can't say I was a real collector -mother selected that one for me – I didn't really get a choice – I don't think there is one polciy so far that I support of yours – in addition your potential a criminal and an illegal immigrant and now president of the united states – guilty as sin – free as a bird what a country -  you'll pull out gay rights later – and abortion – but your economic and foreign policies scare the hell out of me and are like some bad science fiction movie I am going to – europe is joining in – controlled capitalism – in truth that is probably – but not necessarily with people who can tell you not to make stuff – we're not there – ready or mature of for that- no one is qualified to control the economy – and I am not sure if I EVER support a controlled economy that it will be anythng like europes- centralized – i think the centralization is the weakness of the economy – the best is to decentralize the economy which in a natural market should occur- but the best method wins – yes because currently we do not allow copying of the best method – we have patents – what if a patent could no longer prevent copying – patents guarantee profits – that does not have to guarantee no copying for there to be profits- but some nerds are good and some are not – and I still am able to believe – some mariens are not good-  but some may be.  Cheers.  Backy and I are nerds of a different feather and I don't play basketball anymore-  at least not regulatly. 

polish porn on Gaza TV - I think I get it – knowing your friends and your enemies is seeing all their sides I guess – I haven't been watching Israel in  the last few days – in a way it's a good thing – the trillion dollar shell game going on in congress is a tad of a problem

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

exposing a secret society does have issues – the Mason affair. 

things can't go good – go well – go bad – I guess that is correct – go bad is correct or going going poorly. 

the bag with that 3 year old who was dead – was missed the first time and discovered when a man had to urinate – and went near it – gremlin – inducing urination or the need to go – they can do that.

okay to have a union if not for political power-  forced negotiation – what about that unions discourage rewarding merit – if I were to replace a union – a voluntary company that did not close a workplace – and could guarantee certain benefits – perhaps like free agent players compared to nonfree agent players – and the union represents non-free agent and free agents are separate - - but  better yet – a network of people – who individually decide to supprot or deny for grievances – something like that-  I do not like unions in their current form – I am not usre I like the concept of unions at all – prefert o turn everyone into independent contractors – and maybe they could vote to supprot each other on policies – but not knowing made the grievance – so it's not supporting a friend buy a policy – but something like an employment agency is what a union could morph into – where it guarantees training and a way to help workers not get mistreeted – but it always become more than that some authoritarian power base- where it tries to ocntrol the company and workers and discourage initiative.  And that is where the union  has done harm. 

Rich and uber rich – caller my parents combined make $100,000 – I have around a 3.7 0 close to my stats – at the time of CCAC – why should people with lower grades get scholarships – and a slap at me for taking a scholarhip away from a “more deserving person” - because I took all the good scholarships away from poor people – and I know CCAc and Pittsburgh didn' think I should get a scholarship and made sure I missed dates or didn;t a key thing so I wouldn't qualify – have to go in as full time student to be considered – maybe though merit should count for something – cause in the end do we want all those educated who do not perform and how many people like me should be overlooked to make things  “fair” - and prejudice was a factor in the decision not to give me a scholarship – but a typical odd call – Pittsburgh won't make a policy and stick to it- it;'s own have to win.   And this about that and they want me guilty for wanting a scholarhsip because my parents were rich – but of course I was not – and they deprived me of income for their kids - - should we not promote merit – or better get education to the point where all can get it – not federally funded necessarily – but much could be done to reduce the cost of providing decent education today and the professors and teachers block it.  - but we are getting into hashed territory – mother was at door trying to stop that – I never did get a scholarship for college – not one as I recollect – there is one I oculd have taken if I went to the University of buffalo  and didn't major in intended major – but that was it. 
- a pareent's money is not a childs and you are assuming all parent's love their children.

Do not necessarily like a longer school year and organized instruction –  forced or coerced instruction is only so effective and I do support more of it – until it can be shown to be effective- it seems to be getting less effective-  I would not advocate a longer school year – unless the children pick what they want to learn and I would not trust that if it was under “parental supervision”.

Alright I'll stop =- the dod.gov contact from is AGAIN malfunctioning – this time with spinning out – timing out errors – I jsut don;t get responses to get to the new pages upon submitting – and we didn't thoroughly vet the website but if properly functioning – it should have let me through.  Can't get a message to dod – because I don't exist as Bush is out of office.  Ho ho ho

Senator or I'll make it a general note - if there was a subject heading right now that just lead(read) ARRRGGGHH!!! - that would be the topic I would choose a lot currently.

Do not necessarily like a longer school year and organized instruction –  forced or coerced instruction is only so effective and I do support more of it – until it can be shown to be effective- it seems to be getting less effective-  I would not advocate a longer school year – unless the children pick what they want to learn and I would not trust that if it was under “parental supervision”. - school is  teaching much now – we are doing more of it – Wright brothers didn't occurr during class time.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

rubbing back of head with right hand as I email this

page 14 the “Arsenal” book I just got by Erik kjerland which makes my not wanted list – there is a table for the effects of intimidation – the other side takes that as bible – and believes in using intimidation as does mother – I accidentally flipped there – Perpetuated Press is the Author.  - and it was frightening with mother - not because she hurt me - but because it was sudden and completely unexpected  behavior - smart strategy to suddnely go at me in an unexpected way - it does violate the rules - she cannot assault me - it breaks the rules - and if you break the rules - others can break the rules to you to REMIND you that there are rules and that if you force it you can get a no rules conflict - and you are not prepared for what that means - enjoy winter. 

she let the water run – I used water last night – hot water – to defrost the sphaghetti – she didn't want me to have it – she instead of making it last night she made shrimp and froze the sphaghetti to defrost it – last night it was in the refrigerator section – but still frozen when she was gone – and I figured out that if I ran water over the bottom I could get it out to microwave which foiled her plan of making it very difficult for me to get out without microwaving the whole thing which may have damaged the container – so when I went down just now – she ran the water – and was waiting for me to grab it – and I did not on purpose – as she turned it on – we both let it run a minute when all it had to do was wash a plate off – I usually don't let water run – and DAM tested me with cleaning one night my black “friend” from NC – and Pittsburgh – that it bothers me to let water run and mother was testing to see if it did bother me – because they didn;t expect me to run water over something frozen to get it out – and I did – by having it frozen and in a plastic tin she was trying to block me from cooking it up – because she was trying to control what I ate and I defeated her control – and right now she tested the water – that it doesn't bother me and that in the future she has to plan for that – that I might use large amounts of running water to defeat a barrier she puts in my way – it also let me know that this is revenge for last night – the little assault incident – she said as I ran into my room - “good I made you move” - I should have rights to eat food – she does not have the right to control what I eat – she did make the meatballs-  but she insists on making dinner and refuses not to not make dinner – she also made me a salad annd I know she knows in addition to me telling her not to make me salads – she made me one anyway – to force me to eat what she wants me to eat – I take what vegetable matter I choose – she wants me to eat lettuce – and I survived much of Pittsburgh without lettuce – I don;t hate it – it has no nutritional value – it takes up space -  she wants to control the food in me and i keep saying no as best I can. 

mother just chased me up the stairs trying to grab food out of my hand and assaulting me by punching me – I to lock the door to stop her – I was in the kitchen and went down and she decided to grab the ham out of my ham because she was cooking sphaghettti and decided I should not eat before dinner time – apparently – I asked why she wanted the ham and she said because she was cooking sphaghetti – she chased me up the stairs – not doing harmful not hitting with force – but assaulting – she is not supposed to do that and if she will not obey the law perhaps God will intervene whom she may learn to fear and respect.  She did let me go back down to get the cheese – or I went back down to get the cheese and she nearly followed me upstairs testing how much tension she had instilled in me.  16:08 EST 1/13/09 – she is cooking so there is no real reason for her to follow me upstairs – trying to get me to hit her.

Sean Hannity



the caller pointing parts of the quote-  I didn't pay attention to it and he is pulling a gotcha – but I was writing and honestly after everything it is a  detail and not the biggest issue that her husband is getting to accept donation – the caller was pulling a gotcha on me – for not listening as I was typing – whatever  - 15:54 EST 1/13/09 

sttill can't get to randy.house.gov - 2nd attempt about 15:53 EST – this is written 15:55 EST 1/13/09

paste error house.gov/jackson - 2nd time successful 15:46 EST 1/13/09

cannot get to randy.house.gov – or it's timing out-  15:43 1/13/09

why hannity repeating boxer's line – elections have consequences – her ? - the queen of the polar bears – I would be HIGHLY reluctant to write her – I think he is mocking her. 

senator clinton should have lots of conflicts with her husband's foundation to be confirmed – it is true – you cannot accpet donations and pretend she will be an unbiased secretary – perhaps she is capable – but it doesn;t look great – in addition – nominating here is violation of the constitution – but details details-  how nuts can it get?   She AND HER HUSBAND will have a VERY POPULAR charity it would appear – but not to those who get what is going to happen and that she wilol have little or no influence with the meanie greenies running aorund the whitehouse. 

hannity – IN is not always my favorite state, though parts of it are okay  – we avoided him in the past

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

NC if city revenue falls  then traffic tickets go up - police and traffic tickets – cops get that if the budget falls their jobs can be cut – hmmm

coup now with a financeer and holocaust dropped with madocks this morning – ho ho ho

computer stealing in a school - a way to prevent children from learning computers – grows education budget and the one tuime reason versus annual expense is not usually rememkbered – see we needed to raise the school funding 6% every year – yeah but you had a major break in last year and that's not a yearly expense – Oh right 

On Getting Long Horns into a State of Zen Like Peace If You Ignore The Occassional Stampede Rumble
but don't different Texans want different things for Texas? - Yes Dearie – flying boomeragn sucy piranha fish – something like that in 1992 – Deerie Wearie – mising topics – but yes Dear Pratt – different Texans want diffrerent things for TX – HOWEVER – turning this into a proof – there is probably an optimum or optimal bunch of stratagies to distribute resources in TX or any in other resource allocation problem – there are optimum regulations and optimum resource allocations and political persuasion has little to do with that equation – this set of ideas works – this set does not – it does get that simple – now there is complexity – what works – one is not perfectly sure at first, but over time what goes wrong and what goes right tells you and political persuasion does not change the optimal outcomes – if you want the society best able to provide for itself and survive do this – Republicans and democrats are supposed to be two competing views on the optimum stratgey – NOT 5 YEAR OLDS YANKING ON THE COOKIES SEEING WHO CAN HORDE THE MOST FOR THEMSELVES – IT SHOULDN'T IN THE END MATTER THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNING VERY MUCH SO LONG AS THEY SINCERELY ARE TRYING TO MOVE SOCIETY FORWARD – THAT IN THEORY IS THE PREMISE EVERYONE AGREES – BUT APPARENTLY NOT – SOME PEOPLE IN POWER WANT TO KILL THE US AND REFORMAT IT AND KILL OFF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEY DON;T LIKE – AND PRETEND WE DON'T KNOW THE SOVIET UNION FAILED IN THAT FORMAT – THEY WANT TO REMAKE IT – THAT IDEA IS UNIVERSALLY WRONG AND SOME PEOPLE WHETHER RIGHT OR LEFT ARE RIGHT  - you either purse a known working strategy and add new – puruse working strategy and punt the new – purse and non-working strategy and try new things – or pursue a non-working strategy of governance – dress up your rationals for whay any freaking way you want that is what one ends up doing – usualy it appears in a tug of war and theatrics called debate which is entirely unecessary for decnet political discussion but must make politicans feel good – one could just write the theory down of what to do next and ask opponents and supporters to state points for and against and if done in a logically implied format – where you get to a decision from conclusions – maybe assumed premises – but you know which are assumed and which are fact – to do get to a decision in this manner- long winded speeches are not needs – just put down the points – refute or agree or counter the argument on such and such a point – but our politifcians and most in the world enjoy chest pounding much more and build elaborate outdated chambers called Congressional Parliamentary buildings for pounding their chests in – and so we have the system we have – where the art is saying something that has absolutely or little substantive value and that is the art verus figuring out best argument and doing ti.  One might go ARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  - at this state of affiars but one is owrn out today at seeing everything else the kids are playing with – a TRILLION dollars – cool – can I get a solar powered golf cart for my polar bears?  For use in winter in the arctic when there is little arctic sun? But yes a good leader tries to get society onto an optimum scenario of governing and AWAY FROM WHAT WE APPEAR TO BE DOING NOW  - but much of being a good leader is party or eographically indwependent  -but food fighting over dollars for your state – your party and your district or constituents is not in most cases the optimum way to governance – but it appears most people in DC think so -  

Maybe This IS(Is) Specious – But I Wound Up There In East Haddam And I Wouldn't Of 
“At last I think I've found the key, I get him psychologicly – by destroying the world's symbol of Goodness – Superman -  Revenge revenge oh it would taste so sweet” - gOH – goodspeed Opera House – 1991 – 1992 Season – not the most famous play – complete with evil Arabs -  and yes I couldn't remember the name – is it harder to remember a play when the name does not appear in the main songs? - though it might be and I just can't remember than song – yes that was the musical playing at teh GOH when I got fired – meeting amanda mcbroon which I mentioned in the mental hospital because the music lady played her song.  Ho ho ho ho – Heartbeats played at the Goodspeed in Chester -  but on the town was the very last musical while I worked there.   And mother gave me tickets for winter- saw the 3 stooges as a musical and was completely fooled which my “friend” commented on – that I couldn't that the sponteity in the acting was mostly fake – with a small exception - - but a woman came up to me started a conversation about how much was fake and how much was real – a good way to test how much I knew.   Would understand – ho ho ho ho ho – and on youtube there is Garfield on the town that comes up in a search for “on the town “ - oddly with a little different plotline – but on the town the musical has been removed.   And let me guess on youtube when I searched for Superman the musical – I found the clip of one of the very last pieces – where superman comes out of the psychological pressure of the mad scientist and messes up the plans of the villians-  BUT THEY ARE SHWOING THAT TO ME BECAUSE THEY FEEL I HAVNE'T MESSED UP THEIR PLANS – RIGHT – AH A MILITARY JET UP HIGH – HO HO  - frehsman year on npr at CMU – on npr in 1992 it would be – Michael Tillson Thomas was doing “On the Town” - reminding me of getting fired I must have heard it on npr before the goodspeed did it – for the timing to be right – I am fairly usre it was freshman year which is before freshman summer that I heard it – 18:29 EST – 1/13/09 – on the town is an anti-war play.  It also aggrandizes New York – I had to look up it's name.  Could only remember Gabey's coming – and I think someone wanted me to look it up by that song and not by better known ones – “once more baby I can cook” or “I get carried away”. 



5:29 EST 1/13/09 – have to reboot the computer to hear mclaughlin – you use the same sound format  whitehouse.gov does – and I have to reboot the computer for them as well everytime I want to listen – it is easier to mute this type of sound file – but I can hear it – I just got used to the idea they mute it – I don't listen to too many programs with this format – so I don't know – so it's usually mute when I do check and I am just used to rebooting the computer to hear mclaughlin.com or whitehouse.gov – or anyone else- a couple radio stations I think use this – most that I can hear use another format – and the others use formats avaiable for windows-  I was talking early about how in computer science capitalism is not perfect and there are like a gazillion sound file formats – graphic file formats and web programming standards – TES KIDS THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS A GOOD EXAMLE OF WHERE PROPRIETARY CAPITALISM PRODUCES SUB OPTIMUM RESULTS – BECAUSE YOU WANT A STANDARD BUT EACH COMPANY HAS A VESTED FINANCIAL INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT INTERFACE WITH THEIR COMPETITORS – OR THAT IS THE OLD THEORY – best to brand and specialize your product and screw your competitors- one might wonder =- if your product worked with your competitors' stuff then amybe you could sell to his or her customers too – but companies don't think that way – they are bent on retaining their customers first.   Maybe capitalism isn't at fault – maybe it;s just the idea that you have to screw over your competitors before serving your customer- maybe the companies have it backwards and would make more money if they were less proprietary and allowed more common use so that their product is more widely used?

I think for now I'm going to call the Newshour with Jim Lehrer the Organic Wind Famr – I was watching the piece with the commentary on President Bush and no one would defend the war – it was wrong and even the supposed Republican who would defend Bush on the Housing bubble – on the war he said it was a temporary thing and Bush would be remembered for other thngs versus  THE WAR BEING AND THE PEACE THAT MAY FOLLOW BEING THE CROWNING ACHEIVEMENT UNLESS OF COURSE OBAMA MESSES THAT UP WHICH HE MAY BY TRYING TO GET TROOPS OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND LETTING IT DESTABILIZE  - but the newshour is now the organic wind farm or perhaps just the wind farm – I do not blame Mr Lehrer – but it is an NYC and DC perspective and not a netural judgment of the President or of much else – AND THE LEFT IS WRONG AND WILL BE WRONG IN HISTORY – AS HANNITY IS SAYING ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES – YOU STOLE THE ELECTION IT APPEARS EVEN IF WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT – AND PERHAPS THAT IS THE WAY TO STOP THINGS – REALIZING THAT ELECTIONS AND WHAT HAPPENED DOES HAVE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALYL WHEN RULES WERE NOT RESPECTED. 

page 14 the “Arsenal” book I just got by Erik kjerland which makes my not wanted list – there is a table for the effects of intimidation – the other side takes that as bible – and believes in using intimidation as does mother – I accidentally flipped there – Perpetuated Press is the Author.  - and it was frightening with mother - not because she hurt me - but because it was sudden and completely unexpected  behavior - smart strategy to suddnely go at me in an unexpected way - it does violate the rules - she cannot assault me - it breaks the rules - and if you break the rules - others can break the rules to you to REMIND you that there are rules and that if you force it you can get a no rules conflict - and you are not prepared for what that means - enjoy winter. 

she let the water run – I used water last night – hot water – to defrost the sphaghetti – she didn't want me to have it – she instead of making it last night she made shrimp and froze the sphaghetti to defrost it – last night it was in the refrigerator section – but still frozen when she was gone – and I figured out that if I ran water over the bottom I could get it out to microwave which foiled her plan of making it very difficult for me to get out without microwaving the whole thing which may have damaged the container – so when I went down just now – she ran the water – and was waiting for me to grab it – and I did not on purpose – as she turned it on – we both let it run a minute when all it had to do was wash a plate off – I usually don't let water run – and DAM tested me with cleaning one night my black “friend” from NC – and Pittsburgh – that it bothers me to let water run and mother was testing to see if it did bother me – because they didn;t expect me to run water over something frozen to get it out – and I did – by having it frozen and in a plastic tin she was trying to block me from cooking it up – because she was trying to control what I ate and I defeated her control – and right now she tested the water – that it doesn't bother me and that in the future she has to plan for that – that I might use large amounts of running water to defeat a barrier she puts in my way – it also let me know that this is revenge for last night – the little assault incident – she said as I ran into my room - “good I made you move” - I should have rights to eat food – she does not have the right to control what I eat – she did make the meatballs-  but she insists on making dinner and refuses not to not make dinner – she also made me a salad annd I know she knows in addition to me telling her not to make me salads – she made me one anyway – to force me to eat what she wants me to eat – I take what vegetable matter I choose – she wants me to eat lettuce – and I survived much of Pittsburgh without lettuce – I don;t hate it – it has no nutritional value – it takes up space -  she wants to control the food in me and i keep saying no as best I can.

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind

error in computer as soon as I started listening to kfyo – chad was talking about don't ask don't telll – they lipped the sound – sound went out – had to reboot to het it back – 1/14/09 7:40 EST – had to restart browser.

Repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell
repealing don't (ask) don't tell – WITHOUT ADDITIONAL MEASURES – if a HUGE LOSS FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY – while it sucked in implementation – part of the provision that is useful is that if the gay person does not tell – you cannot prosecute them – in the military that is crucial – what Obama may do is declare open season on gays – if you just repeal don;t ask don;t tell – there is no protection – what is needed is a bill barring firing for sexual orientation – without that protection gays are at great risk without don't ask, don't tell – there are many in the military who want any gay out – and don;t ask don't tell for all it's issues – if you didn't say anything – they couldn't ask – they couldn't try to find out – that was skirted – but the law was there and it did strike fear into them – my recruiter got extremely defensive I opened my black jacket and had my flower shirt on – and we had do you have a problem speech -without saying all those words and he had to say – no I don't we  recognize the right of everyone to serve – without don;t ask don;t tell in effect – he will now answer “fudge you fag – get the hell out of here” - don;t ask don't tell was not perfect-  it did prevent some abuse – or it seems to push back – my own experience with military – they know they can't come at you openly – and Obama is being tricky becauxse here I want things hidden – where I normally advocate for openes – and I would – advocate for openess – IF other protections that prevented gays from being fired for being gay were in place – but Obama didn't promise that – so he struck a deal with the military to win the election – they should burn in hell for that.  - I think it depends where you are – military people do have issues with gays – do seek to keep gay people out of the military and in my case went after me because they thought I was gay – drugs did get mentioned by the recruiter – he was having a conversation with someone else – drug dealing is big in the military? - they would potetnially have access.   My eyesight is decent – Bexcause of my habbits – my background nad the flower shirt I wore to the recruiter's office when he didn't answer my calls – I didn't initially – but he was slow to answer calls – not returning them – and I had to force or ask forcefully-  I want to take that test – and I wore the flower shirt that night – yes I'm an artist – that shouldn't be a problem and it better not be – I HAVE TAKEN SH_T ALL MY LIFE FROM OUR  WONDROUS CULTURE FOR BEING AN ARTIST DESPITE MY OTHER ABILITIES AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR I WANT TO KNOW THAT – i AM QUITE PROUD OF BEING WHO I AM AND IT WILL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL THAT I LET ANYONE TREAT LIKE DIRT FOR BEING WHO I AM -  and I did mean to communicate that in some form – and apparently I did – I thought if I had a problem or didn't like it he would say more- I never anticiapted – that he would nod at me and then break every ethic there is – that I did not anticipate – to me that breaks ethics-  and he was instructed – he did not act alone – but to me  - YOU NEVER DO THAT -  if you don't like someone – the people who do basic training have to know the rules and should respect – yeah – he's “funny” – but he did pass the exam – but it doesn;t work that way0-  they get rid of people they don't want to be in the military so issues don't come up – but in an illegal way – that is an issue with don't ask don't tell – that they instead knife the back – but that is better than blatant – we just won't accept gays – you better smell and act right in front of us – or we'll run you out just for being different – in my case I appear not to be gay and they got it wrong – I just come from the heater world – you figure out a way to correct the next level of issues – Obama appears to be going back to square one.  I really hope he gets arrested and barred from office and I think he has committed crimes to bar him from office-  certainly Obama nad military collusion to hurt gay people is against the Constitution.   There needs to be protection for gay people in the US I am willing to bet if that service is to be successful. 

South Beach Diet FL – and I had south Beach diet bars from rite aid in Pittsburgh in 2006 – and then the story on video games and Tv being harmful so get a toolkit and fix the fix the lawnmower – again I have several recent video game releases from microsoft - - but let's dance – I did not hear the first piece which is the important – the why it is harmful to kids – that is a game and I don;t have to write in the way where I don't listen – if I need to I can write the other way.  But that is a game and the abc news announcement is dirty – and it is good to focus on your thought – like I getthat if I listen to what you say- yo u interferewith my thought and being able to foucs my mind on what I wnat is more important than missing what I don't focus on – it's the game you play with everything – “in moving you will miss improtant details” - you try to stop people from trusting their intuition by in most cases setting up artificial places where a detail is crucial and in most cases that can be fixed anyway – trusting intuition and having strong focus is a superior skill if you can do both at once that is good – keep the first thought first though. 

you can test for AIDS  - they are afraid of getting AIDS from gay people – oh please – that is prejudice – again you can test for AIDS – though test results can be wrong – but – you never know anything in life for 100% - you could get it 90%+ that that isn't going to happen.   You can be electrocuted in a shower too and not plan for that. 

kfyo silent – the standard morning trick. 

Hannity – I don't really want to see a Republican sort of doing the narrow partisan newscast stuff the liberals do – or I will call you a conservative – it didn't get as bad as it could have – I am starting to like Hannity and Colmes together better tahn Hannity because it seemed more focused on news – the CBN news – the 700 club tries to give a Republican or sconservative viewpoint to news – CBN in itself is not slanted- the host of the 700 club or hosts will offer editorial comments- the whttp://us.mg2.mail.yahoo.com/dc/launch?.rand=7juefc450599vhole program tries to distinguish between news and editorial comments – like you kind ofthought jouranlists were supposed to do – what stories that are covered – that may slant conservative – which is okay-  if they are accurately I don;t mind that as there are other news source that cover liberal storeis  HOPEFULLY in a way consistent with good journalism – but my point with the 700 club is there is a model of conservative jjournalism – that is not corner and does not do campy and trite bashing of a poltiical figure -I would not say some of the things i say in email in the same way as  I would say them on TV - - you can make biting comments at times – Anne coulter I do not feel is out of line – but I worry about oversimplifying – I cringe at the he's gooder bumper sticker I got from DAM which qualified as Democrat Humor and did refer to the current President – that he is a moron when he speaks – which is not necessarily true – I don't really want a Republican host doing that – or a conservative host doing that -calling out certain things that do get “brushed over” on the organic windfarm or other media outlets as may happen as yes they apparently are still talking about global warming as a serious issue – now that global cooling has been predicted – and yes the argument that massive cold is due to climate change and Co2 sound plausible 0- for various reasons I bet it is total bunk and I bet if we have several cold winters – people will begin to wonder about the “veracity” of our “sincere” climate change scientists who do not got funded from anywhere – but I did laugh in spite of myself at the interpretation of hillary clinton – Lib-er-al  - she looked very careworn at the whole process and yes I have once said the same thing about our current male President, but I do notice it faster in a woman for the record – but do not watch John Stuart or Jon Leibowitz too closely – though you may ignore – you may have another long term agenda – kind of like it took me a while to see what is going on with Sarah Palin as the VP pick – which was not the pick to win against Obama – but may have accomplished other goals –  but like glenn Beck can – you are getting a tad childish – even if you are about 13 years older than I am the interview with Bush I liked – I don't look forward to the right adopting tactics of the left – the interview with the author was okay – there was a quip at the beginning that made me cringf – I didn't cringe – using that word a lot – grimmace a little.  The great incarcerator – because we don't have debtor's prison anymore – you aren't that bad – you see to John Stuart which isn't good for anyone – I don;t know much about him – as I never – and I don't bother criticizing his show – there is a possible conservative humor – just be wise about it – anne coulter can get off a witty and it is conservative and still – word missing from my mind - - hyperbole is the word I'm looking for – still like a short concisde character – but Ms or Mrs coulters comments tend to be fairly accurate depictors when she uses humor or charicature – Clinton was better than Obama on lib-er-al –  I also want to hear the person talk – don't like the moment by monet interruption – in Obama's case perhaps not talk too much – but in minutes format versus 10 second format - - diagram his lib-er-al thought after he completes a whole segment – to me the segments are too short could you play his segment – then show it's text and the lib-er-al translation in a splitscreen? - it's a bit jumpy – and be careful of reading too much into it – mabe have scene of Obama or Clinton as background to text – but have text cover their picture – the symbolism of that isn't bad and it gives you more room – maybe – it might cool to have almost an animation of like their transcripted words being marked up and edited or cartoon though bubbles appear out of the transcript – though I like the idea of like a professor making comments on an essay – like have the transcript on the left side of the screen and then red line their transcripts and – my english professor would write stuff like – what the hell were you thinking – as a comment to what you wrote – actually he woldn't write in one case – in that case – he sent a tape home with his comments recorded on it so you could hear him chew you out for what you wrote on your paper  I have to admit I might be able to write – whether that helped a lot or not is open to question – but it didn't do any permanent damage – I learned to write somewhere – i definitely have modified what I was taught in high school – in signifigant ways – but yes on the side – right  like wrong – you meant to say  - this and this and perhaps have those comments come up in a handwritten text format – read it too if it's done at the end – and don't feel shy about red-lining the transcript on the transcript – like crossing out – noting misspeaks – but it is an audio visual medium – do a play by play of the edit as it comes out in perhaps animated form – like the teacher is there red lining in front of viewers eyes.  And writing the words - - have them appear as if written – PBS can do it – I bet you can – on children's programming – they have words appear as if being written – though not many of the modern shows-  which do feature less words – ghostwriter comes to mind.    - Lincoln did not – he may have recognized that mistreatmentr of blacks was wrong – he did not recognize equal opportunity for blacks as I recollect 0- he considered them inferior, not equal – just that they should have equal legal protection – but not equal recognition of potential.  - may not have time for animation – have read lining appear slowly.

Aldi on kfyo – opening NYC – just like the ones in Chicago – going to compete with walmart – according to abdc news – I am having a Lloyd Benson Dan Quayle Moment – I have shopped at Walmart in North Carolin and I have shopped at Walmart in Pittsburgh and I shopped at Alid in Chicago and Pittsburgh and aldi is no Walmart – it is not  RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE NEOUHG FOR FAMILIES  in addition as stated previously it relies on second hand produce and goods and overstock versus the first hand goods of walmart – the issue is Aldi is expanding as brand names and regular retailers sell less – meaning less of the produce and goods aldi sells are available to purchase on the wholesale market – Aldi is not a solution in a recession, walmart is – it gets that simple – but the cities do not like walmart because they are pro-union – screw New Yrok, screw Pittsburgh, and screw Chicago – YOU'RE WRONG – WALMART IS RIGHT – it provides a better service to low income people – who aren;t getting rich people's trash – that is an isssue and the other is what I mentioned – in a recession there is less voerstock less “trash” from regular retailers to pick through – the produce in Aldi is spotty- walmart encourages credit for poor – other services for poor – WALMART IS RIGHT – and Aldi si not new – Chicago had it in 1998 -1999 when I was there-  yes Aldi is geramn and Walmart is Amercian and Germany get rid of Walmart – you're point! NEXT

yes starting today on hulu – the new 2 minute add – and for taken – and a 2 minute clip about a girl as she is kidnapped and you get put through the whole thing – odd coincidental thing that.  Ho ho ho ho

NC if city revenue falls  then traffic tickets go up - police and traffic tickets – cops get that if the budget falls their jobs can be cut – hmmm

coup now with a financeer and holocaust dropped with madocks this morning – ho ho ho

computer stealing in a school - a way to prevent children from learning computers – grows education budget and the one tuime reason versus annual expense is not usually rememkbered – see we needed to raise the school funding 6% every year – yeah but you had a major break in last year and that's not a yearly expense – Oh right

So This is What My Taxes Pay For ?!!? - Online and Political Close Encounters of Third Kind


wind power may be good in local areas – coal is better for antional fuel for reasons stated -the infrastructure and the variance in power have not been answered.   -the wind power companies will own Texas Tech with research grants if allowed to – and it will corrupt it.  - again no to solar as well.   Solar polar is still unpredictable – heating a column of fluid in a witer climate - - It will not be relaible even if married togehter – you will have to plan for a cloudy windless day – insulating a water tank so it always gets boiled by the sun or heated is a big issue - - how do you get heat into the water without loss – and then how do you insulate against leakage to elements – outside – veto that idea.  That will be a mess that needs to be cleaned up.  Please don't turn into T Boone Pickens.  - yes I missed the top of the street project replacement

mayor of lubbock has lingering respiratory ailment – ho ho ho – tailored diseases – a new product of these healthcare and immunology charities. 

error in computer as soon as I started listening to kfyo – chad was talking about don't ask don't telll – they lipped the sound – sound went out – had to reboot to het it back – 1/14/09 7:40 EST – had to restart browser.

Repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell
repealing don't (ask) don't tell – WITHOUT ADDITIONAL MEASURES – if a HUGE LOSS FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY – while it sucked in implementation – part of the provision that is useful is that if the gay person does not tell – you cannot prosecute them – in the military that is crucial – what Obama may do is declare open season on gays – if you just repeal don;t ask don;t tell – there is no protection – what is needed is a bill barring firing for sexual orientation – without that protection gays are at great risk without don't ask, don't tell – there are many in the military who want any gay out – and don;t ask don't tell for all it's issues – if you didn't say anything – they couldn't ask – they couldn't try to find out – that was skirted – but the law was there and it did strike fear into them – my recruiter got extremely defensive I opened my black jacket and had my flower shirt on – and we had do you have a problem speech -without saying all those words and he had to say – no I don't we  recognize the right of everyone to serve – without don;t ask don;t tell in effect – he will now answer “fudge you fag – get the hell out of here” - don;t ask don't tell was not perfect-  it did prevent some abuse – or it seems to push back – my own experience with military – they know they can't come at you openly – and Obama is being tricky becauxse here I want things hidden – where I normally advocate for openes – and I would – advocate for openess – IF other protections that prevented gays from being fired for being gay were in place – but Obama didn't promise that – so he struck a deal with the military to win the election – they should burn in hell for that.  - I think it depends where you are – military people do have issues with gays – do seek to keep gay people out of the military and in my case went after me because they thought I was gay – drugs did get mentioned by the recruiter – he was having a conversation with someone else – drug dealing is big in the military? - they would potetnially have access.   My eyesight is decent – Bexcause of my habbits – my background nad the flower shirt I wore to the recruiter's office when he didn't answer my calls – I didn't initially – but he was slow to answer calls – not returning them – and I had to force or ask forcefully-  I want to take that test – and I wore the flower shirt that night – yes I'm an artist – that shouldn't be a problem and it better not be – I HAVE TAKEN SH_T ALL MY LIFE FROM OUR  WONDROUS CULTURE FOR BEING AN ARTIST DESPITE MY OTHER ABILITIES AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR I WANT TO KNOW THAT – i AM QUITE PROUD OF BEING WHO I AM AND IT WILL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL THAT I LET ANYONE TREAT LIKE DIRT FOR BEING WHO I AM -  and I did mean to communicate that in some form – and apparently I did – I thought if I had a problem or didn't like it he would say more- I never anticiapted – that he would nod at me and then break every ethic there is – that I did not anticipate – to me that breaks ethics-  and he was instructed – he did not act alone – but to me  - YOU NEVER DO THAT -  if you don't like someone – the people who do basic training have to know the rules and should respect – yeah – he's “funny” – but he did pass the exam – but it doesn;t work that way0-  they get rid of people they don't want to be in the military so issues don't come up – but in an illegal way – that is an issue with don't ask don't tell – that they instead knife the back – but that is better than blatant – we just won't accept gays – you better smell and act right in front of us – or we'll run you out just for being different – in my case I appear not to be gay and they got it wrong – I just come from the heater world – you figure out a way to correct the next level of issues – Obama appears to be going back to square one.  I really hope he gets arrested and barred from office and I think he has committed crimes to bar him from office-  certainly Obama nad military collusion to hurt gay people is against the Constitution.   There needs to be protection for gay people in the US I am willing to bet if that service is to be successful. 

South Beach Diet FL – and I had south Beach diet bars from rite aid in Pittsburgh in 2006 – and then the story on video games and Tv being harmful so get a toolkit and fix the fix the lawnmower – again I have several recent video game releases from microsoft - - but let's dance – I did not hear the first piece which is the important – the why it is harmful to kids – that is a game and I don;t have to write in the way where I don't listen – if I need to I can write the other way.  But that is a game and the abc news announcement is dirty – and it is good to focus on your thought – like I getthat if I listen to what you say- yo u interferewith my thought and being able to foucs my mind on what I wnat is more important than missing what I don't focus on – it's the game you play with everything – “in moving you will miss improtant details” - you try to stop people from trusting their intuition by in most cases setting up artificial places where a detail is crucial and in most cases that can be fixed anyway – trusting intuition and having strong focus is a superior skill if you can do both at once that is good – keep the first thought first though. 

you can test for AIDS  - they are afraid of getting AIDS from gay people – oh please – that is prejudice – again you can test for AIDS – though test results can be wrong – but – you never know anything in life for 100% - you could get it 90%+ that that isn't going to happen..   You can be electrocuted in a shower too and not plan for that.. 

kfyo silent – the standard morning trick. 

Hannity – I don't really want to see a Republican sort of doing the narrow partisan newscast stuff the liberals do – or I will call you a conservative – it didn't get as bad as it could have – I am starting to like Hannity and Colmes together better tahn Hannity because it seemed more focused on news – the CBN news – the 700 club tries to give a Republican or sconservative viewpoint to news – CBN in itself is not slanted- the host of the 700 club or hosts will offer editorial comments- the whttp://us..mg2.mail.yahoo.com/dc/launch?.rand=7juefc450599vhole program tries to distinguish between news and editorial comments – like you kind ofthought jouranlists were supposed to do – wh
