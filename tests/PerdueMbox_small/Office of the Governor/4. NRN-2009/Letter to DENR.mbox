Dear Committee Members

My name is kris Testori. I am a mother of two. My husband is an oncologist in Wilmington. We moved here from Detroit because we loved the weather, the location, and the clean fresh air. Please, remember we voted you in. Please consider what we are saying. We DO NOT want you to build your cement plant. Do not ruin our air, our waterways, our children's health. You are elected to represent us. KEEP THAT IN MIND. VOTE how we ask. Thank you. Kris

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, kris Testori

Dear Committee Members

My name is Eric Gulberg. What is the hurry?  Considering what is at stake, an 18 month moratorium on all permits to allow for the appropriate studies to be completed is reasonable and appropriate.  "Haste makes waste".

Dear Committee Members

My name is Andrew Renton. Father of two boys, 4yo and 1yo.. Active user of our waterways, avid cyclist, moved to Wilmington for the outdoor lifestyle. Spent my whole working life in the construction industry.
This is the wrong location for a cement plant. Don't take the environmental risk that our kids will have to live with. 
This foreign company is working the system and the flaws in it to get something that makes no sense for this location. A full investigation of the risks is imperative. Only a full investigation of the risks will allow residents to assess this project. The impacts will be on residents, they should have input to whether this project proceeds.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Amy Farmer. My name is Amy Farmer and I am a Hampstead resident deeply concerned about the personal as well as environmental impact Titan Cement company will have on my family and community. As a mother as well as healthcare provider we trust members like you to represent the best for all of us, not a select few. I am asking on behalf of my son, my patients, my community, that Titan Cement company be stopped from building near our beautiful river and towns.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Mara Rose. I am a mother of two, a physician and a loyal resident of this beautiful area. It is time for the politicians of this state to put the people and environment of this state first.  Titan America is very  good at what they do, which is to exploit the natural resources for profit at the expense of the health of the people and the land. It is time to do the right thing.  I understand the need for jobs in this area, but this plant is just not supplying this area with many local jobs, though they would like the community to believe that they are.  Many of the upper paid jobs they will be bringing in from out of state.
With 2 small children, I have not other choice but to consider relocating out of the state if this plant is built. No amount of money is worth the health of our children.

Dear Committee Members

My name is John and Donna Shawver. Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, John and Donna Shawver

Dear Committee Members

My name is Cheryl McGraw. I live right across the North East Cape Fear River from the proposed plant. It looks beautiful but belies the danger already present! The river is on a state list of mercury mitigated rivers already! Please don't destroy our beautiful area!

Dear Committee Members

My name is Sharon Ely. I do not support Titan's plan for a cement plant in Wilmington.  No one I know supports this plan except for people who stand to profit from it.  It will "kill" 1000 acres of wetlands, pollute our air with dangerous toxins and has the potential for polluting our water with toxic spills and waste from the cement process.  Please, in the  name of our children and our tourism industry, don't spoil our water, air and wetlands by issuing permits to Titan Cement.  Thank you.

Dear Committee Members

My name is william gaylord. I'll make this short since I know you don't have time to spend on lengthy emails.  Please support this bill.  We need to do everything we can to prevent the destruction of our wetlands and force cement plants to be accountable for the pollution they create.  As a resident of New Hanover County I have been appalled at the way Titan Cement has skirted the law and pushed to bring an industry to our home that should not be allowed anywhere in the country.  Please do everything you can to stop them.  My support for you in any upcoming elections will depend on how you vote on this issue.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Tiffany Farina. I love Wilmingtonm and have already seen too much of our beautiful landscape and natural swamps destroyed.  I cant fathom having a plant that is so harmful to the inviorment in my backyard, not to mention it only leads to 100 or so jobs.  Please dont allow this plant to proceed.  I dont want my children exposed to anymore harmful elements.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, Tiffany Farina

Dear Committee Members

My name is Michele Leblanc. I am a small business owner who has been a tax paying , voting citizen in Castle Hayne, NC for nearly 23 years.  The proposed foreign owned Titan plant will gravely effect my life with truck traffic, air and possibly light pollution, and a decrease in my property value, that is my future retirement. Is this the America my elected officials support. It is not the America I have always believed in.  Michele Leblanc

Dear Committee Members

My name is Robin Sprague. I am writing this letter requesting you permanently ban Titan or any other company from building a cement plant so close to the ocean. It will seriously polute a major industry and affect our environment. PLEASE STAND UP FOR THE LITTLE GUY. It is sad the majority is being pushed around by rich people and those in power. When will politician get a heart? It should be beneath us to beg for something like this, so I won't. It is your job and duty to look out for US, not big business -- a horribly messy one at that. Do your duty and stop this cement plant.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Margaret Parish. As a chemically sensitive woman, i urge you to help protect the air and water of the Cape Gear Region.  We cannot afford to add any more pllutants to those we already have.  We need to preserve our resources both for those who live here - particularly our vulnerable children - and for the many who visit here as well.

Dear Committee Members

My name is . Greetings,

My name is Capt. Doug Skipper and I live in Hampstead, NC. I am a fisherman, avid outdoorsman, surfer, kayaker, boater and love our dynamic region of coastal North Carolina. I oppose Titan Cement for many reasons. Please take the time to read some of them listed below. I know we need jobs in our region, but we need good jobs that do not pollute and destroy natural areas such as the N.E. Cape Fear River. I'm really tired of industry continually trying to dump on eastern NC. Seems like the only companies that want to setup shop here are polluters and the like! It's high time we draw the line and let them know we will not be dumped on any longer.   

 Based on Titanâ€™s draft air permit application, the proposed cement plant (called Carolinas Cement
Company) would:

ïƒ˜ Create one of the largest sources of air pollution in our area for the next 50 years.
ïƒ˜ Be the 4th largest cement plant in the nation.
ïƒ˜ Be the 5th highest mercury emitting facility in the state and the largest in southeastern NC. It would be
the 11th highest mercury emitting cement plant in the nation. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that
causes disabilities in children, infants, and the unborn. New Hanover County already has the 6th highest
mercury emissions in the state. Titanâ€™s plant would move us to 3rd.
ïƒ˜ Be a significant emitter of nitrogen dioxide (contributes to smog and ozone) and sulfur dioxide
(contributes to acid rain). Smog and ozone increase health risks to humans.
ïƒ˜ Expose an estimated 8,700 students enrolled within 5 miles of Titanâ€™s property to pollutants known to
cause increased rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Titanâ€™s plant and mine would be
approximately 1.6 miles from New Hanover Countyâ€™s newest K-12 campus.
ïƒ˜ Emit nearly 700 tons of particulate matter each year, a substance that contributes to tens of thousands
of premature deaths annually from heart attacks, strokes, and asthma attacks. Children are especially
vulnerable. North Carolina already has a higher than average rate of childhood asthma.
ïƒ˜ Create a 1200-acre mine, 70-feet deep that would destroy over 1000 acres of irreplaceable wetlands,
wildlife habitat and harm critical surface and ground water within the NE Cape Fear River ecosystem.
ïƒ˜ Withdraw millions of gallons of water from the Castle Hayne and Pee Dee aquifers, lowering the water
table and risking contamination of a major source of our drinking water.
ïƒ˜ Increase North Carolinaâ€™s carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global warming. North Carolina
currently emits nearly the same amount of C02 as California with one-fourth the population. Cement plants
emit 5% of human-caused CO2 emissions worldwide.
ïƒ˜ Increase the risk of unregulated toxic emissions. Eighty percent of U.S. cement plants had compliance
violations over the last five years. Titan has had numerous violations at their plants in Florida and Virginia,
including excessive fugitive emissions and reporting violations.
ïƒ˜ Add an additional 137,536 large dump trucks to our roads each year (approximately 376 trucks/day).
ïƒ˜ Produce more than ten times the amount of cement this area used per year between 2003-2007. Seven
cement plants are within 400 miles of Wilmington, including one within 250 miles.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Debra Parsons. I am a mother, a grandmother and a nurse.  I am also a daughter.  An asphalt plant went up behind my mother's house in Hubert.  She was unable to stop it.  Her house is now worthless.  Nobody would buy a house that sits in front of an asphalt plant.  She can't use her yard.  The fallout from the plant covers everything in the yard and causes exacerbates her ashtma.  The noise from the plant vibrates the house.  
We need to stop this cement plant before it gets here.  Once it happens there is no going back.  It will effect out air, our water and our lives.  Please, do not let their claims fool you.  This plant is not safe.  There is a reason that 200 physicians are speaking up against this plant.  We don't want it and we need your help to keep it out of the Wilmington area.  Please support the people in this. We need to be cleaning up our environment for our children, not poisoning their air and water.  
Thank you for your support.  

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Julie Potter. My daughter is five years old.  My community includes other parents of young children who are deeply concerned about the impact TItan will have on our children's environment.  My pediatrician is one of the 200 in our medical community who is adamantly opposed to Titan and the resultant toxins to which our children will be exposed.  
This will also effect our tourism industry and our growth.  Wilmington is a melting pot of people from all over the country.  People from larger cities....west coast, east coast cities....who've moved to this small city for a better quality of life for their children and themselves and are proactive in Wilmington's environmental prosperity.  Longtime residents of Wilmington, as well, feel a commitment to growth that honors an inherent commitment to protecting our wetlands.  The thriving tourism industry is also dependent upon our clean, safe waterways.
It is my understanding that the 18-month permit moratorium may be overlooked....that Titan's air permit could be 'grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.'  If this happens then Titan will fit in beautifully, because this fragile economic environment will weaken, the economy will weaken, the tourism industry will decrease and the city will lose it's best asset....a host of residents who care.   It will become a city of 'weakening standards' instead of a city on the cusp of true growth.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Paula Kamenish. I am an educated citizen who votes in New Hanover County, NC, and I would be most grateful if you would listen to me and the other residents of this and neighboring counties when we remind you of our opposition to the Titan Cement Plant.  I think that Kelly Stryker, one of the founders of Friends of the Lower Cape Fear, sums up my message to you: “We can import cement. We can not import clean air and water.”

Dear Committee Members

My name is David L. Hill, MD. I am a pediatrician and vice president of Wilmington's second-largest pediatric practice. I am also a father of three children.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, David L. Hill, MD

Dear Committee Members

My name is Winfield Burnside. My name is Winfield Burnside. I am a chemical engineer living and working in Wilmington NC.  I am also a water-sports enthusiast who is very concerned about the proposed Carolinas Cement Company.  I do not believe the 120 jobs this plant claims it will provide are worth the potential risks this plant will pose to the health of 8,700 children enrolled just 5 miles from the plant.  As the forth largest cement plant in the nation, this plant will pollute our air and  water with additional mercury, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.  It will destroy 1000 of acres of wetlands and potentially contaminate a major source of drinking water in this area.  The costs this plant poses to the health of the citizens and wildlife, and to the tourism the majority of this area depends on are all reasons enough to consider Senate Bill 699.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Kent Halac. My wife and I have two beautiful small children (Alex at 1.5 years and Sarah at 3.5 years), and we live in the Porters Neck area in Northern New Hanover County very near the proposed location.  I also work in Castle Hayne at General Electric, again very near the proposed location.

We settled in this region for the natural beauty so that we could raise our children away from the dirty urban settings of PA/DE/NJ.  Prior to moving to New Hanover County in April 2005, we spent the preceding seven years in New Castle County near the other Wilmington in Delaware.  We lived not far enough from the Delaware City refinery, and I am fearful that the new Titan plant will have the same type of impact on this area that Delaware City had on that area.  The stench from that facility was horrible.  The light and noise pollution were crazy.  God only knows what was being deposited in the air and water from that plant.  When things go wrong (like they always do eventually) at facilities like these, you fear even more for your family as unplanned black smoke billows out of the facility for days while they try to get things under control.  All areas within about five miles of this facility were essentially uninhabitable.  People lived within that range, but it was no way!
  to live.  I will be within that same range with this proposed new Titan plant.

I do not want to see this area ruined in a similar manner.  I would certainly leave this area and North Carolina entirely if this were to happen here.  I can find equal new employment in other states that are more well suited to raising a family.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Richard Johnston. My wife is three months pregnant. I am terrified that we will be raising our child in such a polluted environment. We moved from Los Angles because of the quality of life here in southeast North Carolina. And now that quality will be degraded to worse than Los Angeles standards? And for what reason? We don't need a cement plant here. There are already enough cement plants in close proximity to provide for the area. And Jobs? This area needs to give proposals to businesses such as green businesses that would actually increase the value of living here instead of degrading it drastically. Pollution in our area is already too high. The Cape Fear River has enough troubles without adding  a huge polluter. If you look at Titan's record, they have been disingenuous about there prior pollution. Please, please, for my unborn child, and for all the children in our area, vote for the moratorium so that a full environmental impact can be completed. 

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Chris Hall. Dear Senator,

It is my hope that you see what it truly happening in the case of Titan America and their apathy for the detriment that their cement plant would impose on the people of Castle Hayne and the beautiful area of Wilmington. Please consider heavily what results your voting constituents desire in this situation.  Put an end to Titan America and its pursuit of the Wilmington area and North Carolina for good.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Jean Hall. Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, Jean Hall

Dear Committee Members

My name is Martha Brown. I grew up in Wilmington and spent every summer day at Wrightsville Beach as a child.  Now we take our son there and also kayak on the Cape Fear River.  We love the beautiful outdoor spaces that New Hanover County has to offer and cannot stand the thought of anything happening to this precious environment.

Dear Committee Members

My name is David Thomas. As a residential general contractor for 22 years and a resident of Wilmington since 1955, I feel that the Titan Cement plant would have a negative effect on my business and this community. Since this is only an opinion, it would seem appropriate to study this issue from and economic and scientific point of view. The NC SEPA criteria would be a good place to start.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Robert J. Lowe, Jr. . I strongly urge you to vote for Bill 699. I am a small business owner, resident of New Hanover County, Castle Hayne resident, father of three & Husband, and outdoor enthusiast of the surrounding waterways and the Cape Fear River. Titan America is nothing but bad news for our area and no amount of money generated from this facility is worth the health problems that will occur to the people our children and environment.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Laura Kranchalk. I am a mother living within 7 miles of the proposed plant site.  The pollutants from this plant will not make a safe environment for my children.  I cannot raise my family under those circumstances.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, Laura Kranchalk

Dear Committee Members

My name is Larry Schramm. People come to Wilmington for it's warmth and beauty, not for a cement plant emitting its filth into our air and water.  

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Rebecca Blake. I have 2 children who live in New Hanover county.  One of my favorite pasttimes is canoeing and kayaking on the NorthEast Cape Fear River.  In fact, my family and I have spent many a day in the river just a few miles from the proposed Titan Plant. Only later did I learn that the water there has is considered impaired due to pollution from former industries in the area and other unknown sources. I do not want to see this plant come in and destroy the wetland habitat where they are proposing to mine.  I do not want the added pollution in the river and the air.  At the same time,I am a business person and a scientist. I understand the desire for growth and economic improvement for the county.  SB 699 will allow time for appropriate data to be gathered so that a more fully informed decision can be made.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Jennifer Anderson. I am a mother of a young child, and I, like many people I know, do not plan to remain in the Wilmington area if Titan is allowed to build their cement plant.  It is with sadness that my family has made this decision, because in the seven years we've lived here we have grown to love it.  However, along with many other health professionals in our area, we strongly feel that even with the EPA's new requirements, heavy industry like Titan represents a significant threat to the health of our growing child.  For this and many other reasons, we are strongly opposed to Titan's presence in our area.

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Ivy Peterson. I am a mother of three.  Over the next 50 years, Titan would be the number one source of air pollution in our area.  How can we do this to our children. We are suppose to be making the world a better place.  

Thank you for scheduling the recent hearing to discuss Senate Bill 699 calling for an 18-month moratorium on all permits for new cement plants in North Carolina. It is essential that the cumulative impacts of this heavy polluting industry and open-pit mining operation are fully investigated, especially since Titan America plans to build their cement plant and mine along the Northeast Cape Fear River, within a few miles of one of North Carolina’s most popular tourist destinations. The heavy-polluting facility will be located 1.6 miles from New Hanover County’s new K-12 campus. More than 8500 students will attend schools within five miles of the site.

When this project was first announced, NCDENR/DAQ stated the air permit would not be issued until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed the federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Without any public notice, citizens discovered in late 2008 that Titan was on track to obtain their draft air permit before the EIS was complete because NCDENR had determined SEPA (North Carolina’s State Environmental Protection Act) no longer applied -- a determination that may be illegal. It appears that Titan America has modified its proposed plans three times specifically to avoid a SEPA review in order to obtain a draft air permit before the EIS is complete. During the next 12 to 18 months, EPA is slated to issue and/or finalize at least four different sets of regulations that will require more stringent limits on emissions from cement plants. Mercury, Total Hydrocarbons, Hydrochloric Acid, Criteria Pollutants, CO2 and solid waste will all be considered under these pending EPA r!
 egulations. If Titan is granted their air permit, they could be grandfathered in as an existing facility with significantly weaker standards.

Over the past few months, many experts have expressed concerns about the potential impacts of building the 4th largest cement plant in the United States near Wilmington, NC. More than 3,300 citizens have signed a petition in opposition to Titan’s plant. Thousands more have sent emails and letters to NCDAQ, NCDENR, and members of the General Assembly asking that Titan’s air permit be delayed until the cumulative impacts are known. Most recently, more than 150 doctors from New Hanover and Pender Counties have signed a petition opposing Titan Cement because of concerns over the health impacts to the community.

There is no immediate need for Titan’s cement plant in North Carolina. US cement demand is at its lowest point in more than two decades and our population has more than doubled without a local supply of cement -- a globally traded commodity. The impacts from Titan’s proposed cement plant and mine will impact our region for the next 50 years or more. It would be a terrible disservice to the citizens, children, scientists, medical community and business leaders of our area to not conduct a full study of this industry and its impacts on our coastal community BEFORE any permits are issued. I urge you to protect the residents of North Carolina and vote for Bill 699.

Respectfully, Ivy Peterson

Dear Committee Members

My name is Pete D'Onofrio. I fully support the initiative shown below. How we could risk exposing our people to this type of pollution is unconscienable! Please support this moratorium

Dear Committee Members

My name is R. TOBEY. We are trying to sell out home which is located less than 3 miles from the proposed plant.  We are very concerned that if Titan is allowed to build its plant our home value will drop even more that it already has making it impossible to sell.  Even if the ESTIMATED amount of new pollution to our air and water (we have a well) will be below allowable limits, it will still be much MORE POLLUTION than we currently have.  We do not need any more pollution to our fragile environment.  Please do not allow this plant to be built so close to so many homes, schools and families.

Dear Committee Members

My name is Kristin Averell. The risk out weighs the benefit in this situation.  The side effects of this plant will impact future generations.  It will decrease our tourist industry, negatively impact our fishing industry, and increase our children's exposure to a known neuro-toxin.  Please do not let this happen.
