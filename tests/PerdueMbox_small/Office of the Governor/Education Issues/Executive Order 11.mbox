Why are you furloughing teachers and other state employees, when you are spending $28,000.00 a year to keep prisoners in the matter which they are accustom to living on the outside when we only spend $6900.00 a year to educate a child in this state? By furloughing teachers that means the money that I normally spend on my classroom will not be spent on my class so my students  will do without some supplies that I have bought them in the past. These are supplies that my specail education student need to be successful on the EOG test and other testing that the state requires them to pass and school systems do not give us  the money to buy these things with.

It is honestly very sad to see someone that is supposed to be in support of education to actually cut teacher pay.  This is one of the lowest paid positions overall considering everything they are expected to do.  I am very sad to say I actually voted for this person.

Governor Attends National Guard Deployment Ceremony

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue joined Congress members, military commanders and thousands of well-wishers at Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville to say goodbye to 4,000 members of North Carolina National Guard's 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team who are headed to Iraq.  It’s their second deployment to Iraq.

“As I look out over this crowd, I see volunteers, I see citizen soldiers willing to serve our country and protect our freedoms.   I see neighbors, sons and daughters, co-workers and friends. And I see heroes...

As you deploy, never forget that 9 million people here in NC, and millions more believe in you and your willingness to serve. Your service for America is immeasurable. Your patriotism is inspiring. You are the best – the very best of America."





Governor Launches "12 in 6" Worker Training Initiative

Gov. Bev Perdue <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>this week launched “12 in 6,” a workforce development initiative designed to benefit North Carolinians who have lost their jobs due to recent layoffs and plant closures.  The initiative will create community college programs in 12 careers, each requiring less than six months to complete.  The N.C. Community College System and the N.C. Department of Commerce are collaborating on the program as part of Gov. Perdue’s larger JobsNOW initiative, which focuses on job creation and economic development.

The new training programs will be available at all 58 community colleges by the end of September. The state’s 24 workforce boards, JobLink Career Centers and Employment Security Commission offices will connect job seekers with the training programs and employment opportunities.

“Jobs now in North Carolina – that’s the goal. We know that people who have lost their jobs need to get back in the workforce as quickly as possible,” said Gov. Perdue.  “This rapid training initiative provides them with a clear path to success in new, sustainable careers.”

The 12 career areas were selected based on current and/or anticipated market demand: nursing assistant, phlebotomy, medical coding, office/clerical support, masonry/tile cutting, plumbing, carpentry, welding, food service, autobody repair, manufacturing/materials, and HVAC/industrial maintenance. 






Gov. Announces Additional Highway and Bridge Projects to be Funded Through Economic Recovery Money

Gov. Bev Perdue announced today an additional 64 highway and bridge projects totaling about $209 million that will be funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The projects identified to date total $679 million, more than 90 percent of the $735 million in recovery money North Carolina has received for highway and bridge improvements.

“North Carolina is leading the nation in efforts to expedite the selection of projects and get them under way as quickly as possible to get our people to work,” Perdue said. “Given our current economy, it is critical that we are using our recovery money to help put people to work and create much-needed economic growth for our communities.”

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

Based on these figures, the additional projects announced today are expected to help support more than 6,000 jobs and contribute nearly $1.3 billion to the economy. Overall, the projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.

NCDOT has worked with local planning organizations across the state to determine which projects will be funded, taking into consideration the equity formula set by the N.C. General Assembly. Some areas have chosen to dedicate their share of the money to a single large project instead of multiple projects, and other regions are still in the process of determining which projects will be funded. In addition, the state’s largest metropolitan planning organizations have received direct allocations of recovery money and they are working to identify projects to be paid for through this funding.

A list of the second round of economic recovery projects is can be found at <http://www.ncrecovery.gov>www.ncrecovery.gov.



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing NC Aquarium Pier

Gov. Bev Perdue has signed House Bill 628 for the construction of the North Carolina Aquarium Pier at Nags Head, which will create jobs and enhance tourism in one of North Carolina’s most popular destinations.

“The North Carolina Aquarium Pier is an important marker for North Carolina’s coastline and for the North Carolina Aquarium,” said Perdue.  “But more importantly, it will serve generations to come as a place of learning, recreation and further appreciation of the natural resources that bring so many people from across the state and beyond to our beautiful coast.”

Construction of the pier will provide 555 on-site jobs and 1,250 off-site jobs and a benefit of more than $14 million to North Carolina's economy.  Formerly known as Jennette’s Pier, the North Carolina Aquarium Pier will be an educational satellite facility for the aquariums and be constructed to protect the state’s sounds and beaches from storm water runoff.

“Jennette’s Pier has been a landmark on the Outer Banks for generations and this legislation will help expedite construction and jump-start the economy,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight, D-Dare. “When it opens, the North Carolina Aquarium Pier at Nags Head will be an environmentally-friendly attraction that will help boost our tourist economy.”

The Aquariums Division of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will construct the pier with funds from existing non-General Fund receipts of up to $25 million.  The funding will come from admission receipts, private funds and a storm water pilot project to clean up state-maintained ocean outfalls.

The pier is the oldest fishing pier on the Outer Banks and was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Isabel in 2003.  To rebuild this historic landmark, the Aquarium Society purchased the property and transferred it to the State of North Carolina. 



DRS to Add 100 Jobs in Pasquotank County

<http://www.drs.com/>DRS Technical Services Inc., a global aircraft services supplier, will expand in Pasquotank County. The company, which services U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft in Elizabeth City, plans to create 100 new jobs during the next two years.

“North Carolina remains a leader in the aerospace sector and national defense, and this project combines both of those strengths,” Gov. Perdue said. “Our state continues to support the expansion of global companies attracted by our skilled workforce, training programs, top business climate and quality communities.”

The state’s Economic Investment Committee met today and voted unanimously to award a Job Development Investment Grant to DRS Technologies to facilitate this expansion. This grant is the third JDIG awarded in 2009. While wages will vary by position, the average annual wage for the 100 new jobs is $48,779, not including benefits, which exceeds the Pasquotank County average wage of $27,872.

DRS Technologies’ C3 and Aviation Group operates a facility in Elizabeth City where it provides aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services. The Elizabeth City facility currently employs more than 200 people under a contract with the U.S. Coast Guard to completely overhaul C-130 aircraft and components, among other engineering and logistical work.

Dear Mrs. Purdue,
I absolutely cannot believe what I'm now hearing!!  I work SO VERY hard......long, extended hours...pulling game duties, morning duties, working dances to raise money for our school, participate in fundraising, attend community meetings, parent nights, festivals, among all kinds of other things for which I am not paid. 
As a teacher in this state, our supplement pay has been taken, our longevity pay has been taken, our ABC money has been taken, and NOW....I find out that my pay will be cut by .5% through the end of the fiscal year. 
I just don't understand!!  And we're supposed to greet children at school everyday with a smile and cheer them on as we keep them motivated to learn.  What about the TEACHERS being motivated? 
Sincerely concerned teacher and citizen of the State of North Carolina,

I think it is time we spend less on prisoners and more on educating our students. What purpose does it serve to spend $29,000 per inmate and $6900 per student????????????  Where is the logic in that? And now you are making our teachers and staff take a .5% decrease in pay for 10 hours of exchange time???????
There are going to be less and less individuals who even consider the teaching profession because of the way they are treated, who then will educate the future generation? North Carolina needs to wake up!!

Are you kidding me?  I am a teacher and am appalled at what you have just done with the furlough.  In your letter you mentioned that the commitment and dedication state employees show to our agencies and state are much appreciated.  So you take away an amount from our already measly salary to show this appreciation?  I am disgusted and feel as though I have been slapped in the face.  You need to rethink your decisions.

Governor Perdue:

Thank you for thinking that I would not mind giving a percentage of my salary to bail the State out of debt. Perhaps I can count on you to pay childcare for my 2 year old or pay for school lunches for my 5 year old for those two months. I do not think you have considered what an impact this will have on families, especially single parent families or families in which both parents are employed by the State.

I very much resent the fact that you are targeting State employees. Could you not have increased the State payroll deductions across the board for everyone who lives in the State? Should we not increase the State sales tax for everyone? There has to be another solution that does not include singling out State employees.  What about doing away with More at Four, a program that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and serves less than one percent of the State population?  What about cutting out public assistance to people who are in our State and Country illeagally?  What about ESL programs that serve the same illegal aliens? What about requiring drug testing to qualify for State and Federal welfare assistance?  That should eliminate several thousands of "qualified" recipients.

No, let's take it from Teachers who already spend a portion of their salaries on classroom supplies and materials and put in well above the required number of hours per week.  Let's take it from State employees who are making much less than industrial workers doing the same job and who rely on State benefits as a means of survival.  

Are you so far gone from being in the classroom and being a State employee yourself that you have forgotten?  Do you not remember that it was teachers who put you where you are today?

Thank you for your time.

Renae McRoy

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am aware of the current financial mess in which North Carolina finds itself; however, cutting my paycheck (which is supporting myself, two little girls, and my mother) is NOT the way to balance the budget.  To someone making a six-figure salary, .05% may not seem like a large amount of money, so please, look at it from someone who makes less than $35,000/year.

At URL, <http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/60444>http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/60444, Roseboro-Salemburg Middle School is reported to have a teacher to student ration of 1:14.  If you look at the school as a whole and divide total students by total staff, that may seem correct, but you know it does not really work that way.  In reality, dividing the number of students by core-content teachers is a more realisitic number. In the case of RSMS, the corrected ratio is 1:24 in the 8th grade; however, that number is also skewed.  In schools, like RSMS, that offer one higher-level math or language arts class for which few students qualify, the average class size is actually higher.  I teach three blocks of 8th-grade language arts with twenty-four, twenty-one, and twenty-seven students respectively.  Other eighth-grade teachers have classes with even more students.  In a class with fourteen students,  having one or two more would not make much difference; but in a class of twenty-seven (especially a class of special needs learners), it makes a huge difference.

Please remind the General Assembly, NC already has a teacher shortfall; increasinjg class size will accelerate the rate at which trained professionals leave the field and force schools to hire lesser prepared individuals to fill the void.

Governor Perdue,
I am writing this letter out of concern of my recent Pay Cut. I am very disappointed in your administration. I voted for you, but you can guarantee you will not receive another vote! You were elected on your basis of representing teachers, but you have forgotten who put you in office. I suggest you enjoy these four years because they will be your last. Teachers are the people that are out on the duty lines everyday yet we are the ones always suffering. Our students should be your top priority. You have cut teacher morale to the bitter core. We never receive the respect and honor that we deserve and now you have seen the need to continue to cut us to the core.
I have one question: Did you cut your pay? You are wealthy enough to not receive any pay for the remaining portion of this fiscal year. How about you putting your money where your mouth is? Teachers certainly do not teach for the pay, but I defiantly depend on mine at the end of the month in order to pay my bills.

Hello, I am an active voter in Buncombe County and I am also an employee of Buncombe County Schools. I am very upset as an employee and as a parent of a child in elementary school, to know the Governor and other legislators are cutting staff pay by .5% and making us take 10 hours off without pay. Surely, if you truly are putting children first, you can find other areas of the state government to cut back on besides the school systems. For those of us to barely pay bills that .5% will really hurt my ability to survive. Don't get me wrong, I am so glad that I wasn't laidoff, i just dont understand why you are letting this budget cut effect the school systems? The ones that will truly suffer will be the children, morale will drop, teachers, etc will find other jobs. I will be watching very closely to see who i will vote for next time, i obviously made some mistakes in the last election.

I'm unsure how my salary or any educator's salary can be cut after 
contracts have been signed.  I have already been told my salary and 
signed a contract to work this year at that salary.  Now, had you 
said that there would be a cut/freeze beginning the next school term, 
09-10, that would be different.  Would I be happy? No, but I would 
have FAIR warning.

Let's look at reality here.  Do you think we make a enough to live to 
begin with?  Several years ago, we figured up that teachers make less 
than $5/student/day.  This is just for the hours we teach; not all 
the time we spend before and after the school day ends.  We are 
living pay check to pay check not to mention that our families suffer 
because of all the work we do after hours at school/home and on the 
weekends.  Educators are the most dedicated and hardworking employees 
in any business, yet we are the most underappreciated.

Also,  do you really think that 10 hours WITHOUT PAY is a worthy 
exchange?  These are called PERSONAL DAYS which we already have and 
we get PENALIZED for taking them.  In other words, we DON'T get paid 
and we have MONEY TAKING OUT of our checks to pay for the 
substitute.  You could have given us 100 hours WITHOUT PAY and it 
would mean nothing.

Have you thought about cutting your salary?  Actually, you could work 
pro bona since you have no house payments, bills, etc... being that 
the citizens of NC pay for you to live while you serve.  What about 
the other government officials in Raleigh?  What is their pay 
cut?  Maybe if you want to penalize everyone you should man up and be 
the first to take a cut - preferably a big one.

Well -  I really know that hindsight is 20/20.  I voted for you for 
the very reason that I thought you would take care of the educators 
in our state.  It could probably be said that the biggest population 
of voters are educators since our educational system is our biggest 
employer.  You may want to consider that before the next election.

Dear Governor Perdue,

After careful consideration, I am very disappointed in the actions that you have taken today 
regarding pay cuts for state employees.  I voted for you with the intentions of keeping a 
democratic governor in office.  I believe that I have made a grave error.  

It is my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong, that teachers will have the entire .5% 
salary reduction taken from their May check while other state employees will have half taken in May 
and half in June.  For me, that is a little more than $200 out of my check.  I wish that I had $200 
left at the end of the month from a normal check.  I don't and that concerns me greatly.  Your 
comment, "Everyone is willing to give up a little of their salary" would be true if is it were a 
little here and a little there; but over $200 in one chunk is a lot to swallow.  I don't make a 6 
figure salary and it takes everything I do make to make ends meet.  This amount of money out of my 
check is really going to hurt to say the least.  

I implore you to think about the middle class who live from pay check to pay check.  I see wasteful 
spending on a daily basis and truly think cuts can be made in many other areas.  I also truly 
believe that teachers work harder than anyone in education, yet we get paid the least.  Teachers 
should be treated as the professionals they are as there would be no other profession without 
teachers.  Please remember your days in education and fight for us for the remainder of this school 
year and next school year.  During economic times such as these, a step on the pay scale and 
longevity pay is of the utmost importance with the rising cost of living.

Sincerely,
Bambi G. Dove, Teacher of 13 years

Dear Governor,

     Teachers cannot take time off.  Many of us are already clocking nearly 50 hours a week just to meet our regular obligations.  Over the past several years we have seen our mandated responsibilities increase to the point that we cannot possibly get all of our work done in a "normal" work week.  When exactly are we supposed to take time off to compensate us for a pay cut.  We have state mandated exams coming up soon, and we certainly cannot take time off now.  We are not like the road crew that can simply leave the pot hole in the street for a few more months, or the prison warden that can simply lock everyone down in order to get by with one less guard for a day or so.  We have young people whose lives depend on us doing our jobs every hour of every day.  We give much more than time to this job and honestly do not deserve this.  By they way, if we are all "biting the bullet," then why is it that the insurance companies have just been granted the right to fill their pockets with more of our money?  How much more can teachers take?  I have been a faithful servant of the state of North Carolina for over 25 years.  My family depends on me to take care of their needs just as much as my students depend on me to take care of theirs.  While I feel for the state budget, I sincerely hope that you understand that my personal budget is in danger as well.  Please do not punish us just because we seem to be the citizens who are willing to give the most for the least amount of compensation.

Sincerely,
Sherman Andrews

                        I'm most disappointed in the cuts in education in our state.  We have some exemplary schools in NC and yet they will lose teachers, pre-K, etc.  It's great to have money for colleges, etc, but you've got to get those kids when they are 3 and 4 years old.  But the little ones are being abandoned.  No excuse for it.  I voted for the current governor because of her strong, supportive views concerning education.  As I said, I am extremely disappointed in NC's elected officials.  Oh, and by the way, there is state beyond Asheville.  Sincerely, Gail Rogers, Clay County

Governor Perdue,



My husband and I are both at Waynesville Middle School in the beautiful mountains.  Ron is an 8th grade teacher and I am the Lead Teacher/Curriculum Coach.  When May rolls around, we will feel the pinch that comes with losing .5% of our salaries.  That being said, I want to take the opportunity to applaud you and your office for taking this step.  None of us wants to see our salaries impacted, but I do believe that it is a sacrifice that is fair to ask.



Because this is my 15th year in NC schools, I feel that I must look back at what I have been provided by the state when I am asked to help in this budget crisis—here are my thoughts:



1. I am a teacher because of the state of NC.  I am proud to say that I am a Teaching Fellow (UNC c/o 1993)—and am a teacher because of that full scholarship.
2. My state paid for both of our National Boards (I am certified Early Adolescent Mathematics.  Ron is certified Early Adolescent Science).  We have enjoyed the 12% salary increase that comes with these credentials.  (I am no longer paid for my National Board because I have left the classroom for this leadership position, but I enjoyed the salary increase and ALL of the doors that it opened for 6 years and will renew my boards next fall.)
3. Ron and I are both paid for advanced degrees.
4. We continue to be paid for working 200 days a year—when the calendar asks only 195 from us.  We took no salary decrease when the calendar changed.


So, a decrease in our pay for the end of the year really does create some burdens, but it is very little in comparison to what we have gained—and are having protected by the state.  I love being a teacher in NC.  My job is secure—and it is a job where I am making a difference.  Thank you for protecting teacher positions, for protecting our longevity and our benefits, and for your leadership in the state.  Yours is not a position I envy, but yours is leadership that I support.



My prayers are with you as you lead our state during this time of financial crisis.

Mrs. Perdue,
I am writing to you in response to the pay cut you initiated today for teachers. My county newspaper quoted you as saying "Everybody is willing to give up a little of their salary," Who is this everybody? I don't remember having a voice. My husband just lost his job of 21 years on 3/31/2009. He hasn't even collected his 1st unemployment check. We have our 1st child going to college in this fall, and I am currently in graduate school. Not to mention we have 2 other minor children. My family can't take a cut. I am disappointed in our state and their emphasis on education. I have spent so much of my own money on my classroom this year and in the past, and this is a slap in the face!
Trying to make do,

Governor Purdue,
I am extremely disappointed by your decision to partially balance the
state budget by cutting educators pay. I chose to teach in North
Carolina this year despite the extremely low teacher salaries in order
to make a difference for the children of the state. I have over 20 years
experience as both a teacher and as an administrator in two other
states, have a doctorate in Education Administration, and am committed
to public education. I currently make only $47,000 for my expertise and
abilities. To take any of what little money teachers in North Carolina
earn is reprehensible. I voted for you in November because I thought
among other things, you would make a difference in public education.
Perhaps I was wrong. 

Regretfully,

Ms. Purdue,
     As a veteran teacher in the state of North Carolina, and a lifelong democrat, I am appalled by your recent cuts of teacher salaries.  Maybe you need to come to Alamance County and see what teaches are working with and the conditions we must tolerate.  Teachers in North Carolina are plagued by inadequate classroom resources, out of date technology, gang bangers, felons, non-English speakers, administrators who sit in their offices all day, poverty, child abuse, and a general lack of community support for the teaching profession.  I invite you to come to my classroom at Graham High School to get a first hand look at the mess this state is in. 
     You are a former teacher and that is why I voted for you.  Where is your loyalty?  You have forgotten how many roles a teacher plays in a given day:  nurse, mother, social worker, guidance counselor, probation officer, motivational speaker, and lastly, teacher.  I thought you would look out for us and take better care of us than history has shown.  I'm sorry I wasted my vote.

You must be kidding.  Are you somehow under the delusion that teachers can afford for these cuts to be taken from two paychecks?  Perhaps if we were paid as well as you, those who work for you, or perhaps as much as the person holding the duplicate position you created in education then perhaps we could afford this type of hit.  Will you pay our bills for us when we can’t afford to?



Just when do you propose a teacher take 10 hours off?   Are we to miss a day of school and let the schools pay for subs? 



You were elected as a friend of teachers.  Enjoy your one term.  I can assure you that I will save up during your term in order to donate at least an amount equal to the pay you are taking from me to whoever runs against you.   Our premiums go up, our deductibles go up, our class sizes will go up, the work you want done goes up, you demand more and more—and we are slapped in the face. 



This would be a lot easier to accept if you spread this out over 12 months, but to let us know now—just before we are to take a financial hit that is coming in one short period is an insult, and one we will not forget.

  I did not realize that it was the responsibility of the public schools in NC  nor its' employees to fix the budget woes that our state is facing.  This has certainly been a difficult year but we have done what teachers do and  gone on doing what God has called us to do...more and more with less and less...Then, the news came that we would lose VALUABLE faculty members and have an increase in our class size, but again, we continued on, knowing that these children needed us and we would again do what God has called us to do.  Then furthering the anxiety  by freezing state spending and knowing that we would operate on what we have and not recieve any further funding from the state...continuing to spend our own money and again doing what God called us to do.  Everyone just dug in and knew that we would survive this.  News of our insurance company not having the money to pay our claims and rate hikes in our family coverages because of mishandling of funds came and again, we knew this would be hard, but we would do what we were called to do.  But today, for me a final slap in being told that teachers and other state employees would have.5% of their salary reduced and further more we would have to take 10 hours off from our jobs without pay...I felt all the optimism that I had held on to go away.  I have done this for 21 years and have always felt that what I was doing was important.  But I am slowly realizing that we are scapegoats.  It is apparant that the people who are in charge of doling out funding for the schools in North Carolina are obviously not interested in investing in the future.  When they will not begin to think about cutting their own salaries and continue to pass ridiculous legislation that benefits special interests groups, and yet, will continue to take money away from the children of North Carolina...all of them should be ashamed.  Even the prisoners in  North Carolina are treated with more respect than the school children.  Unbelievably, even while cuts and furloughs are being issued to the guards and law enforcement personnel, I have not heard of any prison cancelling the cable, closing its weight rooms, or the "free" laundry services (among other amenities) that our prisoners enjoy.  Believe me, I believe that the children of North Carolina are the only hope for our future.  By educating its youth, a community ensures its success.  But, obviously, the decision makers do not see it this way.  I looked in the faces of my 23 second graders today after reading this edict from the govenor's office and tears filled my eyes.  Because thanks to the decisions made over the last few months and certainly today...their future is now much bleaker! 


I also wanted to express my dismay  (AGAIN) that Gov. Perdue was endorsed by NCAE.  She certainly has not proven to me, nor to many of my colleagues, to be a friend of public education.  Our prayers are that she, and the NC senators and representatives, will realize that there is no more blood left in these turnips...there is not much more that they can take away from the public schools.

The Honorable Governor Perdue,

Shame on you for trying to balance the state budget on the backs of state employees.  Why not raise all sales tax across-the-board.  That is a fair tax on all citizens - the more you buy, the more tax you pay.  Cigarettes and alcohol should be taxed at the highest rates possible since these are optional taxes.  Several years ago, we paid higher taxes on food, try to re-instate that tax.  That is also a fair tax, the more you buy, the more you pay.  Most citizens are obviously eating too much food, perhaps this could be an incentive for some people to lose weight.

State workers are so hard working.  Now when parents need to have more money to pay day care expenses during the summer months when school is out, they will receive a pay cut - this is when they need the money most.  This is most distressing.  I understand the budget is bad but really.  Certainly the money can be found elsewhere.  You have added staff to your office, you've added a Piedmont Office with mulitple staff and expenses, and you have added a double position in the Department of Education along with his staff, office space, office and equipment expenses and expense account.  These are added expenses at a questionable time.  You promised to be an Education Governor but cutting the salaries of teachers does not demonstrate that commitment.

I am a educator at the top of the pay scale.  I enjoy my work but last year, I didn't get a pay raise, now I'm taking a pay cut.  This is most unfair.  It seems to me some jobs could be cut before you cut salaries.  Really, will cutting the salaries of state employees stimulate the NC economy?!?  I think not! 

I realize you are facing tough choices but certainly there other areas to save money.  We also could sell some of our state park land.  I remember a few years ago when there was much discussion about selling small parts of Umstead Park - what valuable property that could be!!!  This is yet another way to generate revenue.

I further realize you inherited most of these problems but again - should state employees be the bearers of this burden?  No - teachers are the most educated professionals that receive the lowest salaries.  We obvioulsy love our jobs but, pay cuts are demoralizing.  For most jobs, we will be obligated to complete the work of those 10 hours anyway. - that is a joke!!!  Teachers are one of the best bargains that the state gets for the kind of work we do.

Again, shame on you for using state employees to balance the budget.  This has happened to us before and I'm sure it won't be the last time.  I am most disappointed when you campaigned on the platform of education.  You were Lt. Gov. for 8 years, surely you saw some of this coming.

I would appreciate a genuine response, not a "canned token" electronic response.  Thank you for your time!!  I wrote this at home on my home computer - where I am working late into the evening.  I am never compensated for the work I do at home.  Again, another great bargain for the state that goes unappreciated!!

Dear Governor Purdue:

I'm a teacher, and I'm not happy with your executive order today. How is
it fair to penalize state employees 1/2% and not penalize other NC
citizens/workers? Why not execute a flat 1/2% tax for everyone in order
to balance NC's budget? I understand that the budget must be balanced
and that difficult decisions have to be made, but you said during your
campaign that you are FOR teachers and education. Obviously, your
actions speak louder than your words.

Dear Mrs. Purdue:
I am a high school teacher in New Hanover County, and I am responding to today's announcement of the half-percent pay reduction. Please be aware that I know that there is a budget crisis and that you and your staff are doing everything in your power to solve the problems you were elected to handle. However, I cannot let this pass without expressing my disappointment with this decision. Now, I acknowledge that a half-percent may not be a significant amount of money in the big scheme of things to a lot of people. Ultimately, it is one less dinner out for my family next month. But, there are other things going on in our schools that can be cut before you begin taking the money out of the pockets of your classroom teachers.
The first I would like to address is the practice of hiring retired teachers under contract. I understand the original intent of this practice; it was a fantastic solution to a critical problem. To borrow from the adage, the road to budget crisis is paved with good intentions. This hiring debacle is abused and exploited by counties all over our state, and the "regulations" under which these contracts are intended to fall are not being enforced. Retired teachers are "double dipping" throughout our school system, and highly qualified, trained new teachers are being passed over repeatedly for open positions that are being awarded to these people. Before you take money from my check for which I work very hard and plan to do so until I choose to retire, please consider reviewing the contracts of these retired teachers, the hiring practices being used to allow them back onto the state payroll, and the conditions under which these people are being hired.
Second, I would be remiss if I did not question the logic in cutting the pay of instructors in lieu of cutting the positions of some teacher assistants. Highly qualified teachers are trained to teach; if the luxury of teacher assistants in the classroom were taken away, those same classroom teachers should still be able to teach. Assistants provide useful, valuable resources to our students, no question, but is each and every one of them such a vital cog in the education wheel that this is the only option? I have had up to 36 students in a single high school classroom with no assistant available; surely an experienced, certified elementary teacher can handle a class of 20 2nd graders without an assistant "until the end of the fiscal year," the estimated duration of this pay cut.
On a personal note, the most disheartening part of this experience is that I have been confident and thankful in the midst of our current economic crisis that the federal, state, and local leaders responsible for decisions related to my employment status as an educator have had my best interests in mind. Today is the first time I have questioned that core belief, and it is deflating. I became an educator in order to make a difference in both my community and the lives of my students; the difference you are making in my life brings shame to the office I helped elect you to hold. I cannot help but wonder what future decisions will be made to balance the budget: this time, my family misses out on the luxury of a meal prepared by someone outside my home. Do I need to worry that the next solution will cause my family, like so many others across the country, to miss out on the "luxury" of remaining in our home? 
Sincerely,
Merideth Wilson

The cuts you are making to education are disasterous. The effects will effect our future. Programs for children with disabilities are being cut and untrained regular ed teachers are expected to do the job of a specialist. Making ends meet on the salary of a teacher is hard enough you are now cutting our pay?  You have frozen supply money. How are the children of NC supposed to be taught?  Out of the pockets of the teacher salaries you just cut!  What sacrifices are you making?  You abused the education lottery funds- they should be used for education!  The cuts being made at the elementary level will have a negative upward spiral. Please realize the damage that your decisions are going to make. NC children and educators deserve better.

What a sad day for education in NC.  In reward for all our hard work, we receive more unpaid work time and lose part of a paycheck that is already committed to our bills.  Do other state employees besides public school teachers spend time at home on weekends working on PEP's, grading papers, or planning lessons?  No, they are not allowed to work off the clock, that is ILLEGAL.  Do other state employees coach school children for .25 per hour (when you count time with kids, to and from games, meets, time waiting on parents, and yes time at home to do lesson plans)? 

We completed a 20 hour online course to score writing tests this year during our "planning" time. We then spent many more planning periods in meetings or grading papers. 

When you said Education was a priority--you sure meant it.  Was the unstated "How fast can I tear it down?" 

I think this is a serious mistake.  I hope all the legislators, yourself, and everyone else who receives a paycheck from NC takes the same "furlough".  Oh, that is another thing, with REQUIRED system workdays, exactly when were we suppoed to take this furlough? 

I understand the financial situation--we have lived in it everyday for longer than the people in Raleigh realize.  But this is not the solution. 
Cut out waste. 

Very sad in NC.

Governor Perdue,

During the current course of the events in the United States, I can not help but to wonder where the justification of all the borrowing of money from China, the tax responsibilities that are laid upon the US taxpayers for buyout purchases for private industry, and all the craziness that we live in each and every day.  I have been quiet till now. When the crisis hits my pocket book directly in exactly two days from now because of a said Executive Order, I must wonder does this sound remotely like that of a Queen 3,000 miles away initiating her power of taxation without representation. You see, it is understood that I am a Public Servant not a private employee.  I do not understand that you can just have an order that you can just deduct pay from people that are public servants. I also wonder if you will  be included in this pay cut as well as your cabinet and legislature. Morally if you do this I would expect you to follow your one rhetoric. Also, have you thought about what would happen if all of the state employees took the same day(s) off.  Further would you impose a 0.5% tax increase to every taxpayer in North Carolina? I can not believe what is going on here. Please respond with a thorough explanation and hopefully you will re-think what a horrible decision you have made. Effecting thousands of mouths to feed.

Just wanted to say.  I apprecaite all that you all do.  I am upset about the pay cuts and concerned for my family.  I am not being rude I just am trying to understand.  I know the lottery is suppose to help and it seems to be doing NOTHING!!  I am very involved in my children's school and I also sit on the School Improvement Team.  So I am a very informed teacher.  I am not sure how they are suppose to do their jobs with no money in the budget and when they where using their own money in a lot of cases now that has been reduced too.  I am sure your job is overwhelming right now. 
I am praying that God will lead you and be very powerful in your decision making.
Blessings and Prayers,
Sherry CHucci

Governor Purdue,
Let me begin by saying that I sent you an email about your decision to use lottery funds for purposes other than education, and as of today, I have yet to hear from your office. I supported and voted for you in the November elections and you continue to disappointed me and my fellow teachers.
I cannot believe that you have implemented a pay cut for us in these current times. I know the economy has tanked. Believe me I feel it everyday. But as you may remember, being a former educator, teachers are already grossly underpaid. To sign this bill now is a slap in our face.
 I have been an EC teacher in Cumberland County for nearly 24 years and I cannot begin to count the amount of money that I have spent in my classroom over these years. I buy materials and supplies to keep my students engaged, because we do not have books. The workbooks that I am currently using were originally copyrighted in 1981. That's pathetic!
And now you take more away from us and suggest that 10 hours of leave time will compensate for that. We also received information yesterday that our State Health Plan benefits are being cut. Boy, talk about "getting it from both sides"! I use this blunt language out of frustration for myself, my colleagues and my students.
As I said in my previous email you have GREATLY let us all down! I am sure it will be difficult to look us in the eye when you have to face us.
I am certain that I will hear from your office this time. Please do not continue to let us down. Teachers are our state's greatest asset and resource. YOU NEED US!!!!

Thank you,
Alison Boney, Teacher

Governor Purdue,
Shame on you for your decision to cut state employees pay to help to resolve the current economic woes of the state. Did you really think this out, or was this the easiest fix to the problem. We already have a problem recruiting and keeping good teachers in NC, this action will not help. I am truly disappointed with this decision and am sure it will come back to haunt you during the next election.

Governor Bev Perdue,

I understand the need for everyone to pitch in and help during tough times. I would have no problem giving up a 1/2% per month of my salary to help the budget. But, here is the problem, my wife and I both are teachers so we are going to lose about $500.00 from our May check. How are we going to pay our bills? This is too much to ask from teachers who already stressed from all the testing coming up plus all the other bad news about the economy.

Dear Governor:

As a teacher in the Asheville City School System, I feel it is my responsibility to speak up to strongly against your “flexible furlough plan”.  I realize you inherited this unbelievable and inexcusable 3 BILLION DOLLAR budget “shortfall”.  But, I don’t see how it can be legal to cut teachers salaries for this year.  We have a signed contract that says it is binding through the end of the school year.  How can you change the terms of that contract at this late date?  This amount needs to be deducted from our pay in the 2008/09 fiscal year which means by June.  We have only 1 paycheck left in this time period, so I assume the entire amount will have to come out of that one paycheck.  Some of us are living pay check to pay check and this will be a hardship.  As far as the 10 hours of unpaid leave we will be forced to take, that will be covered under the next contract and is easier to absorb.

I do understand that these are difficult times and I am grateful to have a job.  I understand and accept we all have to make sacrifices to get through this.  I do however question the merits and legality of this decision.  There must be a better way.

Sincerely,

Penny Lewis

Govenor Purdue,

It continues to amaze me at the way our government is maintained.  We continue to waste money based on the allocations of funds.  Schools spend money in a frivolous mannner in order not to have it taken back, yet we have fewer resources.  Testing is most definitely not seeing a reduction, but it is a huge expense that for the most part doesn't predict the success of students.  Of course, I'm positive their will not be any compensation if my students do well.  Where are the lottery funds?  Can't some of the transportation projects be delayed in an attempt to educate our future.  This just seems like another quick easy fix.   I regret voting for you.

I'm sure most elected officials will not participate in the salary cut.  You say you will, but listen you make substantially more than the employees' salaries you are cutting.

I wonder how the state would handle the school systems if every teacher just decided to stay home for a day.  You might see how valuable we are.  Maybe the first or last day of testing would be a good day.

It should be noted that my last dollar has been spent for my classroom.  I will no longer compensate for what the state doesn't provide which is a lot.  I feel compelled to cut back.  

I'm sure I will receive absolutely no response to this e-mail, but you were once a teacher in eastern NC and I thought you would like to know you are setting education back at least 15 years.  Congratulations on your achievement.

As much as you regret your legislation, I regret my vote for you.

Dear Governor Purdue,
I am a teacher in the state of North Carolina and am severely effected, as are many others by your recent decision. I am currently a 10 month employee, which means that my pay cut will come out of 1 check in a greater lump sum. This will mean that my check will be significantly lower, resulting in financial distress in my household. I am fully aware that I am not the only one who this will impact in this way and strongly feel there could have been other measures taken to try and resolve the budget issue. Furthermore, as a teacher I am unable to simply take 10 hours of time off without having to pay for a substitute   to be in my classroom. Thus resulting in loosing more money out of my check, in order to take advantage of the Furlough time. It is extremely frustrating to hear that bankers are getting bonus checks while we are loosing money that we signed a CONTRACT stating we would receive for our employment. It is very upsetting that teachers are some of the lowest paid employees of the state, who often struggle from paycheck to paycheck and are now going to be loosing some of what little we do make. I am curious as to what sort of cut your salary will be taking and why the employees of the state who make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year can't have their salaries made smaller so that those of us who make less money don't have to be affected.
I have recently made a decision to move to another state and after this pay cut decision I am glad that I had decided to move. I have lived in NC my whole life and never would have imagined that I would leave with such negative feelings.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Davis

  I wanted to personally thank you for the 10 hours of flex time that I will never be able to take. It is difficult for a teacher to take 10 hours of flex time when they already work 50 hours a week. Giving of their own time in order to educate children.
  I was livid this morning when you stated, " Teachers need to do their part." We have been doing more with less for years.

First of all I want to say that I voted for you in the election!
Would you mind explaining the ten hour furlough?
How is a teacher expected to take a ten hour furlough?  Will we get substitute teachers to come in?  Won't substitute teachers have to be paid?
OR....are we expected to take our ten hour furlough on a much needed teacher workday?
I have many ideas on how we can save money in education if you would like to contact me.
Thank you for responding to this e-mail!

Governor Perdue,

It is with great concern that I'm taking time to address your most recent furlough plan. First of all I would like to say how surprised I am by your actions. I don't remember this being addressed to the people of North Carolina when you were running for office. You were going to make things better for teacher's in our state and that was one of the main reasons I voted for you.  I can sympathize with the citizens of North Carolina who have lost their jobs due to our failing economy. I myself was one of those people seven years ago. I live in Surry County North Carolina and our county is in the worst shape ever. I worked in textiles for sixteen years and when the company I worked for closed the doors I went back to school and received my BS in Education. I'm forty years old and have two sons and my husband works out of town each week in another state to provide for our family. I borrowed money to earn my degree and now you are taking money out of my pay check. The money being taken away from me is money that pays my student loan. Maybe your office should pay back loans for teachers. Or maybe anyone who wishes to become a teacher could go to college free. There are women and men in our state now that have teaching degrees and can't buy a job. That is a sad situation. I hope that you will think long and hard before making any more decisions that take money away from teachers. I can remember President George W. Bush made the statement that if our country didn't have teachers we wouldn't have doctors, lawyers, and politicians. You and your staff need to think about that. Also remember that the children of our state are our future and without teachers teaching them, where would we be.

Sincerely,

Governor Perdue,
     For someone who likes to call herself an education governor, you sure are not doing anyone in education a favor by reducing their pay.  Teacher assistants, like myself, already struggle to make ends meet.  I could make more money working out in the private sector than by providing a very valuable service to a special student (although with the job market so bad that is almost impossible to do right now).  Cutting the pay of educational personnel is pretty much like a dog biting the hand that feeds it!
     I hope you will reconsider this move.  It is something I think would be the last thing that should be done in these times when everbody is wanting more out of students.  As for the furlough, it is something that does not do me much good.  It is not easy for me to take time off because of what I do.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am a teacher with the Buncombe county schools.  My husband works with the drug treatment program in the prisons.  While I understand the need for the .5% reduction in pay and the unpaid 10 days furlough, I am wondering if YOU are taking the pay cut and the unpaid furlough...are the other elected officials is Raleigh taking the pay cut and unpaid furlough. 

If you are that is great.  In that case I support your decision completely.   May I suggest that you let the state employees, teachers and general public know this. It is the opinion of many that you are making us give up pay, while the officials in Raleigh are acting like the CEOs in the banking industry, keeping your salaries and life styles intact.

If you are not, shame on you.  I don't support the cut in my family's pay while my elected officials keep my tax dollars for their own pockets.  The public needs to know this too...and I am sure someone will eventually let them know.

Thank you for your time and service,

Good morning Gov. Perdue,

     I wanted to take a moment to express my disappointment with the decision you have made about the 0.5% salary reduction.  I understand we are facing hard economic issues and we, as the citizens of the state of North Carolina, need to help.  However, I do not feel that having teachers take a pay cut on their last check before summer (traditional employees) is the way to do that.  I would find it feasible to take 0.5% spread over all 10 paychecks that we receive, but many teachers that I work with budget their summer funds based on the last paycheck.  I know you proudly support teachers and education and that is why I voted for you.  This decision has me feeling otherwise, though.  We are shaping the future generation and I take great pride in doing so, but when a large chunk of money is taken out of just one check, it really hurts my family.  Please take this into consideration when trying to decide the specifics on how this is going to be done.  Thank you for your time and commitment to the state of North Carolina. 

Sincerely,
Beth Selig

Governor Perdue,

I have been a teacher for sixteen years; I am a North Carolina Teaching Fellow; and I am a parent of a child enrolled in a NC public school. Most importantly I am very demoralized and discouraged by your recent decision to affect my contracted rate of pay, as well as the pay of all other state employees.

The first questions that came to my mind when I heard of these cuts were 'are the salaries of the legislators and Governor Perdue also being cut?' and 'wasn't Perdue a former teacher?'.

I would appreciate an answer to the first question, with an amount of salary reduction for those state employees (governor and legislators), and an explanation of how a former educator could do this to an entire profession of educators that is already sadly underpaid in comparison to other states and all other professionals?

Several fellow teachers on my hallway this morning at my school have jokingly suggested that perhaps we should all take our "flexible furlough" hours on the first day of school next year--or maybe one of the EOG testing days coming up.  Not only would this affect the education of our state's young people, but shut down most of the state's day to day business workings as all North Carolinians with children seek to find other day care arrangements.

Seriously.  Is this how I am repaid for my vote for Bev Perdue?  Is this all the thanks I get for the job I do each day, educating our young people?  Is this really an effective way to recoup $3 billion dollars in debt?

I am very disappointed in this decision and it will affect my vote in the next election.  You have shown how little you value my profession, other critical jobs in law enforcement that I find essential, and most of all you  have shown how little you value my vote.

Sincerely, 
Kelly Deese

Governor Perdue,



It states in your bio on your website that you were a former teacher.  Your platform for running included, that you would be “fighting for world-class public schools” and be “committed to attracting and retaining the best teachers in America.”



The fact that teachers supported you, voted for you and probably won you the title of being our states first woman governor, shocks me that you have taken the steps to cut their pay. 



How is it that you think you can attract and retain the best teachers for the students of North Carolina if you are cutting teachers pay, teachers that do their best to teach our future?  By taking money from teachers, you are taking away our investment in our state’s future.



My mother has been a teacher for 28 years.  If she had an average class of 20 students, she has touched the lives of 560 children; 560 people that have gone on to learn, work, create families.  That’s for just one teacher!  That one teacher who makes enough pay check to pay check to survive.  Answer me how we pay college football players, Chancellors, Superintendents, Board Members, etc millions, yet a single teacher who spends 180 days with each child, nurturing them and giving them the tools to survive life is paid (according to the 2008-2009 Salary Schedule) between $30,430-51,530.  Does this seem logical?  Without teachers we would not have lawyers, bankers, marketers, social workers, artist, doctors, etc.; if every teacher stopped caring, stopped working, where would we be?



I am extremely disappointed in myself to have supported you as Governor and in you for making this detrimental decision that will have no positive outcome for the ONLY people that keep our state going.



Thank you,

Jennifer R. Maltba

                        How in the world can you say in your letter to cut pay for our educators that this is working together for a bright future? Did you cut your pay and that of your staff? Did you apologize to the voters and say you need to close your Charlotte office because of economic times and will reopen when it makes more sense to spend the state's money that way? My daughter is in the 3rd grade and her teacher told me yesterday that his pay would be cut but his wife who lost her job about 6 months ago got an increase in her unemployment check. Help me make sense of that. Of all things to try to balance your budget with the salaries of those who teach our citizens of tomorrow and who are already under paid as it is. If you can explain this away Mrs. Perdue, I'd like to hear it. Otherwise, shame on you.

Governor Perdue,

I am deeply saddened by your recent decision to reduce the wages of our state employees. I watched the broadcast of your announcement last night and couldn’t help but detect a distinct look of guilt on your face. It wasn’t the same confident face I watched in campaign videos and news bites. It wasn’t the same face I watched tell of a humble background of hard working parents. It was the face of a woman that has failed her office for which she was elected. I did not vote for you, but if I had, I would be ashamed to say that I did at this point. Even though I didn’t, I held out hope that you would be a different kind of leader. I do not understand why you should feel it necessary to take away salary from our state employees who work so hard to help provide a better life for all North Carolinians. Wasn’t the NC State Education Lottery supposed to create enough revenue to cover education costs? And if so, why were our teachers not exempt from this pay cut? Also, if the state emergency fund is over $700 billion as printed, why would we not be able to use that money? Is an economic depression not considered an emergency? God help us if it’s not! I know there are federal laws governing many things on a state level but are we not free as North Carolinians to balance our own budget and appropriate funds as we see fit? After all, it IS OUR money! I think that is the one thing you and your office need to remember. We depend on our salaries, as you do, and suffer when they are reduced. You have taken away money that could have benefited our state in many ways. We have already waited much longer than appropriate for our NC state income tax refunds because state officials say that we have a “cash flow” problem. Again, where are the emergency funds?  If North Carolinians can’t pay their bills and support their families, there will be no North Carolina to call home.

I am not a public employee but my daughter-in-law is a teacher’s assistant at Yadkinville  Elementary School. My son is a police officer for the city of Winston-Salem and my husband is a deputy sheriff for the County of  Davie. WE BELIVE IN NORTH CAROLINA!!  I think it’s time you did.

Sincerely,



Brenda Sloan

                        A user with email address of Roy.Patterson@MecklenburgCountyNC.gov submitted the following question. 



                        I feel that is  inappropriate to cut teachers pay and order time off without pay. If they would get rid of all the mandated testing, which prevents teachers from actually doing their job, a good deal of the deficiate could be eleminated.  The future of North Carolina depends on our students. This only short changes the students and the state. With all the testing and the "ABC's" the teachers have to teach to the test because if their students do poorlely they are held accountable; nothing is said about the student wanting to learn or the parents who are not suportave. It is always only the teachers fault.  Education is not a business and it cannot be operated as one or tested as one.  Students are not "widdigts" or machines to measure how many items they can produce.  Please reconsider.   If you continue in this vain I doubt you will get any teachers votes at next election.

Why does our newly elected governor believe it is okay to take money out of state employee’s paychecks to make up for a budget deficit?  Shouldn’t we simply cut back on the amount of money we are spending on various programs during tough times?  It’s not like we’re overpaying state employees in the first place.  I think we should protect the jobs and pay of those people who are willing to show up to work everyday and put their heart and soul into what they do.  This is a short term fix for a long term problem.  As our elected leaders you guys need to find ways to be more fiscally responsible.  This means cutting out wasteful pork barrel spending, not cutting the pay of those who are already underpaid for the tasks they perform.  The whole concept of incrementalism in the budget process needs to be thrown out the window.  Why is it that every single government agency and program we have needs more money every year?  I’ll tell you why, it’s because we expect our government to do way too much.  The whole process makes me sick.  Watching those in power scramble to spend money at the end of a fiscal year simply because they know they won’t get that money next year if they don’t spend it this year is also disgusting.  Whatever happened to saving for a rainy day?  Parents across America try to instill in their children the importance of saving, yet our elected leaders act like it’s a foreign concept. The sad fact is that we’ll never see our taxes decreased because you guys are determined to spend every single penny you can get your hands on.   Heaven forbid you tell one of your constituents “no”.  How about you do the right thing, not the thing you think will get you reelected.

April 29, 2009

Governor Beverly Perdue,

I am shocked that you are cutting NC teachers salaries for the rest of this school year. I thought you supported strong educational practices and teachers. Most NC teachers are struggling as it is with our low salaries. I personally work 3 jobs to make ends meet and have 28 years of teaching experience. What about the principals, county office employees and superintendent's salaries? Will these be cut as well? What if these employees are paid from local funds? Will these individuals have their salaries cut too? How about all the NC Senators, House members and even you, our Governor, will you give up your salary for a month? We, the working citizens of NC, pay for your home while you are in office, why not give up your salary for just a month? I doubt you live from paycheck to paycheck like most teachers do. I am appalled that you would do this to teachers who are counting on their regular salary's to cover them over the summer months when they are unemployed. This is hurting a group of people which you have control over, state employees. What about the rest of the working individuals in NC? You can't cut their pay so state employees must suffer for all. How about cutting off welfare, food stamps, unemployment or some other hand-out services for a month to recoup some money? Why punish the individuals who work for the State?
I understand we are in an economic crisis but, you are forcing NC state teachers to suffer for the entire state's economic problems. What an abuse of power to individuals you claimed to support and an eye opener to who you really are and what you stand for. I was a strong supporter of you during the election but, these tactics are wrong, unfair and putting state employees in a position where we will greatly suffer this summer.
This, Governor Perdue, is wrong and hitting individuals who need and depend on their summer money to carry them through. We work hard for every penny we earn and do not have time to scrimp to save for stolen wages by our governor so close to summer break.What are you doing besides kicking state employees when we are already down with the lack of supplies, positions cut and crowded classrooms. Do we get this punishment because you are the head of the state and you CAN do this to us? Shame on you Governor Perdue! You are not who I voted for or supported in this past election.

A very disappointed teacher and former Perdue supporter,

Michele Riviere Bridges

Dear Governor,



What are you thinking when you take funds from the education lottery and then put a pay cut in place for teachers who work 24x7 to try to increase proficiency for our students.  Not only are you stating what you think of education and educators but you are providing a venue for a mass exodus of dedicated teachers.  I'm so disappointed in a person that ran on improving education.  Obviously just a ploy to win election.
