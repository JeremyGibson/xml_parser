Dear Governor Perdue,

I urge you to step in and fight the Senate's budget proposal,
which would destroy "More at Four," one of the country's most
highly rated pre-kindergarten programs. Especially given this
economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality
pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human
capital -- starting with its youngest citizens.

Children and families urgently need you to speak out against the
Senate proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, which
would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at
Four. North Carolina voters and the nation, having heard your
support of high-quality pre-k in your State of the State
address, are watching.

North Carolina has been a national leader on early education,
and "More at Four" is one of only two state pre-k programs in
the country that meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by
the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER).
Please ensure that pre-k in North Carolina does not regress
under your watch and remains a fiscal priority in our state.

Sincerely,


Fiona Ireland

> Six Economic Recovery Workshops Announced

Gov. Perdue this week announced that the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold a series of workshops across the state to provide information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. The first workshop is scheduled for April 28 at 1:30 p.m. in Winston-Salem State University’s Dillard Auditorium.

> Workshop attendees will have an opportunity to hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds. These representatives will discuss the current status of funds in their agencies, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

> “North Carolina is set to receive more than $8 billion in federal recovery money, and I intend for our state to not only be prepared to use this money to put our people back to work but also to spend the money with the utmost accountability and transparency,” said Gov. Perdue. “These workshops will build the bridges between state, local and county governments – and anyone else interested in utilizing recovery funds – to ensure this money is used to benefit all of North Carolina and our people.”

> OERI Director Dempsey Benton will lead the workshops. “The economic recovery funds are purpose-driven, rather than place-driven,” he said. “It’s important that attendees understand the funded programs so they may actively participate. It’s also important for participants to understand the expectations for efficiency, transparency and accountability in the investment of funds.”

> Additional workshops will be held in Asheville, Charlotte, Greenville, Raleigh and Wilmington in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. For additional information visit <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov. 

> State Board of Education and DPI to Intervene in Halifax County Schools

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the State Board of Education Chair and CEO Bill Harrison, State Superintendent June Atkinson, the board and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction will begin an unprecedented intervention in Halifax County Schools, one of the low-performing school districts in the state. 

> "My goal is to improve public schools and student performance," said Gov. Perdue.  "Dr. Harrison, Superintendent Atkinson and I will act aggressively in Halifax County and all of North Carolina to make sure our schools have the support, direction and accountability that give our kids a chance to succeed."

> Under the intervention plan, NCDPI staff will provide intensive support and oversight to coach principals in effective instructional and school leadership, to provide tools to help central office personnel better guide the school district, and ensure that teachers get the necessary support and resources needed to improve student learning.

> “Halifax Superintendent Geraldine Middleton has been receptive to us and we look forward to helping her and her team move forward,” said Harrison. “This intervention is a partnership with Halifax County Schools, and one in which the state board and education department will guide professional development and create a supportive framework with one goal:  improved student learning and achievement.”

> Activities already have begun in Halifax but will intensify this summer and in the 2009-10 school year.  Clear expectations and direction will be provided to local leadership, principals and teachers. Three weeks of professional development will be provided to all Halifax principals and central office personnel, and two weeks of professional development will be provided to teachers in the Halifax schools over the summer. This activity will kick off the 2009-10 school year and provide clear expectations and direction for educators in the district and schools.

>> UPDATE - Friday, April 24: 

>> Governor Bev Perdue today cleared her calendar to make an unannounced visit to Dawson Elementary and Southeast Halifax High schools in Halifax County.  She met with the principals, teachers and students, and observed a classroom of her choosing at each school.

>> “It was important to me to get a first-hand look at the schools in Halifax County,” said Gov. Perdue.  “The state will work with local education leaders to maximize efforts to improve student achievement.  Strong leaders, strong teachers and strong community support can make the difference. ”

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a Pre-K teacher in the More @4 program in one of the NC public schools.  I have recently read the proposed legislation and budget cuts for the upcoming year.  I must say as a parent of a pre-schooler and a public educator that I disagree with the cuts to the youngest student population.  This program has helped countless students enter Kindergarten ready to learn.  Cutting the funding will cause us to limit this service to the poverty level community that we serve.  It will also mean that students who need to be screened and identified for Exceptional Children's services will slip through the cracks.

I have been in education for almost 10 years now.  I used to teach 1st grade lower level students.  I saw the struggles that some children made daily.  I knew that they could have done better only if someone had intervened sooner.  The first years of a child's life are the most impressionable ones of their lives.  This is when they can easily learn a second language, make friends that look and act differently than just their family, and lay a foundation that will prepare them to receive an education and enter society as a productive citizen.  


Our pre-K program doesn't prepare these children by teaching them their ABC's, 123's, shapes and colors.  Our program takes students from at risk homes and encourages them to learn a better way.  We teach students how to respect teachers, students and administrators.  They learn how to follow a routine and classroom discipline so that Kindergarten is not emotionally and academically overwhelming.  They start out learning that education is fun, exciting, and useful.  Their parents are involved in education workshops, parent conferences, and school events.  They are proud to see their child(ren)growing in knowledge because they know that it will lead to a brighter future for them and America.

You may not see the results just yet because this program has only been in existence for the past decade.  Some of the first students have not had the opportunity to graduate from High School yet.  I do think that our program is helping K-2 teachers get students who are ready to learn and in turn is able to produce better readers and problem solvers.  Who then move on to the 3-5 teachers that can take these independent learners to the next level and teach to the individual student's needs. This also allows the state's EOG test scores to rise.  As these students continue on through to the 12th grade, they begin to focus on a trade/job or a college education.  Both of which have been the strength in America's work force throughout the 20th century.

Now that we are in the 21st century, the economic tide has turned.  If the cuts that you are suggesting go through, then I feel as though the state has not valued my work as an educator and that my efforts have been in vain.  I love my job and I love my student's as though they were my own.  I have spent countless dollars of coins that I have thrown in a jar on little extras that bring my lessons to life.  I am already struggling with my own family.  I am the sole income of the household.  My husband lost his job in December.  I have three children, one of which has Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD.  Even on a teacher's salary, we qualify for NC health choice.  Times are tough for everyone.

North Carolina has been my home since birth.  I am proud to have attended the Nation's top school of education at Greensboro College.  I am happy to see the progress that we are making in public education at the early stages.  I am simply asking that you seriously consider budget cuts at some other places rather than the pre-k programs.  My colleagues and I can see the need to not open any new classrooms just yet; nonetheless, are these drastic cuts to our end of the system necessary?  Let's hold tight to what we have and continue to strengthen our educational system so that we can have citizens that can work for America in the future. 

I know that you have to make a tough decision.  Thank you for taking time to consider my concerns as both a citizen and an employee of North Carolina.  I pray you will make wise decisions about my family's future.

Sincerely,

Michelle A. Tuttle
