Subject: Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy

Comment: As a member of the coastal wind working group I was sent a copy of the slides presented at the Buxton offshore wind meeting the other week. I was a little disappointed that the consultants in charge of the offshore platforms section of the report omitted a long-proven method of supporting equipment in an offshore environment. It is also the least expensive. I contacted Harvey Seim who presented the slides at the Buxton meeting so he could comment for the panel. See below. Re: Offshore Platforms Tuesday, September 29, 2009 1:39 AM From: "Harvey Seim" To: "Robert Getchell" "You are correct, the Dutch firm who suggested appropriate foundation designs did not consider this one. Thanks for pointing it out." Harvey Titan 200 Offshore Wind Platform This platform can be set up in depths of up to 200 feet, without the use of pilings or jack-up barges. The oil industry has been using the Titan 200 Platform in offshore oil fields for decades. Recently one of the original designers, Doug Hines of Offshore Wind Platforms of Texas, modified the design for wind turbine applications. A major advantage is all assembly takes place in port. When the three deck platform is towed out of port, with a turbine already erected on the top deck, it is a registered vessel. Once in place the three legs are lowered to the bottom, ballast tanks are filled, the footings settle 8-12 feet into the bottom, and are then covered with concrete matting for scour protection. Once leveled the platform is jacked up 60 feet above the ocean surface. J-tubes in the legs carry cable from the seabed to the switching disconnects and other equipment inside the platform. The Titan platforms survived the category 5 winds of Katrina a few years ago, with no damage. MMS has certified the design for offshore use in US waters. Using a platform is cheaper than a piling, and environmental impacts from construction, assembly and decommissioning are virtually eliminated. For an additional cost, decks can be retrofitted to carry additional equipment, house crew and there is also a desalinization system that is made for the Titan 200 platform. We looked at Cape Winds proposal, talked to a lot of the designers and environmental consultants who worked on the project, even met with Doug Hines in DC where he had been called to speak before a congressional panel about these wind platforms. Any offshore project we pursue will use the Titan 200 Wind Platform. We are focusing on acquisition of Frying Pan Shoals tower to get an offshore site in a prime wind location. If USACE will allow us to turn the old tower into an artificial reef we'll replace the old tower with a new Titan 200 on the same lease site. I encourage you to google up Offshore Wind Platforms of Texas. I'm sure Doug can answer any questions you or anyone else may have. There is also some cost comparison information on the site that is useful. Sincerely, Bob Getchell Noreaster Energy Partners

Subject: The Equipment Industry is in a Depression: Act Now!

Comment: Harold Marvin 1010 Atando Ave Charlotte, NC 28206-2251 October 23, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to urge you to work with your colleagues to enact legislation that will assist the construction equipment industry recover from the terrible economic situation the industry is currently facing. While other sectors of the U.S. economy appear to be recovering from the recession, the construction equipment industry remains mired in a deep depression. On September 29, the Associated Equipment Distributors (AED) and the Associated Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) released the results of an equipment industry economic condition. Among the key findings: ï¿½ The construction equipment industry - which includes manufacturing, distribution and maintenance companies - has shed a staggering 37 percent of its workforce since the equipment market peaked in 2006. By comparison, auto manufacturing and dealership jobs are down by 16 percent, while job losses in the finance and insurance industry amount to 6 percent of their workforce. ï¿½ Spending on construction equipment has fallen by more than 50 percent compared to its peak in 2006. ï¿½ The economic output of this industry has contracted by nearly 40 percent and resulted, directly and indirectly, in the loss of approximately 550,000 jobs. In other words, eight percent of all jobs lost since the start the recession have been associated with the equipment industry downturn. ï¿½ Over the course of the recession, losses to industry sales and employment have decimated the taxes paid on employee income, corporate profits and sales of machinery; the magnitude of the decline indicates that taxes revenues associated with our industry have fallen by $12.8 billion. Without significant congressional action, the construction industry economic crisis will continue for the foreseeable future and prevent recovery in the broader economy. In order to assist the construction equipment industry recover from the depression it is in, I urge Congress to quickly pursue the following legislative initiatives to create new construction industry jobs and revitalize the construction equipment industry. ï¿½ Invest in critical infrastructure by swiftly passing multi-year reauthorization bills that increase investment in the nation's highways, public transportation, bridges, sewers, drinking water systems, and airports. To pay for investment in the highway program, Congress should support a user fee increase, the fairest and most fiscally responsible way to pay for additional revenue. Many leading business groups support a user fee increase, including AED, AEM, AAA, the American Trucking Associations, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ï¿½ Ensure that credit is available to equipment distributors, manufacturers, purchasers, and to developers. The construction industry is facing an unprecedented credit crisis. Congress and the executive branch must work together to put programs in place to ensure that dealers and manufacturers have access to capital to run their companies, that customers can get credit to buy equipment, and that developers can access the money they need to undertake new construction projects. ï¿½ Extend and expand the home purchase tax credit. ï¿½ Extend the stimulus bill's capital investment incentives and create new tax credits to encourage "clean diesel" equipment purchases. ï¿½ Extend and expand net operating loss (NOL) carry back rules. Congress should allow 2009 losses to be carried back for five years and significantly raise the eligibility cap for companies to take advantage of NOL carry-back benefits. I urge you to strongly consider the aforementioned proposals. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, H.W. Marvin III 7043330786

While the govenor was running for office of she repeadedly promised to freeze property taxes owned by senior citizens. This would only involve primary resistence. To date she has failed to mention much less act as promised. Needless to say I am a retired senior citizen who's property taxes last year were raised approx 35%. Leaving on a fixed income and having expenses like these make it more than inpossible to make ends met. If your promise is not kept it may be a reality that we can not continue to keep our home. I like many others need to know what is going to be done to correct this concern for seniors and will you make good on your pre election promise. I hope to hear from you. I also hope my vote was not given to the wrong canidate and that you will follow through as promised.

Comment: as the wave of medicinal marijuana legalization slowly spreads across the USA. and with NC haveing the Delivery system in place all ready for the ABC stores. NC could piggy back the sale of medicinal marijuana into the ABC stores. at a HUGE cost savings.of not haveing to lay out money to set up stores.. its just some thing to think about.with privatizing the ABC system the state might lose a outlet to control the sale of medicinal marijuana...

Subject: Proposed boat launch for Hampstead

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: I don't have all of the details but I have heard that there is a possibility that you may authorize the development of a new boat launch in Hampstead. I think it is on the property of the old 12 Oaks Marina off the Sloop Point Rd. I just want to say I very much support this idea. It has become difficult to find a place to launch a boat in this area as many of the old launch sites have been sold for development. I used to use the 12 Oaks launch on a both an annual fee basis and a per launch use fee. It is in a good area for most of us in this town. I think people would even support a launch fee if that is what it would take to make this happen. Since the property was closed to the public a few months ago, we do not have a launch close by. Thanks for your consideration. Sincerely- Sean Day Hampstead

Subject: Tax on Bread (Give us our daily!)

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing in reference to the 71/2% tax imposed on bread baked in-house. If I go into Bi-lo, or any other store for that matter, and purchase two loaves of bread, one pre-packed at a plant somewhere the other baked in the store, I am charged 1% on the dollar for the pre-packed and 71/2% on the dollar for the one baked in the store. So, if you have a member of your household who is allergic to or doesn't like the packaged bread you are forced to pay more for the bakery bread. It is almost impossible to find pre-packed bread in the U.S. that doesn't contain sweeteners!!! Bread should not be taxed like a meal, a sandwich, a doughnut etc. People take it home to consume. These are hard times and to tax families on BREAD could be described as a sin (especially in the South, note the Lord's Prayer and all the other biblical references). A small matter you might say: I don't think so. Families and old people survive on bread, beans and leftovers in hard times. Yours very truly, Julia A. Tomlinson

Attn: Governor Perdue

This past year I had sent you information on your site, but apparently its get diverted to other departments and you may have not even read the information.

I was down at the Cumberland County Courthouse and there are to many Homes either in foreclosure or up for Aution after foreclosure.

I visited the local Unemployment Office and still too many people applying for Unemployment.

Project/Program "Unemployment To Business" can help with those out of work.

Project/Program "Consolidated Debt Mortgage" can help homeowners clear their debt, reduce payment on mortgage 2% fixed 30 years/40years.

Useing both programs can prevent foreclosures and provide work for those homeowners desiring to stay in their homes.

Both Programs require Recycling Tax Dollars Funding.

We have sent you Information on One or Both programs.


But have heard nothing of a positive response.


I would thing as Governor you would be more concerned of those you Lead.

As of Febuary 1, 2010, Both Programs will nolonger be offer to NC.

NC can be put to work using our State's own Resources...........

Thank you!  I wish you & your family a happy new year, too.

As for my big dream, maybe you can help me with it, since its something I've only run into since I've moved to North Carolina.

I built my house on a lot on Salem Chapel Road, 1/2 mile south of the Stokes County line, so its physically located in Forsyth County.  From the time I purchased the lot & my realtor mistakenly requested Stokes County Health Department to do the tests for the well, there has been confusion about who does what & what services I'm entitled to. For example:

1.   Forsyth County assessed my house. I pay them property tax on both my house & car.
    - When I called for garbage pick-up with Waste Management, they said they don't do pick-up at this end of the road.  Yet, I see their trucks travel it at least twice a day.
       (Because I had to contract with Rural Garbage Service,
        who doesn't do recycling, I spent an hour on the web
        researching who to call, etc.,  When I called the
        Forsyth County recycling center closest to me (in
        Kernersville) I was told they only service as far as
        Walkertown & was given another number to call.
        Well, 4 different numbers & calls later, I was
        referred back to the same guy who said it didn't
        matter that I paid taxes to Forsyth County, my
        zip code is Walnut Cove & thats Stokes County.)

2.  As an AARP volunteer advocate who worked to pass Health Care Reform, I met with the representatives of my district - based on my residence in Forsyth County, even though my mailing address is Walnut Cove in Stokes County.  Sen. Brunstetter had no problem understanding my position, but Rep. Falwell sent me a rather brusque note saying I had errouneously contacted him when
I should have contact the Rep. from Stokes County.  Neither Mr. Falwell, nor Sen. Brunstetter told me which law, ordinance . . . whatever the correct term might be, is the one that needs to be changed so things can be handled more effectively & efficiently.

Its my understanding the current law reads that a mailing address is determined by how close a new residence is to an existing PO.   

Here's the solution - just add these words:  IN THE SAME COUNTY AS THE RESIDENCE

This point of frustration has really been brought home to me  since I started work in the Winston-Salem Local Census Office.  Several people have called into our office to be scheduled to take the tests for employment opportunities whose physical, residence address is in one county, but who when asked for their zip code have given one that shows on the map for another county, so have been told to call the Local Census Office for that zip code.  This is not right!  The person physically lives, pays taxes, votes, etc. in one county, but will be enumerated in another county.  The latter county will get the benefit of that count with their taxes, representation, grants, etc.

Whether its to help NC residents like myself who have to spend hours, days, weeks, months "fighting City Hall" just to get what is rightfully ours via our paid taxes lower our blood pressure, or the right county to have its residents counted, I'm hoping someone in your office can look into this matter & get it resolved so we can all "do the right thing".

After all, you did say to dream big!

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Cindy  ( Cyd )   Dunne

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!
The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 
The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.
With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 
Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!

Thank you for such a timely response to my email.  How different this administration is compared to the prior governor; I am impressed with your attention to my pressing matter.  Hopefully the Governor will find some improvement in our litter problem; I suggest she contact the Governor of Connecticut who made it a priority in her administration and has done such an incredible job of cleaning up her roadways; she may have some helpful recommendations.  I suggest our state make a concerted effort to fine offenders who have pickup trucks, etc with debris flying out of them when they are on their way to a dumpsite.  Hwy 1 near 64 is a disgrace  check it out, you wont believe your eyes.  And whats up with the Glenwood exit off of Hwy 1; every time I go to the Crabtree Mall I am shocked by the amount of litter on the exit ramps.  I also no longer hear any Public Service Announcements regarding litter  we need to make it known that we want a clean state like Texas does in such an effective manner. Good luck, Patricia Lloyd

I agree the past year was one that has brought our attention to the issue at hand.  I would like to first explain I am a North Carolina State employee and I understand we have a financial hardship in North Carolina and the rest of the country, What I would like to express is that you have seen fit to apply the debt to the State employee's and to forget about the other 900,000 people living in this state.   As well you have exempted the elected officials and I can't understand why, there being paid by the state of North Carolina so If this is true they are a STATE EMPLOYEE but not required to pay out of there hard earned money.  And if you decided to apply a one time fee to every person in this state a fee of $5.00 per person and this equals what $450 million.  I'm not a banker so math is not my good point, but I do know the money you have taken from me has not helped me to put money back into the State, and then time off work with you taking my money just isn't right.   All I ask is if your going to apply a tax then put this on everyone in the state and keep it fair.   I have heared you say you will be appling this to everyone, but this spells double tax to me and all the other state employee's.
Please take my subject and think please.

Douglas Bannister

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Happy New Year!


	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/library/images/newsletterHeader.jpg>


Happy New Year! 

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!
The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 
The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.
With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 
Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!

Subject: 25 OCEANFRONT HOMES LOST--CALLED A NUISANCE

Comment: NAGS HEAD HOMES DAMAGED BY THE NOV. 09 NOR EASTER-- A NUISANCE !!! WHAT A SHAME. SOMEONE DREAM'S OF OWNING A BEACH HOME. THEIR DREAM BECOMES A REALITY AND THEN A NUISANCE. JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN LIFE NEEDS MAINTENANCE. YOU CHANGE THE FLUID IN YOUR VEHICLE, MOW YOUR LAWN, WASH YOUR CLOTHING. I COULD GO ON AND ON. WHY NOT BEACH REFURBISHMENT? EVERY RENTAL HOME LOST FROM THE SHORE IS LOST DREAMS FOR THE HOME OWNER AND LOST REVENUE FOR THE COUNTY. THE RENTAL HOMES DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ATTEND SCHOOL HERE. THE RENTAL HOMES ALONG THE SHORE BRING IN THE MOST RENTERS TAX. THE RENTAL HOME TENANTS LEAVE A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF THEIR INCOME HERE. WHY NOT HAVE BEACH REFURBISHMENT TO SAVE DREAMS, REVENUE, TOURIST MEMORIES? WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SOUR PEOPLE HERE THAT THINK WE SHOULD NOT HELP SAVE ALL OF THE ABOVE? WHY ARE WE SO NEGATIVE TO HELPING PRESERVE THE HOMES IN PERIL? I GREW UP HERE. EVERY HOME THAT WE LOSE IS MORE OF THE OUTER BANKS HISTORY GONE. WHY NOT PROTECT AND PRESERVE. THE PENNY TAX WAS FOR BEACH REFURBISHMENT. THE PENNY TAX WAS ON PREPARED FOOD ONLY. THE PENNY TAX WOULD BE PAID FOR MAINLY BY THE TOURIST. WHEN SALES TAX GOES UP A PENNY WE SQUAK BUT DEAL WITH IT. WHY VOTE TO DEFEAT SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT MEANS NOT GOING DEEP INTO OUR POCKETS. DID WE VOTE THE MEASURE DOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WERE NOT INFORMED ? DID WE VOTE THE MEASURE DOWN BECAUSE WE COULD STOP A TAX? WE ARE ALL BLESSED TO BE LIVING HERE. I GUESS PEOPLE FORGET THAT. WAKE UP PEOPLE. IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS BE INFORMED. BE PROACTIVE.

You will find more support for it than you ever imagined and passing this bill will prove to be more beneficial to your state than a million stimulis packages. A public hearing is absolutely necessary. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Joshua Hill

Comment: It is unfair that the State of North Carolina does not support or gives option for Fertility treatments. I work for Mecklenburg County and my insurance does not cover fertility treatment or testing and we can not afford private treatments on county salary. My husband and I are very stress and desperate, please inform me of any available help the state may have. Also, please consider changing the law and allow your people to have dignity and receive the necessary services. Mecklenburg County now allows same sex partners to have health benefits they should also allow married couples fertility options. Fertility issues are not cosmetic it's a disease and it should be treated. Thank you in advance for your consideration. Sandra Abbate

Subject: smoking ban

Comment: Since it is possible for the state to pass this ban, I am here to push for common since lesgislation. It is obvious to me that the thousands of drunk drivers leaving bars and resturants in this state are far more dangerous than second hand smoke will ever be. I expect a bill to ban the consumption of alcoholic beverages in resturants and bars to be in the next session. If you are truly worried about the health and wellness of the citizens of nc this is a much more logical move than a smoking ban. If you can possibly say that second hand smoke is more dangerous than the drivers leaving these establishmnet or that the effects of alcohol on people health is less than smoking you have truly lost touch with reality. you cant have it both ways, one of these policies makes just as much since as the other. Not to mention this great stste that you govern owes a great amount of its success to the tobacco market.

Comment: On March 28, 2009, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., millions of people around the globe turned off the lights for one hour -- Earth Hour -- to make a bold statement about climate change. These millions of people were symbolically calling upon you to take action to address this enormous threat to the health of our planet and all its inhabitants. As someone greatly concerned about the impacts of climate change, I am writing to you because you have the power and ability to take concrete legislative action to fight climate change. I urge you to take action now. If you are not familiar with World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour you can find out more by going to www.EarthHourUS.org. There, you will see proof of the more than 4,000 cities in 88 countries that participated in Earth Hour 2009, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Sydney and Hong Kong. The lights went out in the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Coliseum in Rome, the Washington National Cathedral and the Sydney Opera House. Even Google's traditionally white home page went "black" for the day. Our climate is changing rapidly and already the effects are being felt. These changes will profoundly impact current and future generations people, wildlife and everything we care about. That's why I am taking action. And that's why I am urging you to do the same.

RE: Rocky Mount.  Governor Perdue, I know you have a lot on your plate but as a resident of the suburbs of Rocky Mount, I was wondering have you noticed the crime statistics, unemployment problems and the racial climate in Rocky Mount?  Rocky Mount was listed in the top "problem cities of the Nation" but the city leaders don't seem to take it seriously.  They continue to renovate areas of the city which will have no economic impact on employment and business ventures.  I think there is a problem with gangs here but no one seems to believe that notion.  Just wondering.  Thanks for your time, Diane Batts.
By the way, I am not a transplant, my family has been here forever.  My grandfather was 96 when he passed away many years ago and he was at least a second generation of the area so I have great memories of Rocky Mount and surrounding area.

Subject: Patrick Henry Caucus

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I urge you to educate yourself about the Patrick Henry Caucus and join its cause. In the Federal government's latest effort to usurp power from the states, and especially individuals, they are violating many parts of our Federal and State Constitutions. As Chief Executive of our state I expect you to be at the forefront of our defense. I trust you, as elected leader of NC, will look in to the Patrick Henry Caucus and support its cause, thereby defending our state and individual rights.

We will tax you beyond belief, impose fees of every conceivable nature upon you and eliminate as many freedoms as possible by imposing stupid laws upon you. We will screw you in every way possible, make you provide your own lubricant and tax the hell out of you when you purchase it."

Comment: Just took a trip to Dalton ,GA via I95,I20,I75 and I85 ,and NC is the only state to waste money on signage to show where watersheds start. What possible benifit could this cost ,however small,be to the average citizen of NC ? As a citizen that lives on a dirt road, that is a disgrace, I take offence to the waste in the DOT (signs, paved roads that no one lives on that dead end in farmland,etc ) that could be used on useful projects.

Comment: I certainly believe that the Western Wake Freeway (WWF) is a positive improvement for our region. However, I was disappointed to learn that the $446 million dollar contract for the 18.8 mile WWF was commissioned to a consortium of primarily out-of-state contractors; "Raleigh-Durham Roadbuilders"(RDR). To further add insult to injury; a large portion of RDRâs work is to be subcontracted to a Mississippi based construction company, "Eutaw Construction". Apparently there were no stipulations in the bid documents for utilizing N.C- based subcontractors either. I do not think that any reasonable person would conclude that RDR could not find adequate local subcontractors for this project. It has been well documented that the majority of local contractors have been forced to layoff large numbers of skilled personnel that now crowd the unemployment rolls in N.C. Furthermore, the North Carolina Turnpike Authority (NCTA) should have considered that employing N.C. based contractors would have more of a positive impact on the N.C. economy than utilizing non-NC based companies. I am certain that this âgestureâ would be viewed very positively by the citizens of N.C and would have created substantial goodwill. The NCTA needs to remember that these are the same citizens that will be paying the vast majority of the tolls on the WWF. The current economic conditions would certainly dictate that the funds generated in N.C. should be earmarked to benefit N.C. citizens, first and foremost.

Comment: How about planting trees and shrubs along all highways and medians in the state. Since you could probably get a federal grant to pay for this, as President Obama is promoting cleaning up the environment, it wouldn't cost us that much. The trees and shrubs would soak up pollution from traffic and emit oxygen. It would save the state money on mowing and equipment. It would put thousands of people to work planting them, thereby taking them off unemployment. In turn, they would be paying taxes to both state and federal treasuries, as well as putting money into the economy. If you recall, President Roosevelt put people to work in conservation and road construction as a way out of the Great Depression. Well, this is roadside conservation instead. It worked for him, why not for us. I would like to introduce this idea to the whole country, but I am not sure that President Obama would actually ever hear it if I tried to let him know. I am not sure that you will either, but I hope so. Putting a lot of people to work would really boost you ratings and that would just be icing on the cake. I hope to hear from you soon. Cordially, Barbara Lewis

Subject: Do Not close Level 3 Providers - Group Homes

Comment: I am hearing of your (the State - NC) closing the Level 3 Group Homes. These homes are valuable to the clients and society. If you close these Group Homes the children/youth can not really go 'home' because there is no 'home' to go to. Now, we are looking at society being endangered. My plea is that you reconsider maintaining the opening of these homes.

Comment: Well, let's see now. More than 160 ABC boards in NC. From their web site, it appears about two-thirds of the boards have four members, and the remainder have anywhere from three to eleven members. I estimate the average is five members. Using the New Hanover County ABC Board pay scale as a basis (although I suspect most boards are more generous), the members get $200 per month and the chairman gets $250, for a total of $1250 per month. For the more than 160 boards, that comes to $2,400,000 per year in board salaries alone. Add another $10 - 20 million for management salaries (the Williams duo from New Hanover County being exceptional) and you have upwards of twenty-million dollars or more in ABC Board and Board management salaries. LUDICROUS!!!! Now, consider that there are so few ALE agents enforcing State laws that enforcement is a virtual joke. Why?? The answer is obvious, of course. WE CAN'T AFFORD THEM, OF COURSE!!! Well, gee whiz, Mr. Wizard, I wonder if we took some of the bloated, self-serving, good-old-boy ABC management costs and applied them to hiring more ALE agents, we just might just have liquor law enforcement that has a few teeth in it.

Comment: What rocket scientist determined there is clean air in restaurants? The air in restaurants is anything but clean. Idiots! I presume since we can look forward to elimination of LP Gas, wood burning and coal next? After all we do not want to harm ourselves with carbon monoxide. What about the second hand effects of alcohol, obesity, coughing and sneezing? What we really should be outlawing is stupidity in our state government.

Subject: ABC System

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, In Sunday's News & Observer newspaper, I read an interesting editorial from one of our citizens. He proposed the idea of privatizing the ABC system to help reduce the deficit. I thought this was an outstanding idea. As the gentleman mentioned in his editorial, he suggests $1 billion or more could possibly be saved through privatization. The state wwould continue to financially benefit by receiving revenue by requiring licenses for stores to operate as well as the tax on alcohol. The citizens would benefit from not having to pay for the cost to operate the stores and all of the associated overhead costs. This is a win-win situation for our state. I respectfully urge you to look into this matter as a means of helping to reduce the state deficit. And, I would appreciate hearing your opinion on this proposal. Sincerely, Carol Winterbourne

Subject: Two Suggestions to Save the State tons of Money

Comment: Blow away the ABC boards. They serve no useful purpose. Let the market sell liquor/wine. You eliminate millions leases and salaries. Their contention about giving back taxes is just money paid by the taxpayers up front. Secondly, there are yellow DOT trucks that drive around the States interstates with one and sometimes two people that are just looking for people with a flat tire or out of gas. There are now cell phones. Let the private market handle these breakdowns. Any basic business approach outlines that it is much more cost effective to do this on an exception basis. That is, when a car breaks down someone is called out to fix/repair/tow the unit. Having 100 if not a couple thousand state vehicles driving around looking for cars that are broken down is just dumb. You save tons of capital on getting these assets of the books, tons of running costs (including fuel), and hundreds if not thousands of headcount reductions.

Comment: Dear Governor: As your constituent, I am writing this letter to urge you and your appropriate state agencies to act swiftly to implement the state requirements under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. Although the Adam Walsh Act provided that states have three years to comply with the requirements, delay in implementing these changes will jeopardize the safety of children and the community. Law enforcement needs the resources to protect children and communities from the scourge of convicted sex offenders: I urge you to fully implement all the state mandates within the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. I am particularly concerned about the following: 1. To implement an effective and comprehensive mechanism to verify the residence of the most high risk sex offenders at least once every three months. 2. To collect DNA samples from sex offenders who have not already provided them to local law enforcement. 3. To complete fingerprint-based background checks on all foster and adoptive placements to ensure that foster children are placed in safe homes. Citizens need access to accurate and timely information regarding convicted sex offenders living in their community. The 50 states and the federal government are responsible for building and maintaining an effective national sex offender database. A national sex offender database is a critical safeguard to protect Americaâs children and with each passing day that the provisions of this law are not implemented, the danger to children is heightened. The states are at the forefront to provide reliable information about the identity and whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. That information needs to be accessible, accurate and verifiable, or our communities are at grave risk. I strongly urge you to act now to implement the state-directed mandates passed in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act so that our children are kept safe from these dangerous predators and law enforcement has the necessary investigative resources.

Subject: Letter to Governor Beverly Perdue

Comment: To The Governor of North Carolina, Dear Governor Beverly Perdue, My name is Wesley Rabideau and I live in a small town named Sneads Ferry, I am married to my wife Trish Rabideau, We have two children Tyler Rabideau age 10 and Austin Rabideau age 7, My mother Pamela Rabideau and my father Larry Rabideau. I know you are probably wondering why I am listing all these family members, Well I just wanted to start this letter off with telling you a little about my family. Myself, my wife, and my two boys live with my mother and father in Sneads Ferry, I lost my job last November because of my kneeâs, I need a knee replacement and I am waiting on disability, I was a firefighter for 15 years, we all love to be with each other anyway, so its nice to live with my family. The reason I am writing you this letter is to see if there is a way you could help or get a bill passed for people in positions that we were in. On March 1st 2009 My Grandmother went on Kidney Dialysis at the age of 75, her name is Joyce Mueller. Myself, my wife and children, and my mother and father moved out of our house on Ennett Lane in Sneads Ferry NC, and moved in to my Grandmothers home to love and take care of her, We put renters in our home to help a little with the mortgage on our home. In April 2009 My Grandmother started going downhill with her health, my mother took a emergency leave from Food Lion for a unknown amount of time, because of my grandmothers health, My wife left her job to help with my grandmother also, I helped as much as I could with bad kneeâs, but as far as lifting I could not do. My father is retired US ARMY and works as a mechanic now. My mother went to the unemployement office to see if they could help her, because of her being out of work for over a half of year, and they told her that there was nothing that they could do to help her, and that they didnât know of anyone that could help. That is the reason I wanted to write you and see if there was a way you could help with passing a bill or law that would help familyâs financially like us that drop everything to take care of one of our loved ones in there finale days or months of life. I personally donât know how passing a bill or law like this would work, thatâs another reason I was writing you for help. The law or bill would not help us because my grandmother Joyce Mueller, A loving and caring mother, grandmother, and great grandmother, passed away with her family by her side the whole time on November 22, 2009 to be with her Lord and her loving husband Ronald E. Mueller. But if the Bill or Law was to be able to be passed, it would sure help other familys that are or going to be in the same position we were in, taking care of there loved ones on there finale days of life. I really and truly Thank You from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time out and reading this letter. If you would like to contact me or my family, We would be more than happy to talk to you. My Email is austin_2626@yahoo.com, and my cell number is 910-546-2652. Thank you again The Rabideau Family

Subject: Legalization of marijuana

Comment: Dear Bev Perdue: For many years, marijuana has been viewed in American society as a âbadâ drug because of its illegality. Many American citizens find this drug to be morally wrong. The idea of the legalization of this drug has caused a great number of heated debates in America. Many opponents of the legalization of marijuana state that this drug is âbadâ for you, will increase health hazards, and is a âgatewayâ drug. These concerns are very logical and reasonable, but are not accurate. Marijuana is indeed very beneficial to your health, can help treat medical diseases, and has been proven not to be a âgatewayâ drug. The legalization of marijuana will have many benefits not only for the state of North Carolina, but for the entire country. A myth that appears numerously when concerned with marijuana is the fact that it is more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. It is essential for Americans to understand that marijuana has been scientifically proven to be less harmful than alcohol or tobacco if used in moderation. Moderate smoking of marijuana appears to pose minimal damage to the lungs. In fact, there have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana. Also, none of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana, even from long term high-dose use. Heavy marijuana smokers exhibit no obstruction to the lungâs small airway. That indicates that people will not develop emphysema from smoking marijuana. Note that lung cancer, emphysema, and all of the other conditions listed above can be caused by cigarette smoking. Aside from the conditions it does not cause, marijuana also has numerous medical benefits. Marijuana greatly helps medical conditions. Research has found that marijuana actually works to slow down tumor growth in the lungs, breasts, and brain considerably. It has helps cancer patients deal with the nausea, fatigue, and other numerous symptoms that come with chemotherapy treatment. Marijuana is a muscle relaxant, and has âantispasmodicâ qualities. These qualities have been proven to be a very effect treatment for seizures. The Scripps Institute, in 2006, proved that the THC found in marijuana works to prevent Alzheimerâs by blocking the deposits in the brain that cause the disease. Despite these benefits, many experts argue that marijuana is a âgatewayâ drug, that is, cause people to use harder drugs. This is another important concept that Americans must understand, and another myth that must be abolished. Marijuana has not been scientifically proven to be a âgatewayâ drug. This drug has been scientifically proven to not cause people to use harder drugs, such as heroin. In fact, studies have shown that most marijuana users never use any other illegal drug. The âgatewayâ theory presents as a casual explanation, but is indeed a statistic that changes over time as different drugs increase or decrease in prevalence. Marijuana, for these reasons and many more, should be legalized. Our government must inform its citizens of the facts, benefits, and costs of marijuana. Many will find that the benefits outweigh the costs of the decision to legalize this drug. As a result, North Carolinaâs government must work to reform the marijuana prohibition laws. Citizens in return, need to know the important information and rally for the reform. California has already taken that step for reform, and as a result, this option for the legalization of marijuana will be on their 2010 ballot. This North Carolina government must take the same step. The road for reform of the marijuana prohibition laws needs to keep traveling until this country reaches the goal of legalizing marijuana. Sincerely, Kayla Carmenia, David W. Butler High School

Comment: Good day to you Governor Perdue, my wife and I are homeowners and members of the middle class. We love to remodel and upgrade own home. We currently have a list of things we want to do in our home. We currently utilize the services of handymen but we would love to give our business to contractors who work and are governed by either local or state agencies. This will eliminate the fraud and poor service that exists with home repair private companies and/or individuals. Your Administration can use stimulus money and create new jobs by training and certifying home repair contractors in all fields at local community colleges. You can also start this training at the high school level. This will bring revenue to North Carolina as the agencies can compete by bidding to get the business of North Carolina citizens and businesses.

Subject: Drug testing

Comment: I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my words . I would like to ask why is it that people on any kind of government assistance are not required to at least do random drug testing ? I mean almost every business requires at least random drug testing if not testing on a regular basis . I think that this could easily pay for itself by reducing fraud and abuse . It would at least create some jobs by adding inspectors . That would be 100 if we just added one inspector per county in North Carolina . Plus the lab technicians doing the testing . Also this would give these people a reason to get off drugs and find a job and it should cut down the sale of illegal drugs as they would not have the government money to pay for it . Please give this some thought and if you agree do something about it . Your Loyal supporter Robert F Williamson Jr

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue Did you know that the State and state agencies for over a decade has purchased the majority of its office furniture and other products from out of state sources even while in state products were available? In view of the depressed furniture industry and lost jobs -how could this happen?? I suggest that past "out of state" purchases vs "in state" availibility be studied and serious consideration be given to setting a governor policy that requires in-state preference be given on purchases.Many States already have such policies which is very wise in a negative tax revenue economy. Buying instate is a win-win for the state as the wage and earnings tax recovery from state business must be considered as part of the product saving when purchased in state. Thank You for consideration Sincerely; Randy Hollingsworth

Comment: Governor, I am a resident of Mecklenburg County since 1967 and NC since 1964. I strongly urge you to privatize the NC ABC system as it is in most other states. The recent Mecklenburg ABC incident involving the vendor dinner is just the latest good reason why. Granted, it's all about polititcs, but how about doing the right thing for NC? Thank you.

Comment: We need jobs and we have enviromental concerns so why don't put the two together and use recycling to create jobs that puts people to work and helps the enviroment thats a win/win. There is a program called Food to Flowers in San Fransico CA (http://www.sfenvironmentkids.org/) where schools collect all there reycleable waste and sends it to a composting facility using the Ag-Bag Composting Technology (http://www.jepsonprairieorganics.com/index.php)I propose creating this type of program for NC it would include schools, resturants and the general public. This would create jobs for collection, sorting, processing and the sale of organic material could replace chemical fertilizers with organic ones. Its probably best if the goverment sponsored new business through DPPEA to help with start up costs and assistance. Other opportunies along these lines are other pulp based product recycling a Canton NC company Evergreen has a process to recycle orange juice and milk type containers. Not to mention all the other wood waste from housing what if all of this could be collected and turned into mulch or pulp and resold and reused to create new items. What I am suggesting is that any and all forms of recycling could create a number of jobs for NC and set an example for other states. I would be more then happy to assist or participate in the creation of this type of opportunities. Sincerly Roger Lytle

Comment: H ow come when money is sent to local dss agencies to be used to help low income families pay bills such as rent,power,water,etc.But when they get the funds and you call them knowingly knowing they have them its always oh im so sorry but we just dont have any funds today.There is a lot of things going on that dont need to be going on.why should money intended for low income families(especially in these turmoil times)be used on a director a vacation,car,etc.I think an investigation especially of all documentation on fund spending should be done ,especially in Bolivia,where not to long ago employees were fired and family members arrested for embezzling county funds,by having them sent to family members,where is the justice in that.The county arrested them yes,but didnt retrieve the funds back.
