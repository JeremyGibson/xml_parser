Subject: Advisory Panel on Offshore Energy

Comment: As a member of the coastal wind working group I was sent a copy of the slides presented at the Buxton offshore wind meeting the other week. I was a little disappointed that the consultants in charge of the offshore platforms section of the report omitted a long-proven method of supporting equipment in an offshore environment. It is also the least expensive. I contacted Harvey Seim who presented the slides at the Buxton meeting so he could comment for the panel. See below. Re: Offshore Platforms Tuesday, September 29, 2009 1:39 AM From: "Harvey Seim" To: "Robert Getchell" "You are correct, the Dutch firm who suggested appropriate foundation designs did not consider this one. Thanks for pointing it out." Harvey Titan 200 Offshore Wind Platform This platform can be set up in depths of up to 200 feet, without the use of pilings or jack-up barges. The oil industry has been using the Titan 200 Platform in offshore oil fields for decades. Recently one of the original designers, Doug Hines of Offshore Wind Platforms of Texas, modified the design for wind turbine applications. A major advantage is all assembly takes place in port. When the three deck platform is towed out of port, with a turbine already erected on the top deck, it is a registered vessel. Once in place the three legs are lowered to the bottom, ballast tanks are filled, the footings settle 8-12 feet into the bottom, and are then covered with concrete matting for scour protection. Once leveled the platform is jacked up 60 feet above the ocean surface. J-tubes in the legs carry cable from the seabed to the switching disconnects and other equipment inside the platform. The Titan platforms survived the category 5 winds of Katrina a few years ago, with no damage. MMS has certified the design for offshore use in US waters. Using a platform is cheaper than a piling, and environmental impacts from construction, assembly and decommissioning are virtually eliminated. For an additional cost, decks can be retrofitted to carry additional equipment, house crew and there is also a desalinization system that is made for the Titan 200 platform. We looked at Cape Winds proposal, talked to a lot of the designers and environmental consultants who worked on the project, even met with Doug Hines in DC where he had been called to speak before a congressional panel about these wind platforms. Any offshore project we pursue will use the Titan 200 Wind Platform. We are focusing on acquisition of Frying Pan Shoals tower to get an offshore site in a prime wind location. If USACE will allow us to turn the old tower into an artificial reef we'll replace the old tower with a new Titan 200 on the same lease site. I encourage you to google up Offshore Wind Platforms of Texas. I'm sure Doug can answer any questions you or anyone else may have. There is also some cost comparison information on the site that is useful. Sincerely, Bob Getchell Noreaster Energy Partners

Subject: The Equipment Industry is in a Depression: Act Now!

Comment: Harold Marvin 1010 Atando Ave Charlotte, NC 28206-2251 October 23, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to urge you to work with your colleagues to enact legislation that will assist the construction equipment industry recover from the terrible economic situation the industry is currently facing. While other sectors of the U.S. economy appear to be recovering from the recession, the construction equipment industry remains mired in a deep depression. On September 29, the Associated Equipment Distributors (AED) and the Associated Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) released the results of an equipment industry economic condition. Among the key findings: � The construction equipment industry - which includes manufacturing, distribution and maintenance companies - has shed a staggering 37 percent of its workforce since the equipment market peaked in 2006. By comparison, auto manufacturing and dealership jobs are down by 16 percent, while job losses in the finance and insurance industry amount to 6 percent of their workforce. � Spending on construction equipment has fallen by more than 50 percent compared to its peak in 2006. � The economic output of this industry has contracted by nearly 40 percent and resulted, directly and indirectly, in the loss of approximately 550,000 jobs. In other words, eight percent of all jobs lost since the start the recession have been associated with the equipment industry downturn. � Over the course of the recession, losses to industry sales and employment have decimated the taxes paid on employee income, corporate profits and sales of machinery; the magnitude of the decline indicates that taxes revenues associated with our industry have fallen by $12.8 billion. Without significant congressional action, the construction industry economic crisis will continue for the foreseeable future and prevent recovery in the broader economy. In order to assist the construction equipment industry recover from the depression it is in, I urge Congress to quickly pursue the following legislative initiatives to create new construction industry jobs and revitalize the construction equipment industry. � Invest in critical infrastructure by swiftly passing multi-year reauthorization bills that increase investment in the nation's highways, public transportation, bridges, sewers, drinking water systems, and airports. To pay for investment in the highway program, Congress should support a user fee increase, the fairest and most fiscally responsible way to pay for additional revenue. Many leading business groups support a user fee increase, including AED, AEM, AAA, the American Trucking Associations, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. � Ensure that credit is available to equipment distributors, manufacturers, purchasers, and to developers. The construction industry is facing an unprecedented credit crisis. Congress and the executive branch must work together to put programs in place to ensure that dealers and manufacturers have access to capital to run their companies, that customers can get credit to buy equipment, and that developers can access the money they need to undertake new construction projects. � Extend and expand the home purchase tax credit. � Extend the stimulus bill's capital investment incentives and create new tax credits to encourage "clean diesel" equipment purchases. � Extend and expand net operating loss (NOL) carry back rules. Congress should allow 2009 losses to be carried back for five years and significantly raise the eligibility cap for companies to take advantage of NOL carry-back benefits. I urge you to strongly consider the aforementioned proposals. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, H.W. Marvin III 7043330786
