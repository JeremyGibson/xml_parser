Subject: State Pay Reduction

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a state employee and am very disturbed about your decision to reduce the pay of state employees to cover the budget's shortfall. I understand that economically we are in hard times, but my question for you is, "why is the shortfall the responsibility of only state employees--shouldn't that burden fall on ALL of the citizens of North Carolina"?

Subject: Teachers lay offs

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I understand that when money is short, cuts have to be made. I see where you have to cut real deep on teachers salaries however, I do have a real important question to ask about that..We saw on TV (channel 13 ABC) the in the past 3 years, over a billion dollars was brought in thru the NC Lottery for education. What happened to all that money? Did someone abscond with it or just what happen to a billion dollars? I have not seen many Million dollar winners. I really hope to hear from you about this. Thank You, Sincerely, Jerome Darrow Cary, NC

Subject: Education budget cuts

Comment: As a teacher in a public school, parent of a charter school student, Board member of a charter school, and a registered democrat, I feel compelled to contact your office about the recent budget cuts to all schools. Just want to say that this is the worst possible place to take away funds. If there is one place that should remein untouched by budget cuts it is the education and future of our children. NC already ranks pretty low when it comes to the quality of primary education in comparison to other states. Please reconsider this plan. Many are asking "What happened to the lottery money?" Seems like the money the state is raking in from the lottery should keep this from happening to our schools. So far, I am less than impressed with your service to North Carolina. However, as I said, I am a life long democrat and will continue to support you but you're not making it easy!!! Sincerely, Yours in Service, Robin Allred Asheville City Schools

No one has returned my calls or sent me any information regarding to why my case is not being wrapped up. Please I know you are extremely busy, but there is a principle involved in my case and once resolved other people with disablities (especially young) might be able to attend the college and perhaps gain employment there when they meet the requirements and and the education.

Subject: Stolen funds / breach of contract

Comment: Governor Perdue How can you STEAL money from our childrens education by taking money from the EDUCATION LOTTERY? The citizens voted in the lottery for the proceeds to be used for education, NOT for your personal waste fund. To use the funds for any other purpose is ILLEGAL without the voters approval. How much have you cut your own salary and the wages of your personal staff? Robbing the school teachers is wrong! Quit traveling around on vacations, Ashville, etc, at tax payers expense. Start performing your job as a responsible leader of this state, not as a typical tax and spend useless politician! We need smart people to work our way through these trouble times, try to find some or the voters will during the next elections!

He also has two older white Cadillacâ€™s and a Jeep Cherokee on the street with no license plate on it. All in violation of state law. I want someone to please uphold the law and have those vehicles towed off, ticketed, or moved on his property. If you need me to file a formal complaint to get this done, I will be happy to do so.

Subject: Industrial animal farms

Comment: May 1, 2009 Honorable Governor Perdue, The U.S. Agriculture industry has been headed in the wrong direction since the 1970â€™s with the development of factory poultry farms, followed in the 1990â€™s by the factory hog farms in North Carolina by Smithfield Foods from Virginia. Building factory hog farms quickly spread to other states where state legislatures would permit them. Now Smithfield Foods is in Mexico where the swine flu is raging. The hormones and antibiotics given to these animals are passed on to those who eat this meat. Not only that, since the animals are not plant or grass fed, there is no nutrition to be found for those who consume it. Imagine one hog house with 10,000 hogs unable to be outside, being given antibiotics in their specially concocted food to minimize disease from their unsanitary living conditions. Every day farmers must gather the dead chickens, turkeys or hogs, put them on a truck, and then transport them on our roads somewhere for disposal. You havenâ€™t lived if youâ€™ve never passed one of these dead hog trucks on the road (overfilled to capacity) and then your vehicle is drenched with the fluids that slop out from the heavy load. North Carolina has 4,000 farms with open-air waste lagoons, which store waste from roughly 9.6 million hogs. People who live nearby cannot get a breath of fresh air. Many suffer from asthma or other respiratory health problems. Mike Easley was still the stateâ€™s Attorney General when Smithfield, whose industrial farms at the time, produced two-thirds of the stateâ€™s hogs, agreed to phase out waste lagoons within 5 years and to convert to cleaner disposal systems. Itâ€™s now been 8 years and hog lagoons are still with us. These farms should be shut down immediately until this problem is corrected. Our elected officials, who have a responsibility to protect and defend the rights of the citizenry that elected them, have failed in their duties. A clean and healthy environment is among those rights. Yet our state and federal governments have permitted that the hogs in North Carolina may be given more antibiotics than prescribed for humans in the U.S per year and it goes into our food and water supply. We need to replace factory farms with organic, hormone and antibiotic-free, grass fed animals living on community farms that served us well so many years. Our food supply should be fresh and local rather than global. How soon can we expect an end to devastating air and water pollution caused by animal waste? Lorraine Hoge

Subject: Unable to get assistance from Dept. of Revenue

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I lived in NC from 2002 - 2005. I moved back to VA for family reasons and got a letters from the Dept. of Revenue stating I owed taxes. Do to my negligence I did not get them the information in time and there was a judgment entered against me. I provided them with the information needed and the balance went to zero and the lien was released. I spoke to Mr. Hale asking if they could remove the lien from my credit records and he said there was nothing he could do. I then sent an email to Mr. Voss to no avail. If I owed the money I would never ask that this be done but as you can imagine, especially with the change in the world of credit, this has dropped my score by no less than 100 points. I have had some difficulties in co-signing for my son's college loans. It is my hope that this can be removed and my good credit that I worked so hard to achieve will be back in good standing. I will be happy to send the documents from the department if you need them. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Sincerely, Brett Thompson

Subject: Columbus County NC Child protective services

Comment: Hello, My name is Kim Slagle. I live in Toledo, OH and currently have four Grandchildren living in Columbus County NC. I want to express my complete disatisfaction with the Columbus County Child Protection Services. My daughter has been living in the county since October 2008. She has had a very bad track record as far as caring for her children. Her husband is in the US Army and is currently stationed at Ft. Campbell KY. At the moment our daughter is living with a 19 year old whom she met on the internet. Our daughter has had the child protection agency in her life since she arrived in the county. I have spoken to many of the workers at the agency and have been told that she refuses to follow the mandated procedures that the agency set forth. I was told on Thursday, April 30, 2009 that the caseworker had paid a visit to her home and was told to F off. The worker was told that she was not allowed in and that she did not have to do anything. The worker proceded to call me and inform me of what occured. She then told me that since our daughter could not and would not follow what they mandated that she was planning to go back to the office and talk with her supervisor to see about getting a court order to take the children. Since I live in Ohio it is a 13 hour drive to her place of residence. The worker ask me how soon I could get down there and of course I told her I could leave at any time. That evening it occured to me that our daughter may flee with the children since she has done this twice in the past year. She was living in Ohio in May of 2008 and when the local children services got involved she fled to NC. She took up residence in Tennesee when her husband returned from overseas (they were seperated) and once again fled when children services was called. Now she is in Columbus county NC. My issue is this. I have tried many times to get someone to listen to me regarding our daughters state of mind. I am not a doctor, but I am a mother and grandmother. My daughter has had a huge problem which I cannot fix. I believe that she has many mental issues and is incapable of caring for her four children until she gets help. I do not want to take her children from her. I however refuse to let them live the lifestyle that she chooses. That includes not getting up with them in the mornings. Not cleaning her home. Not paying any bills until it is shut off or disconnected. The children have lived without supervision, water, heat, and food. I don't know all the guodelines that Columbus county uses to determine neglect. I was very distraught on Friday May 1, 2009 when I attempted to contact the agency just to be told that someone would call back. The superviser finnaly did after 3 hours and I was told that she would have to consult with the case worker to find out what had occured the day before. When I called her back I was told that they would not be taking any action at that time. Well I was very upset with the situation and called to director of the agency. She was not very helpful and was upset when I informed her of the things that I had heard regarding the agency. What I had heard from more then one source was the agency was run poorly and most people had no faith in the system. The last thing that she told me was our daughter had created a big problem and she would not say anymore. Needless to say I will spend the entire weekend wondering what she ment by that. All that I really want is for our daughter to get the help that she need so that our grandchildren can live produtive live and feel loved and happy. She has disruped their lives many times and it really needs to stop. One of the children is autistic and she does nothing to help him. She is a known liar and can talk a good talk. I don't know what the exact problem is that she spends her money on but it sure is not her household needs. Please check into this as soon as you can a please regulate this agency so that the children of columbus county NC can get the help they need. Thank You Kim Slagle 419-843-3542

I realize the Helms cased occurred on Gov. Easley's watch, but the cover-up, or at the least the appearance of one, is happening on your watch. I know a lot about the case from previous discussions with staff at DRNC, but will keep info confidential. But you really need to look into this situation. Helms was mistreated regardless of whether he was beaten into submission by guards leaving him a quad. Please make me proud of my vote for you last November. I have less faith than ever in the Dems in NC with what I know now.

Subject: I-485 from South Blvd to Providence Rd

Comment: I understand that there is a concern over the completion of I-485 in the norheast corridor. However there is a greater problem with I-485 that exists from South Blvd to Providence Rd. This is by far the heaviest travelled part of I-485 yet with the fewest lanes. During rush hour, the traffic backs up for miles in this stretch that can easily be fixed by adding a third lane between these two landmarks. There also is a flyover that is to be included in this project that will take the traffic from Johnston road north unto the inner loop of I 485. Right now you have to turn left off from Johnston Rd unto the innerloop of I-485. Johnston Rd carries a large volume of traffic from South Carolina in North Carolina and is continously busy. Right now the plans for widening only include from South Blvd to Johnston Rd. But that is clearing not enough. This problem has existed for over 12 years now and has gotten nothing but worse and has been ignored by NCDOT. Currently widenting is not to occur until 2015. We cannot wait that long. If we do, this will become nothing more than a parking lot. Can we at least look on moving that date up to start in 2011. Thank you for listening.

Subject: non violent offender release program

Comment: Dear Mrs Perdue, I am a wife of a prisioner that is incarcerated in one of your prisioners who has a non violent history, but on the other hand in the past has had a drug problem. I really feel that he would better benefit from a drug rehab program with his familys support in stead of being in prison. I am not sure how the non violent release program would work even if it was passed, but I am speaking for his family and many others, I really feel that he would be better off home with his support group to keep him safe and save the state tax payers a lot of money. I do not want you to think that I am writing this in selfish ways, but in my case he has done wrong and I know and pray deeply in my heart that he has learned from his mistakes and now all that he really wants is to be home with his children, his wife and his parents. I guess that I am asking for you to take some of these things into consideration, and also to keep me updated with any details that you can. I really want and need my husband back. Again thank you for taking the time to allow me to write to you. Sincerely Heather Yeager wife of Duane Yeager

Comment: I am a Specialist in the National Guard over with the 505th Gastonia, NC unit. I have not been paid for my duites in three months. I am in debt and the state still has not paid me my guard pay. My problem (other than not getting my earned money is) I live in Newport and need to travel 6 hours to get to Gastonia. I do this every month & miss time out on work. I do not have the funds to get me there but am told I need to. The contract says I need to go but also states I need to get paid for my time for my service. I sincerly need your help because many of us here with the National Guard have not recieved our pay & I believe from where I stand we are all tired of being away from our families and not being paid for our work. Please help us. Thank you. Sincerly, SPC. Brian D. Stewart

Comment: I just heard you are asking for $41MM in budget cuts from the Schools in our State. What is world are you doing with the $1Billion made in the NC Lottery? Where is that money going and why can't you take some of it to use for Schools? I don't understand how there could be that much money taken in and we don't even know where it's going. You need to let the people of NC know what you're spending that money on.

Subject: Foreclosure

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: RE: Loan #1577384315 My home is being scheduled to foreclose on May 8th, 2009 by Brock & Scott PLLC of Wilmington NC. My loan has been determined as fraudulent from the origination by a representative of Chase Home Finance Fraud Department who was at the Hope for Homeowners workshop I attended in Charlotte on April 25th, 2009 for distressed homeowners. According to law, there is no holder in due course by definition in connection with my loan if the loan is fraudulent. The Obama Housing Plan reveals that my loan was sold to Fannie Mae, yet Chase Home Finance LLC and Brock & Scott are illegally foreclosing my home. There are several reasons why this foreclosure should be stopped: 1. $127,319 of my down payment is misstated on the loan, 2. The underlying contract is incomplete and undated, 3. Several loan documents do not bear my signature; 4. I did not get a 3-day Rescission Notice; 5. The amount and terms of the loan were changed (unbeknownst to me) at the closing; 6. I did not receive all the loan disclosures at the closing, including a title policy. All of the above should void the agreement. Please contact me immediately at the telephone number provided to stop this unjustified foreclosure. In addition, I am a supporter of the Democratic Party and have written the President about this unfortunate situation that is currently dire. I believe that I have not been treated fairly in getting help with my case is because of my gender and race. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Peggy I. Johnson

Subject: NC employment security commision debit card program

Comment: My name is Hugh D Muse Jr. SS# 238-08-0972. I would like to file a formal complaint about NC employment security commision issueing debit cards. I have yet to see my money / debit card even though I did everything right as far as filling out a direct deposit slip to avoid this crap all together and yet I find myself stuck right in the middle of it. My claim was for the week ending April 11, 2009. I have contacted the local ESC office they informed me that I would receive a debit card even though I did not ask for one. They give me the number to the debit card company and they informed me that I would recieve my debit card on May 1, 2009. May 1, 2009 has come and gone I still do not have my money. How am I suppose to pay my bills on time ???????? I think the debit card is a croc of crap and this company is making a killing in profit off from poor un educated people for the following reasons. ESC pays this company peoples benifits money, this company holds the funds for 10 days ( it takes 10 days to recieve the debit card) If we multiply the dollar amount X the number of claims (1 million people) wow that has to be a lot of money and the company earns money known as interest to educated people. The poor and uneducated people get screwed again. This is not to even mention the fact of the outragous fees they charge for the use of the debit card. Seeing how unemployment is at its highest peak since the great depression I wonder to myself how the state of NC would feel about a nice little class action lawsuit against them on this issue? I am sure there are many others out there in my same situation. I am not interested in a debit card please make sure my funds are sent to me as direct deposit as originally requested by me on March 27, 2009 Where is my money???????????????? We are now starting on week 5 that I am waiting on my money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hugh D muse Jr.

Subject: Teacher Pay

Comment: I understand that with the current financial situation it is tough for everyone to try to balance their budgets. However, I do not understand why teacher's paychecks have to be touched since the NC Lottery was suppose to be put in place to help with education finances. Teacher's already give a lot of themselves including buying things for their classrooms without getting reimbursed for it. Small treats to give the kids for prizes for doing a good job, pencils for the kids who don't have one, decoration for the class, etc. Teachers can't really afford to pour their own money into their classrooms, but they do because they care for the kids they teach. If their pay gets cut, morale will go down, and classroom performance will decrease. Why can't the lottery funds supplement the money that is suppose to come out of the teacher's next paycheck??? I just saw a commercial that says the NC Lottery has raised $1 billion. Where is it at??? Thanks, From a concerned citizen Brian Murray

Subject: salary impact on "locally" funded positions-

Comment: I sent this to Rowan-Salisbury Schools finance director. If the state does not giveth to my salary, how can it legally taketh away? It can't be both ways now can it? Sent on Friday 5/1/09: Hi Tara, I know this has been a very busy year for you. This is a true technicality but I felt it worth asking. If positions such as mine, are not state funded but purely locally funded, then will I still be affected by the salary decrease for the remainder of the fiscal year? For years, I have been told that my salary category could not be locally honored at the state recommended level of 63 because it was not "state funded", yet I get to suffer the decrease due to state funding? This truly does not seem fair. As always, any feedback that you can give will be greatly appreciated.--Have a great Spring weekend.-D Donna L.

I just tried to find a contact number for the Department of Revenue via their website, and only found the toll free number for the automated service. When I called the NC information line, I received the same useless automated phone number and was told that this was the only number listed for the DOR. I must have a more definitive answer as to the status of our tax return, as it has been two months since postmark. I must talk to a someone at the DOR concerning this injustice, but need contact information for the DOR. I will be expecting the DOR contact information from your office in a timely manner.

I am writing to find out where I can obtain more information about these courses. 2. Does the State of North Carolina provide grants to those with no income at all to assist them in going to school to obtain new training so they are not a burden to the community at large? If not, where do low-income people obtain information on obtaining funds to further their education? Sincerely appreciate any direction or assistance you can provide. Elliott J. Prescod

Comment: I voted for you and though you would be a good governor, but letting the employment security commission raise the percent from 1.2 to 3.0 is horrible. I own X-Geeks Inc. and small computer repair shop that is struggling in the current economy and you let them raise this to 3.0%. This is a huge raise that is almost triple the norm. I would like to see you do something about this. I know there are a lot of people out of work right now but i kept all my employees employed so i should not have to pay a higher percent when other companies have laid people off. You being from the real world i feel would understand this and could help. A response to this would be appreciated.

Subject: unemployment

Comment: Dear Govornor Perdue, I have been out of work since March 8, 2009 and my old boss continues to deny me my unemployment benefits. I had to turn the tags in on my car because of an accidental lapse in insurance. I was working as a delivery driver for C and D pizza in Surf City, NC. When I turned my tags in I told my bosses and informed them that I had another I could use until my car was straightened and I even offered to sign a waiver stating that if I were to get into an accident on the job I would make sure that my insurance company would cover it. They refused and the general manager said that I could work inside for the thirty days my car would not have tags. However I only worked inside for 2 days the third day I was called and told we were overstaffed and I didn't need to come in. The next day as I was getting dressed for work the general manager called me and told me that they did not have enough hours available for me to work inside and that I could come back when my car was fixed. It has been almost 9 weeks now since I have worked a single hour and my old boss is still refusing me my unemployment saying that I am still employed. Is there anyway you can help me with this situation? If you need anymore information please let me know.

Subject: Deadly, horrible intersection needs to be corrected!!

Comment: Please forward this to the appropriate people: Going south on S. Miami Blvd, taking a left on to Angier Avenue, just south of highway 70 is an impossible turn. The intersection traffic light is more than several hundred feet from the turn, and on a green light (without a turn signal) turning left is potentially deadly! This, and a hill on highway 70, on the other side of Angier Avenue when it t-bones highway 70 is ridiculous, it prevents you from seeing cars more than 10 feet away, and these cars are going upwards of 55 MPH. Crossing this 8-10 foot lane is like playing Russian Roulette! The civil engineering team and city planners that designed these two intersections should be considered criminals because I would highly bet these poor designs are killing people every year. They should be ashamed of themselves for putting us at such risk! Please look into this for our public safety's sake! Thank you, Stewart Alexander

Subject: Unfair treatment to Military Member

Comment: Dearest Senator Mrs. Bev Perdue, My name is Justine Erhardt. I am writing you in regards to my fiancee Private First Class Franklin J. Zerangue, who currently serving in the United States Marine Corps. The reason I am writing is that myself and Franklin feel he is being treated unfair by his command, 8Th Communications Battalion (Camp Lejeune, North Carolina) and feel that there is no where else to turn. On December 13, 2008, Franklin was driving from Camp Lejeune to the Raleigh/Durham Airport in Raleigh, NC and was falsely accused of speeding and was ticketed. He went to the court date and tried to fight the charge but the police officer didn't show up so the court date was pushed back to a later date. When Franklin informed his chain of command, they immediately questioned his integrity and decided that he was at fault for the speeding ticket. His command is now trying to Non-Judicially Punish him for a speeding ticket that he hasn't been found guilty for. Not only did Franklin hire a lawyer for this case against the ticket, he has also enrolled himself into a Defensive Driving Course offered by a local community college. Franklin and myself recently had a child and were planning on going on a two week vacation to Louisiana to visit his mother and introduce the baby to the family. Now that his command decided that they want to punish Franklin for something that he didn't do, they wont let him take the leave days he has earned, saying that he is pending a NJP (Non-Judicial Punishment). I don't understand how someone can be punished for something that they not only didn't do, but have not been found guilty of doing in court. Shouldn't his command wait until his next court date on the 26Th of May to see whether or not he is guilty before they take away his leave and NJP him? There seems to be no one with any sense about the whole situation in his chain of command... Will you please be that person? We would really appreciate it if you could speak up for Franklin. Thank You, Justine S. Erhardt justine.erhardt@gmail.com 910-347-4860

Comment: My husband and I are both National Board certified teachers and we are hearing that this entire pay scale is being proposed for elimination in the 2009-2010 budget. In our estimation, this would cut our household income by appx. 24%. Could you provide feedback on the status of this as we are hearing many things in our schools? Thank you.

Subject: Wearing gloves to prepare food in restaraunts

Comment: I am very confused with the rules and regulations of the restaraunts pertaining to employees not wearing gloves to prepare our food. With all of the diseases that are being transfered from person to person, it looks like the government would impose a bill that would require every person who touches our food to wear gloves. I have been in several different fast food restaraunts and watched the person making my food touch the food with there bare hands. Just today I was in a Burger King in New Hanover County, NC and watched them put my burger together and it was made wrong so I took it back and the cook never washed his hands but opened up my sandwich and with bare hands picked up my burger and put cheese on the bun, then he wrapped it in the same paper and gave it to the counter person. I asked the girl if they were required to wear gloves and she replied "No we are not required to wear gloves". The more I thought about what I saw it just made me sick. I there for about an hour with my daughter and I watched them and not the first person washed there hands, NOT EVEN THE MANAGER!!!!! This is why I feel that everyone must wear gloves because this is why there are so many people getting sick!!!!! Is there anyone else I can contact about this issue????? Thanks for listening Patricia Foley

Subject: My daughter

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Back on January 27th, 2003 I became very ill and had to go to the hospital for treatment and left my only child for one of my siblings to take care of. I did not know that I was going to be admitted to the hospital for several days; nor did I know that my two siblings would not take care of my daughter. However, the state also messed up by holding on to my daughter and not releasing her back to me once I was released from the hospital. The person that was in charge of the case was Nina Wright. Once I was released from the hospital I was told by Nina Wright that they had custody of my daughter and I will not be able to see her or get her back, unless the court restored my custody rights. Based on North Carolinaâ€™s custody laws there must be some burden of proof that a child is in danger, abused or is afraid to live with the biological parent; I can be wrong about the laws. My daughter was not abused, in danger or was I a threat to her. The state should have given her back to me immediately once I left the hospital. I was told that she was in emergency foster care. Nina Wright also did not allow any of my family members to get custody of my daughter; I have five sisters and three brothers who wanted to take my daughter plus my mother, they were each told that my daughter, Gabrielle, was not allowed to leave the state as well. Most of my siblings live outside of North Carolina. Nina Wright also held a meeting at my motherâ€™s apartment; she lives in Raleigh, without my attorney and my knowledge. She iterated to my siblings who were at the meeting that neither of them were allowed to get custody of my daughter. They came from Brooklyn, New York and Manassas, Virginia. My mother was immediately ruled out because based on Nina Wrightâ€™s laws my mother was not fit to have custody of my daughterâ€¦the reason was based on my mother leaving us in Jamaica for a period of time while she worked and made preparations for us to come to the United States. My mother never abandons us; she left us with my aunt who took great care of us. Once my mother was able to work and save up enough money she sponsored the older kids so that they can help her by working. In 1979 the last bunches of us were able to come to the states. According to Nina Wrightâ€™s law my mother left us to suffer therefore she was wicked and did not deserve to get my daughter. My mother had a place for Gabby because she lives in a two bedroom apartment in Raleigh and still does today. Nina Wright was very rude and disrespectful to my mother as well; she is ignorant about immigration laws and the push pull factor. My daughterâ€™s father did not want anything to do with her and gladly gave up his parental rights without a fuss. I was living in a shelter and was homeless at the time. The state of North Carolina took away all of my benefits including the most important thing of all my Medicaid that I needed to take care of my mental illness. You asked why my family did not take me in and helped me, the answer to that is they did not care about my welfare and that is the truth. I feel very a shame to tell you this but being homeless was the hardest life that I lived. Suffering from depression, without family and care is no joke. The shelters in Raleigh did not want me either. I hoped on a bus and ended up in Washington, DC where I again lived in a shelter for several months. All this time my daughter was in the custody of the state. Despite the fact that they did not want me living with them, not all of them, they all wanted my daughter. Sheâ€™s the only child I have and I cannot have anymore, I had to have a full hysterectomy when I was 37. I had my daughter at age 33. Nina Wright also allowed me to see my daughter only two times since 1/27/03. The date was her 10th birthday, October 30th and one more time two weeks later. Then the visitation stopped. I have not seen my daughter since that day, sheâ€™s now 15. I cry everyday and not a day go by when I donâ€™t miss her. I want her back. Iâ€™m now attending the University of Iowa, living in a two bedroom apartment and working. But Nina Wright gave my daughter up for adoption in less than a year after she entered the system. She never gave me a chance to get myself together, she took matters into her own hands and did not respect my attorneys or the court and made up lies about me without talking to me. I will admit I did miss court dates only because I had nowhere to live, was without a job and unable to provide for my daughter. However, to put her up for adoption in less than a year was just too soon; I have heard of cases where the court allowed the biological parent years to get themselves together and did allow them visitation rights or overnight stay, but I was denied all of the above. Now I do write to my daughter and have sent her clothes, laptop, IPod and lots of money to let her buy the things that she needs and the adoptive mother gives me permission to do so. In fact I write her just about every month. If I donâ€™t hear from my daughter I call the case worker and beg her to make a call to the adoptive mother to ask her if she can let my daughter write me. Iâ€™ve missed out on her Elementary school graduation, junior high school; sheâ€™s now in high school and her menstrual period. I was her only parent for nine years, no father around just me. She was born at seven months and yes I nursed her and took very good care of her. I can recall the only time that she was sick is when she had her tonsils remove that was age five. Can you please open up my case and assign someone to look into everything and do a full investigation and find out why my only child was rushed off to adoption so soon as well as why the state did not give me time to get myself together along with visitation rights? I currently live in Iowa City, Iowa and plan on returning to Raleigh next May 2010 for grad school. My goal is to become a juvenile delinquent case worker; due to everything that Iâ€™ve been through which is hell and back I strongly believe that I can make a difference in a childâ€™s life. I look forward to hearing from you and if Iâ€™ve made you confused I apologize because Iâ€™m basing everything on what the state told me. Plus my daughter wants to come back home to me. I am able to care for her and have been for the past several years but no one ever gave me a chance. Please help me? If you canâ€™t can you please pass this letter of dying request to the appropriate department. My daughter is half Jamaican and Puerto Rican and she living with African Americans who do not know anything about her cultures if I had a say into the matter it would be for her to be place with a Jamaican or Puerto Rican family. My daughter in one of her many letter to me stated that she misses her Jamaican culture a lot and begged me to send her a Jamaican t-shirt, which I did. I cried.

Subject: K-12 Funding

Comment: I oppose an increase in class size. It will negatively impact many of the gains made in our school with lower-performing children. Increasing class sizes and adding additional periods to a teachers' workload reduce the time that teachers have to provide academic intervention. More at risk children will fail. The last minute reversion from K-12 schools is tantamount to a breach of contract. I just attended a school governance meeting for my daughter's middle school and wanted to convey to you some challenges caused by the budget flux. For the past several weeks, our principle has been doing very little other than running schedules and staffing scenarios to accommodate possible changes in class size and other budget changes. These demands on her schedule negatively impact the teacher mentoring and other academic oversight that we expect principals to do. Time is running out. The teachers who still have jobs next year will be teaching new classes and must develop lesson plans. They need to know what classes they will teach very soon. Also, the counselors who are critical to the student & class scheduling process are done for the year around June 19th, which is coming very soon. The school districts need a class size answer. I understand that this is a challenging budget year. We only have one chance to educate our children and I ask you to minimize these impacts. Please keep me updated on the class size and school funding issues. Sincerely, Mark Peters Chapel Hill
