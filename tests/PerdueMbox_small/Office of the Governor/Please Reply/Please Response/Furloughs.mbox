Subject: Teacher Pay Cut

Comment: Ms. Perdue I am writing to find out the thought process behind deducting pay from our NC teachers in order to balance the budget. These providers of our childrens education, are already underpaid and overworked. With most living from paycheck to paycheck. What made you believe docking there pay was a good idea. And did you take such a pay cut? If not that seems to be hypocritical. -Concerned NC citizen
