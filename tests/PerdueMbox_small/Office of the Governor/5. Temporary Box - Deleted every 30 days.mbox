Subject: Stiffer Cild Abuse Laws

Comment: I wanted to know why my daughter: Karin Thomas-Dozier and her husband Demetrius Dozier only received a slap on the hand, after, almost every limb in my grandsons body was broken, when he was between 1week and 6 weeks old. I thought you stated when you were running for govern, that the child abuse laws were going to get stiffer, well now is the time. Guilford County Social Services is planning on putting my grandson back with his mother just because, she is following her case plan even though when she meet Mr. Dozier, he was in the process of being convicted of felony child abuse for his first son and received 14 months and only received 24 months for doing this to my grandson. Please do not let my grandson be a victim of placing him back with his mother and he ends up dead. PLEASE DO NOT LET MY GRANDSON GO BACK TO DIE

District's 5, 6, and 7 are all located in Burke, Caldwell, and McDowell Counties and are very proud to have over 5,000 state employees as members of SEANC. The District 5 meeting will start at 6:00 PM with a catered meal and our Business Session will start at 7:00 PM. We are requesting that Bev honor us with her presence as our 'Guest Speaker'.

Sean please use the following reply for all longevity items:


Thank you for your e-mail regarding longevity pay for state employees. I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



On March 17, 2008, the Governor presented her 2009-2011 proposed budget to the North Carolina General Assembly. For a detailed view of the spending plan, you may wish to visit: http://www.governor.state.nc.us/budget.aspx . While the Governorâ€™s budget includes a proposal to temporarily suspend longevity payments to eligible state employees, it is important to note that this proposal will not adversely impact retirement pay. Also, by temporarily suspending longevity payments, Governor Perdue is able to keep class size low and protect classroom teachers from potential lay offs. Additionally, Governor Perdueâ€™s budget proposal includes a step increase for teachers.



The final decision for the balanced budget will be in the hands of the legislators as they work through all of this in the next few months. I encourage you to speak with your local members of the NC General Assembly and follow the budget process as it develops by visiting www.ncleg.net <http://www.ncleg.net/> .



Thank you for all you do for the children of North Carolina.

All we have heard about class size is that class numbers will have to be higher....

We are still the ones being 'temporarily' docked $ that due to us....while we are the ones doing all the work. Dock the pay of those in central office that can more readily afford to do so. Plus getting rid of teachers will also point to larger class sizes. I will save this email for when I get my class list.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I would like to weigh in on your appointment for the District Attorney for the 7th district.  I support the best candidate for the job regardless of race.  I personally feel that Keith Werner is that candidate based on his record and experience but I hope you are looking for the best candiate as well.  I am a minority and I do not support the best white, black, hispanic or asian candidate for the job.  I support the best candidate period.  Although this is the appropriate thing to do, our system has been so hijacked by special interests (including those who only support certain races for an appointment like this), it now requires political courage to do the right thing.  I hope you have that courage.

Most Sincerely,

Subject: Congress to fast-track socialized healthcare this week!

from the Desk of:
Steve Elliott, President
Grassfire.org Alliance

          Back-room deal this week will put socialized healthcare on
          the fast-track. Please see below and alert your friends.
                            --Steve

Ashe,

We have just been alerted that House and Senate leaders are moving
very quickly to put socialized healthcare on a fast-track THIS WEEK
as part of the revised Obama budget.

Members of the House-Senate conference have struck a deal with
Harry Reid and the Obama team to require just a simple majority
vote in the Senate to pass Obama's massive socialized healthcare
plan.

Our contacts are also warning us that Obama's oppressive $2 trillion
global warming Carbon Tax also may be fast-tracked!

Ashe, your grassroots pressure forced the Senate to remove
this procedural trickery from the Obama budget just a few weeks ago.
But now a handful of Congressmen and the Obama team are sneaking the
fast-track language back in the budget!

+ + We have just a few hours to stop socialized healthcare
       and the oppressive Carbon Tax!

The House-Senate conference is meeting NOW and Obama's supporters
want to pass the revised budget this week in time for the conclusion
of Obama's first 100 days in office.

THIS IS A TOTAL OUTRAGE!

Democrats know they cannot get 60 votes in the Senate to pass
socialized healthcare or the Carbon Tax, so they are manipulating
the process to require only 50 votes later this year.

+ + Fax Congress Now And Say "No" To Fast-Tracking
       Socialized Healthcare and the Carbon Tax

We have set up our FaxFire to target the eight members of the
House-Senate conference along with your two Senators and your
Representative.

          We must flood these offices with faxes TODAY and
          tomorrow. Go here to schedule your faxes for
          immediate delivery:

http://www.grassfire.net/r.asp?U=18579&CID=112&RID=12844762

As always, if you would prefer to send your own faxes, please do so!
We provide all the contact information and sample letters for your
convenience at the above link.

+ + Classic Political Misdirection

Here's how this all happened...

A few weeks ago you helped Grassfire expose the Obama budgets
$2 trillion in new taxes and the plan by Democrats to fast-track
pet socialistic programs. The Senate removed the fast-track
language and it seemed to many that we had won this part of
the debate.

As a result, the liberal media -- and even the conservative media --
dropped the issue.

Then, after the Spring recess, Rahm Emanuel went to Harry Reid's
office and struck a deal to put the fast-track provisions back in.

Now, we have just hours to stop this. So...

After you send your faxes...

Please call these key members of Congress:

Call your two Senators:

Sen. Burr  202-224-3154
Sen. Hagan  202-224-6342

Call your Congressman:

Rep. Butterfield 202-225-3101

Again, this is classic D.C. back-room politics. We must take a
stand. Please schedule your faxes and make your phone calls.
Then, alert your friends.

Thanks for taking a stand at this crucial time.


Steve Elliott, President
Grassfire.org

P.S. If we lose the battle over socialized healthcare, more than
half of all Americans will earn their living off the government!
This is the tipping point -- the point of no return -- when our
country will become a socialist state like much of Europe.

Governor Purdue

I am very disappointed that you did not attend the 75th Anniversary Celebration of the GSNP. 

The far western counties have always felt a disconnect to our government in Raleigh.  Maybe we need to secede and become part of Tennessee.

The influx of tourists that we experience in Graham County and WNC in general from park visitation would be worth your acknowledgement of the contribution of this economic driver in our region of the state.

Time for Action on Smokefree Workplace Legislation

Every Worker Deserves a Safe Workplace; No one should have to Needlessly Sacrifice their Health for a Pay Check

The smokefree workplace bill (SB205) will come up in the Senate Health Committee tomorrow (Wed, Apr. 29) and then go up for a vote in the full Senate on Thursday (Thu, Apr. 30). Now is the time to strongly urge Senators to pass a clean version of the bill without the House amendment that exempts establishments with workers and patrons that are 18 and up.

Please call Senators’ offices and send in emails urging them to pass a clean version of SB205 that protects all NC workers and patrons, not just those in 18 and under establishment. Find talking points here (<http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg78cczz_5fsgbczfv>http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg78cczz_5fsgbczfv) on why the exemption is so detrimental and why the Senate should not pass a similar amendment.

Full Senate: Here is a link (<http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw>http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rOY8NIdSX3hsD6MjcFoMKMw) to info on our Democratic Senators, there are 29 listed. The main floor vote will be Thursday. Please call as many as you can, especially your Senator and those from your hometown (the one's with "Y" in the Sponsor column are sponsors of the bill; we just need to thank them for their support and remind them to show up and vote for a clean bill.)

Over the past 20 years Scott has been a leader in many successful efforts to change public policy. During the 1990s, he led the campaign to include the $500 per-child credit and capital gains tax cuts in the Contract with America. These tax cuts were the eventual centerpieces of the 1997 tax bill and the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.

He has been the creative force behind the Tax Foundations Putting a Face on AmericaÒ’s Tax Returns project and the State Business Tax Climate Index, two programs that are changing the terms of the tax debate at the federal and state level.

Scott has written and edited three books on the federal budget and streamlining the government and has authored over 100 studies on tax policy and government spending.

He has also authored dozens of editorials and opinion pieces for publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, The New York Post and The Washington Times. Hodge has conducted over 600 radio and television interviewsincluding NBC Nightly News, CBS Nightly News, CNN, Fox Network, Hardball with Chris Mathews, and C-SPAN. In addition, he has contributed to stories on wasteful spending aired by ABC's "Prime-Time Live" and "20/20," and NBC's "Fleecing of America."

Before joining the Tax Foundation, Scott was Director of Tax and Budget Policy at Citizens for a Sound Economy. He also spent ten years at The Heritage Foundation, including eight years as Heritage×’'s Grover Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs.

Scott began his career in Chicago where he helped found the Heartland Institute in 1984. He holds a degree in political economy from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Comment: SEANC District 5 will be conducting our annual meeting on Thursday, May 21, 2009, at Western Piedmont Community College in Morganton, North Carolina. District's 5, 6, and 7 are all located in Burke, Caldwell, and McDowell Counties and are very proud to have over 5,000 state employees as members of SEANC. The District 5 meeting will start at 6:00 PM with a catered meal and our Business Session will start at 7:00 PM. We are requesting that Bev honor us with her presence as our 'Guest Speaker'. I don't believe we have ever had any Governor attend any of our annual meetings in the West and this year would be a great year for our boss to attend. I would be happy to forward a full agenda for the evening's activities.

I would like to submit my application and resume for consideration in being appointed to a seat on the North Carolina Financial Literacy Council proposed in Senate Bill 1019.  I am very interested in this bill and have recent experience in financial literacy presentations as well as a collaboration with North Carolina State University's Master's of Accounting Program, which resulted in the first ever graduate class of its kind in the State.  It has garnered interest by the AICPA as well as other state CPA societies to help bring similar programs into the curriculum in their respective colleges and universities.  Please feel free to contact me via email at this address or by phone at 919.559.8550.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to talking to you soon.

Regards,

Governor,

I am writing in support of extending commissioner Sellers’ appointment.  She has been a strong and fair advocate for injured employees and at the same time recognizes challenges employers and insurers face in complying with workers compensation laws and statutes.  Her experience is important to her operation.

I did not receive a reply to my invitation to judge Senior Boards on May 14th.  We are getting down to the line and we need judges. At this late date am I to assume that the governor will not be able to attend?

Warmest regards,

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Second Recovery Workshop on Monday


	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>


Economic Recovery Workshop in Western N.C.

Gov. Bev Perdue and the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold the second in a series of statewide economic recovery workshops to provide information to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered.

Gov. Perdue will speak at the May 11 workshop, to be held at 12p.m. in Haywood Community College’s Charles M. Beale Auditorium in Clyde, N.C.

Workshop attendees will hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds, who will discuss the current status of funds, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

Additional workshops will be held in Greenville, Charlotte, Raleigh and Wilmington in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. For more information, visit <http://www.ncrecovery.gov/>www.NCRecovery.gov.

Governor Perdue Announces Public Water Supply Projects

Gov. Perdue today announced that nearly $40.5 million will be awarded to 35 communities in 28 counties for public water supply projects from the first-round distribution of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

“These projects will create jobs, boost the economy and improve public water supply infrastructure in all parts of North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue.

Project awards made by the Division of Environmental Health totaled $40,381,153. Towns from Kill Devil Hills – for tank mixers to improve water quality – to Andrews – for storage lagoon replacement – to Green Level for an elevated storage tank – will benefit from the program.

Johnston County, Green County, Catawba County, Perquimans County, Morehead City and Farmville, were each awarded the maximum amount allowed by the ARRA program: $3 million. The full list of first-round award recipients is now available at:  <http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm>www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/pws/recovery.htm.

Six of the 35 first-round projects to receive funding are “green” projects that include public water supply treatment upgrades and waterline replacements. Round One funding committed for these projects is nearly $4.3 million. Since the ARRA requires that at least 20 percent of all the monies awarded be spent on green projects, approximately $9 million will be available for eligible green projects in Round Two funding.

Governor Perdue Creates StreetSafe Task Force to Reduce Repeat Offenders

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced the StreetSafe Task Force, an initiative to reduce the number of ex-offenders who commit crimes after their release from prison.

The task force will bring together faith-based organizations, non-profits, local and state government agencies, business leaders and members of the community to develop a plan to combat recidivism and reintegrate offenders safely into the community.

"Citizen and community safety is a major priority in North Carolina,” said Perdue.  “StreetSafe will protect our communities, prevent ex-offenders from repeating crimes and provide them with the support they need to restart their lives.”

Attorney General Roy Cooper and Correction Secretary Al Keller will serve as co-chairs of the StreetSafe Task Force.

“Law enforcement officers too often see criminals they’ve arrested and convicted go right back to their old ways as soon as they get out of prison,” Cooper said. “Stopping criminals from repeating their crimes will make all of us safer.”

"It will take a commitment from all of us to address the challenges faced by ex-offenders” Keller said. “The work of the StreetSafe Task Force will benefit everyone who is working to help ex-offenders become productive taxpaying citizens."

Studies show that 36 percent of ex-offenders in North Carolina are sent back to prison for committing new crimes within three years of their release.  StreetSafe can provide an avenue for ex-offenders’ safe reentry into communities across North Carolina and for developing a network of support for them.

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/UploadedFiles/2f559969-62d8-47c9-81b0-3c7e9165c298.pdf>Governor Perdue signed Executive Order No. 12 creating the StreetSafe Task Force (PDF).

Governor Perdue Receives School Connectivity Awards

On Thursday, Governor Perdue received three awards for her leadership on school connectivity.  She received the Leadership in Distance Learning Program Administration Award from the NC Distance Learning Association, the Outstanding Leadership by an Individual in the Field of Distance Learning from the U.S. Distance Learning Association, and the USDLA Eagle Award.

Governor Perdue received the awards at the School Connectivity Celebration, celebrating that all 115 K-12 public school districts in North Carolina are now connected to the North Carolina Research and Education Network (NCREN).

Governor Announces ARRA Funding for NC Americorps Programs

Gov. Perdue this week announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service received $891,387 in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funding to expand the capacity of four of its existing AmeriCorps programs.

“This funding makes sure that our AmeriCorps programs and the important services they provide will continue to benefit the people of North Carolina,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Through these programs, at-risk children and families in need will continue receiving the services they need.”

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=347>For a list of the programs that will receive funding click here.

The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service, a federal and state-funded agency housed in the Governor’s Office, administers funding for North Carolina AmeriCorps programs.  For more information on the AmeriCorps programs, visit <http://www.VolunteerNC.org>www.VolunteerNC.org or call 1-800-820-4483.

Biotechnology Firms to Add 128 Jobs in Wake County

Bayer CropScience LP, a leading plant science company specializing in crop protection, non-agricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology, will expand in Wake County.  The company plans to create 128 new jobs and invest $10.2 million during the next five years in Morrisville.

“North Carolina is a recognized world leader in biotechnology manufacturing and research,” Gov. Perdue said. “Our state continues to support the expansion of global companies attracted by our top-rated business climate, knowledge-based workforce and unparalleled quality of life.”

The state’s Economic Investment Committee met today and voted unanimously to award a Job Development Investment Grant to Bayer CropScience LP to facilitate this expansion.  While wages will vary by position, the average annual wage for the 128 new jobs is $101,018 not including benefits, which exceeds the Wake County average wage of $43,160.

The company plans to open the Bayer CropScience Research and Development Innovation Center in Morrisville, leasing existing laboratory and office space to conduct basic plant research across a range of technology and crop platforms.  Additionally, the Innovation Center will house the company’s BioAnalytics and Regulatory Affairs functions, which support the development and commercialization of biotech products.

Rowan County Gets New Textile Manufacturer, 223 Jobs

Sustainable Textile Group LLC, a national manufacturer of fabric made from pre-consumer waste, will establish a new facility in Rowan County.  The company plans to invest $11 million and create 223 jobs in China Grove during the next two years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“North Carolina continues to support growth in our evolving textile industry and offers companies the opportunity to adapt and tap into new markets,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Our state is the ideal place for companies to relocate and expand, thanks to our skilled workforce and top business climate.”

Sustainable Textile Group LLC is part of the Sustainable Solutions Network of companies, which includes Sustainable Solutions Inc., Strateline Industries LLC and Circle LLC.  The companies offer a wide range of sustainable products and services.  Those include non-woven fabrics made from regenerated cotton fibers.  The fabric is used in items such as personal wipes and other non-woven materials for the home furnishing, medical and automotive industries.

Gov. Perdue's Statement Regarding the H1N1 Virus

As you know, North Carolina is one of 38 states with a confirmed case of the novel H1N1 flu virus.  As of today, North Carolina has 7 confirmed cases in Onslow, Craven and Carteret Counties.  The patients have been in isolation, and a thorough investigation already has been conducted by local and state public health officials.

Let me reassure you that North Carolina is as prepared as any state in the country.  We have national models for preparedness and response, and we are in constant contact with the CDC.

I want to thank public health officials including the Public Health Command Center, the State Lab and the many local health departments that have been working around the clock since the beginning of this outbreak.  I also would like to thank State Health Director Dr. Jeffrey Engel and DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler for their leadership.

In addition to our public health officials, we all play a part in keeping this disease from spreading.  Practice good hygiene, wash hands with soap and warm water, and cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.  If you are sick, don't go to work or to school but stay home.  If your child is sick, keep them at home.

By working together, I am confident we can protect the public health of North Carolina.

Sincerely,






For more information, call our NC CARE line at 1-800-662-7030 or log on to <http://www.ncdhhs.gov/>ncdhhs.gov or <http://www.cdc.gov/>cdc.gov.

Christy.....Our group would very much appreciate it if you could pls fwd this to Mayo. Also, inform Mayo that he can print out pgs 14 & 15 from this week's WFS newsletter edition (encl.). Also encl. is his bio right off of your Commission's website, indicating Mayo's interest in Arlington Place. The HB643 introduced by Rep. Tucker begs the question as to the real purpose of this bad legislation being introduced, especially given the fact that The Charlotte Observer is also reporting on other goings-on regarding real estate transactions and our politicians who stand to benefit at the expense of NC taxpayers.

Also, I'd like to have all of the commissioners' signed disclosure statements sent to me. This is the very reason we have heartburn about several NC Wildlife Commissioners (due to their lack of disclosure and conflicts of interest) and knowing that these positions, like positions on the NC Ethics Commission, are 'appointed' by certain NC politicians.

Re: Boddie-Noel



Dear Sir,



Your reputation of unscrupulous business practices has caught up with you.



Having Rep. Tucker draft a bill that threatens the already contaminated Castle Hayne Aquifer by injecting reuse water into the Aquifer was only a cover up.





The cover up is two parts:



1. Onslow Water and Sewer saltwater intrusion from the dewatering of the Castle Hayne Aquifer by the PCS Mine. While questions swirl as to how functional the mine really is, a group of water thieves are planning in selling the contaminated discharge water back to Greenville and Raleigh. The dewatering of the Castle Hayne has to stop immediately and permanently to attempt to let the aquifer recharge. Natural recharging will never correct the contamination of the aquifer, but may stop the saltwater intrusion that is threatening all municipal water treatment plants on the east coast 
2. Bad science confirmed by the "Hercules Project" that failed miserably indicates NO form of sewer discharge should be injected into the aquifer. With the  "Hercules Project" having failed in the adjoining county of New Hanover and did not stop saltwater intrusion means the only purpose of the Bill was to cover up the illegal marketing of building lots with non operational sewer treatment capacity at your Arlington Place development.


Your greed is appalling and totally ignores the health and well being of the Marines and families stationed at Camp Lejeune and the campers at Camp Seagull and Seafarer who not only have to drink the water but bathe in the toxic water also.



As you are only on the NC Ethics Commission to protect the past and current administrations and the total environmental corruption, misappropriation of public trust funds, and gambling boats of the "Developmental Devil's Triangle" (River Dunes, Cutter Bay, and Arlington Place), the citizens and taxpayers of North Carolina have the Right to Know of your role in this corruption.



"Waterfront Sportsman" and "Citizens Speaks TV" will be getting the facts out and are calling for your resignation from the NC Ethics Commission.



Your ignorance of the risk of reuse water to produce will not be tolerated. Your ignorance of this problem, disregard to public health and safe, and greed is surely reflected in the sourcing of produce and food stocks of the Hardee's, Texas Steak House, Carolina Café and Moe South Grill restaurant chains.



While your insensitivity is bad, so is your timing with an estimated 250,000 motorcycles coming from all over the United States to North Carolina to support the Waterfront Sportsman's Motorcycle Passion Ride for Water Quality. "Waterfront Sportsman" and "Citizens Speaks TV" has called for the total boycott of all Hardee's, Texas Steak House, and Moe's Southwest Grill nationwide.



I am sure the message will travel quickly as we will be adding your corporate headquarters on our map of corruption and contamination.

Good morning:

Would Governor Perdue appoint Judge Jerry Braswell (919) 731-2750) to a special judgeship since one retired in April?  He is a former legislator and served as a judge for 10 years before the November elections.

Thank you for your consideration.
