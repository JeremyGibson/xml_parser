My sister and I own a home in Franklinton. We refinanced it through HSBC last February with cash-out to get money for repairs and taxes. The payment/interest were high due to a past bankruptcy we had but they were the only lender that would refinance us at the time. They promised us that in 6 mos. we could reinance again and lower the interest rate (is 12%now)-when we went back,they didn't want to talk to us about it and still don't. We have been approved twice for FHA loans but HSBC won't let go of the loan. We asked to have the interest lowered or the amount lowered to lower the payments, the lady told us "too bad-you owe the money, pay it". Our house will go into foreclosure in the next few months as we are behind now 45 days. The government program for Hud/Hope Now is not even in place. The housing counselor told us they don't even have a lender to help people with this nor has the bill passed! We don't want to lose our home but we are now looking for a place to rent, with not much luck. When does the government help people like us? We're not bad people. We took care of our elderly parents for 16 yrs. in NYS and my brother sold the house and got all the money, we had to move after 50 yrs. of living in that house. We had to file bankruptcy in Florida after moving there due to our parents medical bills we paid-the rest of the family did nothing to help us and still isn't. We are in our 50's and just want to keep our home-Can someone help?? Thank you, Dona Miller

Dear Mr. Bagato:



The Office of Governor Beverly E. Perdue referred your inquiry to the Office of the Commissioner of Banks for any assistance this office may be able to offer you.



It is true there is no assistance for mobile home owners, if you have a retail installment loan.  However, if you have a regular mortgage, your circumstances may be different.



If you are interested in having your mortgage company review your loan for workout options that may be available to you at this time, please file a formal complaint with this office.



Please file your complaint on-line at our website: <http://www.nccob.org/>www.nccob.org



Go to our website, then click on the Consumer Assistance block.  Once on the Consumer Assistance page, you will find a link to our complaint form.  Fill out the form and submit it.  Print a copy of the completed form, sign it, and either fax or mail us the signed copy.  Once we have received the signature copy and any documentation pertinent to your complaint, we can contact the company on your behalf.



Please be aware that filing this complaint does not guarantee that your mortgage company can modify your loan or provide you with a workout plan.  What we can provide is making sure that your complaint gets to the right department within your mortgage company and is responded to with details of what options, if any, may be available to you at this time.



If you have further questions regarding filing a complaint, please contact our office.



Regards,



Karen E. Mizell

Subject: 1st Time Homebuyer Stimulus

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, I am a disabled veteran. I puchased my first home in November 2008. I filed taxes in 2009 and received the $7500 tax credit for first time homebuyers for the 2008 stimulus. The most recent stimulus just approved raises that credit to $8000 and provides that it does not have to be paid back. I am being told by my mortgage company representative that I will have to pay it back because I purchased in November 2008 instead of January 2009. I am writing to you because this is totally outrageous and unfair. The money I just received in 2009, the $7500, is being used to stimulate the economy. I have to pay it back because I closed on my new home in November 2008, under the 2008 stimulus. Please do something to make this money ($7500) a permanent credit that does not have to be repaid. The permanent credit should apply to the $7500 as well as the $8000. Why should one American have to pay the first time homebuyer credit back back and another should not. This is not fair and I am praying you will do something about it. I have faithfully served my country and hope to be treated fairly. Sincerely, Jason Byerly
