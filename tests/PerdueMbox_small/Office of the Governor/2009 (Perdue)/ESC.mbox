Ms. Christmas' claim was ruled ineligible for UI benefits from 11/16/08
through 1/17/09 due to losing her employment due to substantial fault.
If she continues filing weekly and is still unemployed and actively
seeking employment after 1/17/09, she will begin receiving her weekly
benefits of $494.00.  Ms. Christmas was mailed a determination with this
information on 1/6/09.

I have not received this notice as of today Jan 13 2008. I would like to appeal this decision as soon as possible. Can you please email tme the form sent via the mail.  I had a stable job that I was doing fine at prior to going to Queens. Prior to hiring me they told me they had plenty of business. The first day I started working there they took me to lunch and advised me that there business was bad.
Why did't they tell me that before I quit my other job?  During the entire time I worked there the main topic was always lack of  business and lack of hires for the entire office.  Frances also told me that I was about 10 years to old for her to promote into management.
She told all of us about 6 weeks prior to me losing my job that business was bad and she would need to make some changes if it did not get better. In the last two months that I worked there we had a total of 5 hires and out of those 3 were mine. Including a perm fee of $23000 that they will received this month.  I know that I did not have enough sumittal and hire but niether did anyone else in the office.
I content that I was too old and that for what ever reason I did not fit in there group and the fact that she did not like me.
Please advise

Joanne Christmas

I telephoned Ms. Thomas to inform her that her claim had been
adjudicated yesterday, 1/12, and that she was found eligible for UI
benefits.  A debit card will be mailed to her this morning and should
take a week to ten days.  At present 7 weeks of benefits are on the
debit card.

I also discussed with Ms. Thomas what seemed to be happening when she
visited the Fayetteville Local Office.  She would attempt to file her
weekly certifications by computer at the local office and would receive
a message stating that her claim had been revoked.  Each time she would
question it, staff seemed to treat her "strangely" and twice asked to
see her Social Security card.  I asked her if she had ever had any
problems with identity theft, as this sounded like a message our
computer system would generate if another claim had been filed with the
same SSN.  I cannot imagine why the local office staff did not explain
the problem to her, especially when she could prove she was the true
owner of that SSN.  Ms. Thomas is satisfied with our apology, thrilled
to be receiving her benefits and glad to know what was happening.  I
have forwarded the problem in the Fayetteville local office to the
proper channels for discussion and customer service training as necessary.

I reviewed Mr. Matthew's UI claim to be sure that we had correctly
applied UI law.  The original Adjudicator's decision was that he
admitted staying on the job for 6 years when he conditions were the same
from the date of hire.  UI laws do not allow payment of benefits when an
individuals puts up with adverse conditions for that long and then quits
because of those conditions.  Mr. Matthews appealed that decision and,
during the appeals hearing, two witnesses testified that the manager had
always cursed at Mr. Matthews and most other employees.  This testimony
served to enforce the ruling of the Adjudicator.  The Appeals Referee
affirmed the Adjudicator's decision and then Mr. Matthew's appealed to
the Commission.  The attorney representing the Commission affirmed all
prior decisions.  As of this date, Mr. Matthews as not informed us of
any further appeals and his appeal rights have expired.

I telephoned Mr. Matthews saying that I wanted to see if he had any
questions about the way his UI claim had been handled and about the way
the UI law had been administered.  When I explained that  the ruling
from the Adjudicator was based upon the fact that he waited for six
years to quit, he seemed to see everything in a new light.  I think he
wanted someone to understand that he shouldn't have had to take the
"abuse;" he just took it too long.  Although he still wasn't happy to
not be receiving UI benefits, he was pleased to have been contacted and
was glad to finally understand the process and the decision.
Additionally, I suggested several other state agencies that might be of
help to him.  When he kept wanting some way to tell someone about how
his employer acted, I referred him to the Dept. of Labor to file a
complaint.  Mr. Matthews did tell me that he was approved for Food
Stamps this morning.

Ms. Green
Thank you for your quick response. I will have them both, Phillip Taylor and Jared Gartland contact you. Please send your phone number as I do not have the Social Security numbers and would feel more comfortable if they called you with that info. Jared Gartland is supposed to be having a debit card UPS'd to him today by paying a fee of $15.00. I do not understand that. Why are recipients being charged a fee to UPS a debit card when they have been told over the phone that the funds were mailed or deposited and then after days or weeks be asked to pay a fee to get it quickly. He was first told the payment was deposited into a checking account on December 30, 2008. He has been going back and forth with this and finally is supposed to receive his debit card by tomorrow.  The same thing happened with Phillip Taylor back in November 2008. Please forward your phone number and I will have them contact you.
Thank you

Please contact me with the names and last 4 digits of the Social

sons.  Governor Perdue has asked our office to investigate their claims
for UI benefits and to respond to them and to her regarding the status

I telephoned Mr. Lewis and explained to him that the laws governing UI
benefits precluded the Adjudicator and the Appeals Referee from ruling
for his being eligible because he quit his job to relocate with his
spouse.  He felt that the fact of his mother-in-law's illness should
have been taken into consideration, but I explained that the laws and
regulations do not take reasons for relocating into account.  I
explained to Mr. Lewis that only legislators can change the law
governing UI benefits and that we must apply it to claims as the law
currently exists.  Mr. Lewis plans to contact the legislator
representing the NC County of his last residence to lobby for a change
of law.

I further suggested that Mr. Lewis appeal the determination of the
Appeals Referee when he receives it in the mail in case there was some
technicality in the hearing that the Commission attorney reviewing the
case could use to reverse the original decision.  He seemed to
appreciate the contact from ESC.

should deal with each of them rather than going through you in case I
have specific questions or they want to ask me questions.

Thanks for letting us know of their concerns.

I telephoned Ms. Lawrence and explained to her that she had filed two
weekly certifications, week ending dates 1/10/09 and 1/17/09.  She did
not realize that the week ending 1/10 was a nonpayable waiting period
week and that we would not have even sent a debit card until she filed
for the week ending 1/17/09.  She filed that week on 1/21/09.  I
explained that it takes one week to ten days to first receive the debit
card.  Ms. Lawrence seemed very appreciative of the explanation and
willing to wait for the card once she understood the timing.

I telephoned Mr. Blue last Friday.  He was attempting to file a new UI
claim because his UI benefit year had expired.  For some reason our
computer system was blocking him out and not allowing the new claim to
be filed.

I told Mr. Blue that someone from our Remote Services Center would
telephone him by close of business, Tuesday, 1/27/09 and asked him to
let me know if that did not occur.  I have just been notified that Mr.
Blue's claim has been filed and all should now work well with his claim.

I also told Mr. Blue to please call me in the future with this claim if
he has any questions or concerns so that he can get through.

Email: NCJILLIAN@YAHOO.COM

Subject: Unemployment Timeframes Issue

Comment: I wanted to express how I feel about the current issue going on
with the North Carolina Employment Security Commission. I filed a claim
on Dec 15,2008. I understand that it takes time to process claims. I
also understand that ESC is backed up right now. I called yesterday and
spoke to someone at ESC in Raleigh. They told me that there was no
timeframe or cap as to when the claim had to be complete. I have funds
in Unemployment from hard work and I have no time-frame as to when I am
going to begin receiving payments? I am two months behind on all my
bills. I will not have a car or a place to live if I don't get my money
within the next week. I cannot believe that NC does not have a
time-frame on these payments. I am a former employee of American
Express. If AMEX processed a dispute claim for a customer we had to have
it resolved within 6-8 weeks by law. It is absurd that you can get a
charge disputed on your credit card in a set amount of time, but there
is nothing protecting North Carolinian's for months while we go without
pay from unemployment. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science,
I would be happy to go work for ESC right now if they need help, but
their are no listings in Winston-Salem.

Dear Mr. Black,

Thank you for the recent email to the Governor's Office sharing concerns
about the vendor that sends debit cards to individuals receiving
Unemployment Insurance.  Governor Perdue's staff forwarded your
communication to the Employment Security Commission for review and
response.  Please be advised the the debit card vendor was selected
through a competitive bidding process.  Of course, the goal of
competition in selecting a vendor was to provide the most cost effective
service to the citizens of North Carolina.  Although a North Carolina
employer is not the debit card vendor, North Carolina banking
institutions receive and dispense UI funds and receive a modest fee for
their participation in this very important financial transactions.

Again, thank you for your correspondence.  If you have questions or
comments, feel free to contact me as indicated below.

Renton, WA 98057

Dear Mr. Green:

Your concerns regarding the job orders listed by the  North Carolina Dept of Corrections (DOC) with the Employment Security Commission were forwarded to me. DOC is continuing to take applications for correctional officer positions in their locations throughout the state. The agency is in a hiring slow-down, not a hiring freeze. Correctional officers are considered critical positions as they affect public safety. Each opening is considered on a case-by-case basis and has to be approved by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections. When a position is approved it is important to have current applications available for consideration.

There are several Alan Greens registered with the Employment Security Commission, but only one Alan R. Green. In discussing your concerns with a DOC representative and using limited information, we think we determined that you have an active application with DOC but the application has a Goldsboro address. Your email indicated that you live in Renton, Washington. The DOC representative indicated that it is important to keep your contact information up-to-date. Your application was transferred to the Eastern Regional office due to the Goldsboro home address. She suggested you telephone the Eastern Regional office to update the application (ph: 252-756-5501). The more locations you specify where you are willing to work will improve your chances for consideration should an opening be approved.

The Alan R. Green registration with the Employment Security Commission, however is inactive, which means that you will not be considered for any positions that are listed with us. You can reactivate and update your registration from our website at <http://www.ncesc.com/>www.ncesc.com.

We empathize with your frustration but encourage you to have patience. In reviewing our job openings, there may be other positions for which you qualify, so please take a look. I hope this information has been helpful and wish you the best in your endeavors.

No there has not been any mention of that. There has been mention of
adding $25 to each check. There will probably be a tier III of benefit
extensions.

Dear Mr. Blyther:

Thank you for the recent inquiry concerning job search assistance for
ex-felons.  Governor Perdue's office referred your email to the
Employment Security Commission for review and response.

See below contact information for the JobLink Career Center in your
area.   Typically, JobLink Centers have at least one employee who
devotes part of their time working with  individuals who have  what we
call  "significant " barriers to employment.   A prior felony conviction
is often a significant barrier.  Persons with such barriers are eligible
for intensive work search assistance.  If you have not already done so,
call the JobLink office and schedule an appointment with the counselor
or consultant in that office who performs intensive services.  Often
that employee will maintain a list of employers who have made a
commitment to helping former offenders successfully transition into
gainful employment.

I hope this information is helpful to you.  Best wishes.

have paid all my fees and pulled all my probation time. I have not been
in any more trouble since then. The reason I'm writing is because its
been 9 years and it is still hard for me to find employers to give me a
chance. I was wondering if there was some kind of program that helps
people like myself find employment that has made mistakes in the past
and is tring to be a better person. Like i said its been 9 years and i
haven't been in any trouble since. I have a family to support. and its
very hard when no one will give me a chance to prove that I have
changed. I guess what I'm asking for is, for you to shed some light on
what i can do to end this delma of obtaing jobs with a crimal record

Visitor: Mrs. carol carver

Address: 846 hugh woods road, roxboro, NC 27574

Email: carol.carver@ncmail.net

Subject: Beacon

Comment: I am a NC State employee at Central Regional Hospital. I would never of thought that I would have to worry about getting paid correctly. Since Beacon came into place there has been numerous problems with recieving my correct pay. There is also an issue in which the paycheck is not broken down to understand what I am getting paid for . Last year Wendy Griffin, manager of Payroll @ Best, worked on my pay issues. My pay was finally corrected by Wendy. She worked on my incorrect pay issues for several months. Just yesterday I was deducted almost $1600.00 dollars out of my pay. It was stated that I was over paid in July of last year. The person who noted this stated that Wendy approved this deduction to my pay six months after Wendy orginally went through my pay and corrected the alledged deficits. I have no accurate detailed evidence of being over paid. I received a spreadsheet from G.Krammer from Beacon in which I gave to HR at CRH to explain to me and they are unable. They lack understanding of any over payments to me. HR informed me that there is an active investigation about my pay being inaccurate. I do not understand how money can be deducted from my pay when there is an investigation going on. I am very upset by the lack of understanding about this situation. Please address the problems with the Beacon payroll system. I work hard for my money and believe that I am entitled to an accurate paycheck each and every month that I work. I do not believe that I should have to hire an accountant to decifer my pay. I should be able to look at my pay stub and understand it. I thank you for your interest in this matter, Carol Carver

Ms. McCall,
Governor Perdue's office forwarded your email message to Deputy Chairman
Clegg with the Employment Security Commission.  Mr. Clegg asked me to
investigate your son's UI claim and to respond to you on the his behalf.

As you probably know, your son was on a temporary layoff from his
employment with A-1 Copper Roofing in Stokesdale.  For a temporary, or
attached claim, the employer must file for UI benefits, rather than the
employee.  According to our records, on Tuesday, February 3, 2009, the
employer filed a claim effective January 11, 2009.  All new claims must
be effective on a Sunday date, so that was probably the Sunday prior to
the date your son was laid off.  The employer filed for two weeks of
benefits, week ending Saturday 1/17/09 and 1/24/09.

The first week on every UI claim is a non payable waiting period week.
Therefore, the only week we could pay benefits for your son was for the
week ending 1/24/09.  A debit card was issued on 2/4/09 with the
benefits for him.  It normally take a week to ten days for the debit
card to arrive by mail.

I regret that the employer did not file the claim for so long, but the
benefits were paid the day after the claim was filed with us.  Please
let me know if you have any further questions regarding this matter.

David Canady
Director of Unemployment Services
 <mailto:esc.ui.director@ncmail.net>esc.ui.director@ncmail.net

Dear Mr. Canady,

Until late November, I had worked for 32 years continuously, contributing to the unemployment funds of, first, Florida, and, then, North Carolina without complaint.

So when the Salisbury Post eliminated my position as managing editor in late November, I expected the state to help me and many others who have lost their jobs get through this difficult time.

I have found the state's system needlessly confusing and all but impossible to navigate. The state has provided no system of instructions that helps someone like me get through the bureaucratic morass, and employees of the local Unemployment Security Commission office have failed to provide key pieces of information. If I had not found out through other unemployed people, I would not have corrected the latest error in filing. And so far, I have yet to receive a single check.

Quite honestly, I find the system that is supposed to help me and others actually leaves puts the burden on us to unravel the many rules on our own. And I thought you and the board you serve as well as my local legislators should know it.

First, let me say I am one of the lucky ones because I have a seven-month severance package, and my wife still has a good job. So I have not suffered while I looked for a new job and tried to learn the many complex and conflicting unemployment rules. But I'm sure many others do not have that same support, and making it tough on them is not right. Plus, besides tuition and books for a class at RCCC, I'm also paying $6,000 in advance for only a six-month paralegal certificate program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and my wife and I are struggling to get help for our disabled daughter.

Here's a summary of what I have encountered:

On the advice of others who had lost jobs, I registered for unemployment on Nov. 30, 2008. At the time, I went to the Salisbury center on South Main and told the counselor I had already enrolled at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College and planned to take courses in January. He said I only needed to return with my schedule and enrollment papers, which I did in January, and that I could get benefits even though I was also getting my severance. I believe this is a very common practice and helps people cover the cost of going back to school.

When the benefits didn't start, I went online and learned that my case had been declared inactive and I would have to reapply in person at the Unemployment office. Maybe I'm denser than others, but no one told me I need to file the weekly certification report in addition to providing proof of my enrollment.

Also at that time, the counselor told me that the office had received papers from my former company which someone else had to read to me before my benefits could proceed. The person in question was out of the office and no one else could fine the papers. The counselor would or could not tell me the nature of the "papers."

The following week, I returned to the office and was directed to a manager who said the Post management had challenged my right to benefits, saying I left voluntarily. Had I known the nature of the "papers," I could have come to the office prepared with a copy of an e-mail saying my position had been eliminated.

Remember also that your office never contacted me about this challenge. If I hadn't gone in to reactivate my file, I might still not know.

I had to get documentation and make another trip to the office, where I also wrote a statement of my position on my job loss. The manager warned me that the "determination" in Raleigh could take months. That -- I'm pleased to say -- was also wrong. In two weeks, I got a letter saying my benefits had been approved.

 By this time, I am in my fourth week of school, and I expected to receive a check immediately. Then, earlier this week, another person who lost his job and was enrolled at RCCC  said he was not getting his benefits yet. When he went to the Unemployment Office, a counselor told him that despite the explicit language on the weekly certification questionnaire, he was not supposed to acknowledge receiving severance pay.

Keep in mind that the online report form warns you, first, that any false statement can be prosecuted as a felony. And the report then explicitly asks if you are receiving severance pay -- not mentioning any waiver for taking classes. Neither my friend nor I was told to essentially lie about receiving severance on the weekly report.

I called the Salsibury Unemployment Office today and a manager confirmed that I had not been receiving checks because I was reporting the severance. He said that your records show I have a waiver for enrolling at RCCC and I should not report my severance pay. Now that I had called, the manager said he would go back and change the records so that I will get two checks in arrears. Quite honestly, he seemed put out that I didn't know I was supposed to answer the weekly report incorrectly.

I was so astonished by the latest twist that I immediately sat down and wrote this e-mail. As I said previously, I might be dense because I have been lucky enough never to file for unemployment before and don't "know the system." But I consider myself an average, loyal taxpayer and citizen of North Carolina, and I think your system is horrendous.

Sincerely,

Dear Kelley,

Just a quick update on Ms. Lippman.  Ms. Lippman's UI claim was eligible
for extension.  She is currently receiving benefits.  She is also
registered with the Durham JobLink for job search assistance.

Have a great weekend.

Mr. Ledbetter had a severance issue on his claim.  However, he did not
file his weekly certifications after filing his initial claim for UI
benefits and, therefore, our computer system did not notify staff of an
outstanding issue.  After four weeks with no weeks filed, the system set
an arbitrary one year disqualification on his claim.  Our staff has
already "capped" that disqualification.  Following overnight processing,
payments should be released tomorrow.  We will check the claim in the
morning to be sure that all is well.

Visitor: Mrs. Marsha Waterhouse

Address: 204 Hiatt Dr, Thomasville, NC 27360

Email: marshawaterhouse@hotmail.com

Subject: Medicaid/Unemployment

Comment: I was recently laid off and my husband also lost his job. We
tried to get help from the local social service office but we were told
because of a motorcycle we purchased 8 yrs ago we are unable to receive
any help until we sold it. Today, no one is purchasing vehicles of this
type. Why am I being passed over for help because of when we were
employed we made this purchase (and we struggled to pay for it). It
wasn't that much. Lord knows there are thousands of people out there who
are lying to get such help and of course me being honest gets me
nothing. Any suggestions? Also, people who are drawing unemployment
benefits should NOT have to claim this money at the end of the year. We
are STRUGGLING enough as it is. For those who don't know, most of the
time your unemployment benefits are less than half of what your paycheck
used to be. And take into consideration that not only are you getting
less than half, but they want you to pay taxes on it and don't forget
the wonderful COBRA program, it was so expensive there was no way we
could afford that and eat to. Please GOV Perdue, please help us!!! One
more thing, the employment commission is so overworked, can't we get
some of the millions unemployed a job here. My husband is having to
prove his claim, which was made 1/7/2009 and to this date they can't
tell us anything except to expect it to be 6-8 weeks before the process
even begins. Again, what do we do in the mean time? Starve, lose
everything!! Thanks, Marsha Waterhouse

Mr. Morris attempted to file a claim for UI benefits on 1/16/09.
During overnight processing, some error that he made caused the claim
to be held by our computer system.  Because Mr. Morris was unable to
come into our local office, resolving this error was difficult.

A staff member from our Remote Services Center contacted Mr. Morris on
Monday, 2/16/09 and corrected his claim.  It was backdated to 1/16/09.
She took a fact-finding about the reasons for his discharged from the
last employer and about his availability for work if he cannot leave
his mother to come to the ESC office for work search.

  State misleading its students

RALEIGH The long-running Leandro schools suit -- first filed in 1995 and still overseen by Wake Superior Court Judge Howard Manning --
is all about whether the state is fulfilling its constitutional duty to give every child the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.
It involves resources, teachers and principals and whether schools deliver on their promise.

But in a state that condones a public schools governance system that deliberately misleads the public and students, confuses taxpayers and
contributes to a dysfunctional administrative structure, it's a wonder schools perform as well as they do. Consider:

The Constitution requires statewide election of a Superintendent of Public Instruction every four years. The implicit promise is that this
superintendent will run the state's schools and be accountable to voters every general election. But it's a farce. The superintendent has
no power to do anything, and when voters wonder why their elected education official can't make schools perform better, they might
as well be wondering whether thunder curdles milk. It's a meaningless exercise.

*An empty position*

* *

**The Constitution also creates an appointed State Board of Education, and gives it oversight of public schools and the authority to delegate
power to operate the schools. In the past, the board has sometimes given that power to the Superintendent of Public Instruction -- such
as former Superintendents Craig Phillips and Mike Ward, who had the board's confidence. In others, the board has withheld that authority,
such as with former Superintendent Bobby Etheridge, now a member of Congress, and June Atkinson, the current superintendent.

This hydra-headed structure means that everyone is in charge and no one is in charge. Governors like to run on a ticket of becoming
education governors, and they appoint most of the members of the board. But the board often hires its own de facto schools superintendent
to run daily operations. It's no wonder that a consulting firm's study of our system labels it "dysfunctional." That's education jargon for
"a train wreck."

"From the perspective of thoughtful and consistent public policy, this shifting every few years of authority and roles has been confusing,
inconsistent and largely politically driven," asserts the report by Evergreen Solutions.

That study also noted that stakeholders in the education system thought the governance structure "is broken in North Carolina. It is an
impossible arrangement set up for failure and confusion" because no one knows where to go to get a consistent answer about schools policy.

*Logically bankrupt system*

* *

**A few weeks ago, Gov. Bev Perdue attempted to resolve some of the confusion over this logically bankrupt system of governance.
She announced that longtime State Board of Education Chairman Howard Lee will step down to take another education post; that
she will appoint Cumberland County Schools Superintendent Bill Harrison to the board, and that she wants the board to name
Harrison its new chairman and to make him the chief executive officer of N.C. public schools.

She did this with the state's university and community college leaders, as well as Superintendent of Public Instruction June Atkinson,
standing with her on a podium. Atkinson, the governor said, would continue as an ambassador to public schools and work on other
issues. Is there a more awkward post in government?

Perdue said she did not want to wait for the 18 months or two years it might take to change the Constitution to resolve the governance
issue. The state's schools and its students need clarity in policymaking now, and she is absolutely right.

But in avoiding a debate over whether to change the Constitution to either make clear that the superintendent is in charge, or perhaps
to abolish the job of superintendent, the governor is doing the same thing that the General Assembly has done for decades: ignoring a
mess that everyone knows cheats the public about who's in charge and deprives students of the best schools system the state could
give them.

Now the N.C. Public Schools Forum, an education think tank, has completed a study calling for a constitutional amendment eliminating
the elected superintendent's position and giving the State Board of Education authority to hire a Commissioner of K-12 Education.
It also recommended giving some appointments to the state board to the leaders of the state House and Senate. It's a good idea. If the
legislature wanted to take just one step to reassure the public about accountability for schools, this is it.

*Whose job is it?*

* *

**As former state Sen. Gerry Hancock, a Public School Forum board member, put it, "Whose job is it to solve the intractable problems
that affect our children?"

*Resistance to education governance change has always boiled down to politics.* The legislature doesn't want to be perceived
as taking a vote away from voters. But in sticking with that Jacksonian notion, it is complicit in a governance structure where no one
is really in charge -- and *where children are the ones who pay the price.*

*Correction:* In last week's column about school desegregation in Virginia and North Carolina, I named the wrong county that once
closed its doors rather than opening white schools to black students. It was Prince Edward County, southwest of Richmond, and
not Prince William County, near the Washington, D.C. suburbs.

When Mr. Perschka filed his weekly ceritification on 1/13/09, he
answered the question, "Are you receiving any other state/federal
benefits?" as Yes.  Although this was probably an error, every week
thereafter when he filed his weekly certifications, the system notified
him that there was an issue on his claim.  He did nothing to try to
resolve this issue.

We found the issue yesterday, contacted Mr. Perschka and found that the
answer was indeed an error.  We removed the issue and his benefits for
the week of 1/13 and all the weeks after were released following last
night's processing.

Ms. Foust came into the Burlington ESC office and met with the Local
Office manager on Friday.  She received two job referrals and the
manager reviewed her job resume.  He made a couple of suggestions for
minor revisions and gave her a booklet for resume preparation as well as
one for Job Seeking Skills for Older Workers.  Ms Foust requested to be
able to telephone him once a week about future job openings and he told
her to call him whenever she liked.

The scheduling of an appeals hearing for Ms. Witherspoon has been

the second or third week of March and then it would have been maybe six
weeks until her hearing would have been held.  Her hearing is now
scheduled for 3/10/09 at 9:00.  It will be a telephone conference
hearing.  She will receive a mail notice of this hearing this week.

Ms. Jones,
The Governor's office forwarded your email question to the Employment
Security Commission for a response.  When your husband filed for
Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, he was given an option of
receiving those benefit payments via a debit card or through direct
deposit into his checking account.  He did not send us a form requesting
direct deposit of UI benefits, so his claim automatically set up for
payment via debit card.

Whether claimants receive UI benefits payments via debit cards, direct
deposit, or when we used to mail checks, there are always delays from
mail and banking holidays over which we have no control.   Although you
indicated that  part of the problem was because our office was closed on
President's Day, Monday, February 16, were were not closed.  The
Employment Security Commission only observes state holidays, not federal
holidays such as President's Day.  It was, however, a bank and mail
holiday and it did affect UI benefit payments for our claimants.  If you
are aware of these holidays for the banks and the mail, you will be
better able to plan for a one day delay in future UI benefit payments
over which we have no control.  When our offices are closed, our
computers still process weekly certifications of UI claims and the
payments are still processed.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
regarding this matter.

Ms. Hendrix,

The issue with our computer system was resolved Friday night.  A refund
in the amount of $68.00 will be processed tonight and there should not
be any further delays in your benefits.

Hi Jane... I got your message regarding Ms. Judy from Barbara Rhodes.

The NC Employment Security Commission can only assist claimants whose
charging state is North Carolina.  Unfortunately, there is nothing we
can do for Ms. Judy, since she's a South Carolina claimant.  As a
courtesy, I'll call Ms Judy and explain that we can't help her because
she's a SC claimant.  I'll also encourage her to call the SC ESC and get
all information from them.  I don't want to try to give her any other
information for two reasons: 1) She's an SC claimant, and I don't know
SC ESC rules and regulations; and 2) NC rules and regulations (which I
know) don't apply to her.

Because we have access to other states' claim records, I did go to South
Carolina and check Ms. Judy's claim record to see what, if anything, I
could determine.  I noticed that her claim was effective on February 1,
2009.  She had a certification due for the week ending 2-7-09, which she
filed on 2-10-09.  Ms Judy did not file for the following two weeks
(2-14 and 2-21) until yesterday (2-24).  It appears that the SC ESC did
release two payments to her of $211.00 upon receipt of her filings on
yesterday.

Let me know if I can be of any other assistance.

Like many people I have had to file for unemployment.



However my claim is just sitting still, with  nothing happening for some
2 weeks or so.



Everything that I was asked of documents and the like, I produced.  More
than was requested.


I am told things are just sitting in adjudication for someone to make a
decision.  Entered adjudication the first week of Feb.  assigned on 9
Feb. and nothing since then.



How accurate this account is, I do not know.



Initially I was told that my employer had until 27 Jan. 09 to respond.
They did not. And that if they did not respond, my claim should
beginning payments shortly thereafter.



I believe I have been patient.  I believe all information has been
submitted.



What is taking so long?  Of course they are overloaded in that
department.  With all of the people out of work, where is the
justification for such a heavy work load.


People are suffering due to the slowness of the Unemployment System
here.  I was temporarily evicted or locked out, and found myself driving
around in my vehicle.



Why.  There should be far greater efficiency and concern for you
unemployed Citizens

Thank you for the recent inquiry about the status of Brenda Murray's
claim for Unemployment Insurance. For information and reference, a copy
of the original email is appended to the end of this message.

Our records reflect that the erroneous Adjudicator's Determination has
been Vacated and Declared Null and Void. A corrected determination that
ruled in Ms. Murray's favor was made today and should post to the
automated benefit payment system tonight. Within 24-72 hours, payments
for the pending weeks will post to her bank account.

I will call her this afternoon with the favorable outcome on her claim.

Please call if you have questions.

Can you help me have them correct this today....before I lose my

they won't step up and correct THEIR ERROR RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!Feb
21, 2009 sent to :

appeals ESC<esc.public.appeals@ncmail.net>

Will Caldwell, manager of this office, has supposedly submitted
everything for appeal. I ask you this......Why do I need to appeal when
I should not be disqualified in the first place? ESC made an error!!!!

(My contact information is included in the copy of the letter to Don
Griffin at bottom of this message)

I am writing to ask that someone help clear up an error that an ESC
employee made that is possibly going to make this claimant end up losing
transportation if the ESC does not move quickly to correct their own error.

I was notified this week that I was disqualified. ESC picked up the
wrong 'last employer' and while I did everything correctly and waited
patiently only to find that ESC made an error and instead of correcting
immediately they tell me that it may take 3 weeks or more to get it
cleared up. I was told by the local manager of ESC (Hickory) that he was
doing everything within his legal rights. I ask you "What are my legal
rights?!!!" I was let go from my last job after only 86 days and told
they did not think this was the job for me. My accuracy rate was 98%. I
asked to work more often than than would let me. I worked extra anytime
I was asked. I was told by my supervisor from the very beginning that
their training program left much to be desired. And, the position was
PRN (only as needed). I had no benefits. I was told when hired that most
of the people in the position were working 35 to 40 hours per week.
After a month I was usually only scheduled 30 hours or less......most of
the time making a few extra hours. I was not fired. I was not let go for
misconduct or negligence. I DO QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS.

Why doesn't someone with authority correct this for this innocent person
(ME)? Right away!!!!! Why am I penalized and must wait weeks more and be
unable to pay any of my bills?

It is very clear that YOUR employee made an error. Please look into and
correct immediately. I have not had a paycheck in over a month.

In an effort to get help with this I wrote ACTION 9 TV.......this was
before I saw your email address. I am unable to find a phone number to
get to speak with anyone at ESC directly that can help me. Following is
a copy of the letter to ACTION 9.................

CORRECT. I havent had a paycheck in 4 weeks. I have done everything

error!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear Mr. Griffin:

I was laid off my job from Catawba Valley Medical Center Jan. 16, 2009.
This was through no fault of my own. I went directly to the Employment
Security Commission (ESC) and filed my claim. I was instructed to call
1.866.278.3822 within 3 business days. I did so and the operator who I
finally got through to said they did not see it online and took the
information again over the phone. At this time he told me they were 6000
claims behind in inputting claims. I waited my turn but now they are
making me wait longer due to their error. I cannot wait that long
without losing my car.

The following is the message I have gotten every week since then is:

Your claim for the week of 1/31/2009 has been accepted but cannot be
processed for payment because there is an issue on your claim pending an
eligibility ruling. A determination will be made and mailed to you and
your claim will be processed accordingly.

This past Tuesday (Feb 17th) it finally said no issue but then I
received a letter saying I was disqualified. Here is the kicker.the ESC
sent their letter requesting why I no longer worked there to the wrong
last employer. THEY MADE A MISTAKE. The local ESC office knows and says
they will try to expedite but very dryly look at me and say they are
doing everything within the law. They tell me it could be 3 to 4 more
weeks before an appeal will be decided. THERE SHOULD BE NO APPEAL. THEY
MADE A MISTAKE THAT THEY SHOULD CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.

Thank you for your response to my request. Within 3 days I had a call for a very pleasant gentleman from the NCESC office who had done on research for me. Not sure what happen or how you guys did it but two days later I had two weeks payment from SC deposited in my bank account. So thank you all and please give that young man at NCESC a big ATTABOY and don't let him get away. He's a rare find.
Thanks so much,

I sent the following response to Mr. French explaining his claim to him,
why he did not qualify for the extension on his second benefit year and
how he can perhaps have his UI overpayment waived.  Please see below:

> Mr. French,
> The Governor's office sent your email message to ESC Deputy Chairman
> Clegg.  Mr. Clegg asked me to review your claim for Unemployment
> Insurance (UI) benefits and to respond to you on his behalf as soon as
> he received your email message.  The following is a summary of your
> records with our agency.
>
> On 10/14/07, you filed your first UI claim stating that you were laid
> off from your job with McKesson Medical-Surgical, Inc.  We did not
> receive a response from that employer about why you were no longer
> employed so there was no need for an adjudication process about your
> eligibility for UI benefits.  You were deemed monetarily eligible to
> receive $391.00 weekly for 26 weeks.  You exhausted those benefits on
> 4/19/08.
>
> On the week ending 7/12/08, we assisted you in filing a claim for the
> first extension, later called EUC08, Tier I.  You were eligible for 13
> additional weeks of benefits, exhausting this program on 10/4/08.  You
> then transitioned to the EB program and received one weeks of benefits
> on that program.  With the week ending 10/11/08, you completed the
> benefit year of your UI claim.
>
> With the next week, you filed a new benefit year and were found to be
> monetarily eligible to receive $343.00 weekly for 13 weeks.  You
> exhausted those benefits on 1/17/09.  Your claim then attempted to
> transition again to EUC08 and you were paid 4 weeks of benefits on
> that program.  It was then determined that you were not monetarily
> eligible for the extension program.  In order to be eligible for the
> extension, you must have worked for 20 weeks in full-time insured
> employment during the current base period (third and fourth quarter
> 2007 and first and second quarter 2008) or the equivalent.  To meet
> the "equivalent, your base period wages must be greater than 40 times
> the weekly benefit amount OR 1 1/2 time the high quarter wages.  I
> have checked these mathematical equations in your situation and you do
> not meet the criteria.  If you can show that you worked 20 weeks from
> July 2007 through June 2008, please let me know immediately.
>
> Because you were paid 4 weeks for which you were not eligible, our
> system has created an overpayment.  I see that you have filed a waiver
> of overpayment on 2/23/09.  We will have the decision on this waiver
> expedited in your case.
>
> Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns
> regarding this matter.

Dear Governor Perdue,



I'm extremely appalled at the fact that you would allow the bank of Wachovia to STEAL our money during this hard times. It's not enough to give billions of our hard earned dollars to bail out these low life scum just so they can waste it on needless spending you now allow them to STEAL our unemployment by charging outrageous card fees!!! You aught to be ashamed of your self for allowing this type of behavior to occur in this state!!!! I will try and contact a N&O paper and Fox50 to see if they would be interested about a story and also contact a couple of radio hosts Bill Lamay of 680WPTF & Alan Handlemen News Talk 101.1. This is hwy robbery in my opinion we are not given an option and we are being held at gun point by the bank and our state and are forced to pay these fees. How can you condone these fees?? It's not right!! 



SHAME ON YOU!

Visitor: Mr. Robert Kissel

Subject: Call made in Error from ESC-NC to Me, in Connecticut

Comment: [The following comment is an e-mail I sent to: david.clegg@ncmail.net, muriel.k.offerman@ncmail.net, thelma.hill@ncmail.net, manfred.emmrich@ncmail.net, bob.cottrell@ncmail.net, marycarol.lewis@ncmail.net, andrew.james@ncmail.net, esc.ui.net@ncmail.net, esc.public.appeals@ncmail.net. I wished to copy the office of the Governor, but cannot find an e-mail address to utilize on the Web site, so I have pasted the text of the e-mail here.] Some representative in your North Carolina Employment Security Commission placed a call, in error, to my phone, and left an urgent message on my answering machine, yesterday about mid-day, Eastern Time. She did not identify herself by name or provide a code to type in, or even state the full name of the person for whom she was leaving the message. She only said she was leaving word for someone named "Michael" and that it was essential that he call the agency back no later than 11:00 A.M. on Friday, because she needed him to submit a statement of some sort. I got only busy signals when I tried to telephone the number she left (866-278-3822). Today, when I called this number and finally connected, I tried to manoeuver my way through the menus, but ended up waiting indefinitely, and so I gave up on THAT. All I'm trying to do is let you know that SOMEONE (female voice, pronounced North Carolina accent) was trying to place a call to 203-287-9542 in Connecticut and to speak to someone named Michael. There's no Michael here, so she either mis-dialled the number or else has gotten an incorrect phone number on file, and the number she was trying to reach is probably very much LIKE our phone number. I'm just trying to do your agency a courtesy by letting you know, but I'm afraid it's quite impossible to get in touch with anybody in the agency at all--I'm just glad I'm not a citizen of North Carolina who happens to be in need of your help, because I think I might starve to death, as will this poor Michael, because I don't think he's going to be able to call back and provide whatever Miss Unknown wanted. I hope one of YOU will e-mail me back to reassure me that SOMEBODY got this e-mail and is doing something about this. I must also say, from my visits to North Carolina, it was my impression that residents of your state pride themselves on polite manners. How is it that a state employee places a call without IDENTIFYING herself properly, so that someone knows WHO has telephoned, and stands a chance of responding? I'm not a government employee, and the FIRST thing out of my mouth, on any telephone call, is an utterance to orient the caller and inform him who is speaking. "Hello; this is Robert Kissel, speaking." I think it's EXTREMELY rude--even if this representative had reached the correct party--for your state's employees not to say, right away, who they are, exactly and clearly, so that, especially in problematic situations, everybody knows what's going on. I think some training needs to be given to employees before they are allowed near the telephones to make calls! I hope the first name "Michael" (the person she was looking for), the date (March 11), the approximate time (midday) and my phone number 203-287-9542, are sufficient for you to figure out who telephoned with this urgent method and straighten her out so you can get in touch with this poor fellow, "Michael," and then I think you need to do a little better at communicating. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE HUMAN READ AND TREATED THE PROBLEM IN THIS EMAIL. Very truly yours, Robert S. Kissel
