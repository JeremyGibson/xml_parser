My name is Hillary Freeman and the reason for this letter that I am writing is because I have a huge concern about our inability to get government health assistance due to making to much money. My mother who does bot have insurance went to the health department yesterday to see about getting checked out. She has found a lump on her right breast and is very concerned about it. She does not work and has no health insurance. She recently got married and is having issue's with getting on to her hus bands insurance. This could be a life threatening illness and the health department refused to see her due to her husband making to much money.. How is this right? Just because it says he made that much doesn't mean he did. He owns his own business and has to pay out his employees and pay for supplies so really he didn't bring home all that money. And for her to no be able to be seen by the health department is wrong.. I really need some answers. Our system is awful. Not everyone can 

afford the extra monthly payment for health insurance. Especially in this day.Times are tight. So please contact me and answer some of my questions.

Hillary

Comment: On 01-12-09 my niece her husband and four children were left homeless due to a fire. She called her case worker for help with housing. She was told
that being homeless due to the fire was not enough to move her to the top of the list! They are having to stay with family! I was wondering what would they have to do to be able to get housing from our government! Her husband was fired from a job he had been on for two years just this week also. He worked at the Village Inn pizza place here in Morganton and due to the color of his skin the assistant Manager has set him up to fire, all she has working now are illegal immagrants! Our american job system! I can't figure out why people who try to make a life for themselves have such a hard time. We pay taxes for the money to be given away wastefully! Why can't they be moved up the section eight housing list? Why is there no support for people who don't commit crimes and are just hard working people? She has four children that are going to be moved around from house to house due to our non supportive government! I know that all the government housing in the morganton area is not being used and are sitting vacant! Why can't they get help due to the emergeny situation? Is there a homeless shelter they could go to in Morganton? No! Should she have to depend on the family to help her? No, most of them are retired and on a fixed income as it is. All we are asking for in some assistance! I am a tax payer and should have a say in what happens to my tax dollars! Your help would be greatly appreciated.If there is something we need to do that we have not done please let us know. They need a HOME! Someone should also investigate the things that go on in the employee system at Village Inn Pizza in morganton!

Dear Mr. Clark,

I am in receipt of your receipt correspondence to Governor Bev Perdue regarding your concerns about the Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) schools for the deaf and hard of hearing and the Office of Education Services.  I am the Director of the NC DHHS Office of Citizen Services.  For your information, the Office of Citizen Services is responsible for responding to inquiries and complaints that are within the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. This office also administers the CARE-LINE (1-800-662-7030) which is a statewide, toll-free information and referral telephone service.

Our office serves as a clearinghouse for information on the many human service programs offered in this state. The CARE-LINE Information and Referral Service as well as our e-mail service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. I also want to make you aware of the NCcareLINK.  Please visit <http://www.NCcareLINK.gov>http://www.NCcareLINK.gov for your connection to up-to-date information about programs and services offered across North Carolina.

I appreciate you sharing your concerns and offering ideas as to how we can better utilize department funding.  I will ensure that Secretary Lanier M. Cansler is aware of your suggestions.  As you probably know, the current state budget situation is being closely monitored, and DHHS is actively looking at ways to operate as efficiently as possible while also ensuring that we are delivering services in the most effective and safe manner to our consumers.  The department will evaluate your proposal for potential savings, taking these factors into consideration.  The department welcomes cost-saving suggestions and takes these suggestions seriously.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have further questions or suggestions.

Sincerely,
Melodee M. Stokes, Director
NC DHHS Office of Citizen Services

> Comment: To: Bev Perdue We have two deaf schools and one for blind in NC. If you look at South Carolina- SCSDB ( South Carolina for the Deaf and Blind) FSDB ( Florida School for the Deaf and Blind) ASDB (Alamaba school for the Deaf and Blind) and some other states whcih they only have one school in each state and have large nubmers of students compare to ours. NC wasted so much $$$ where you have so many staffs with low ratio of student. For example- Morganton have like 3 or 4 staff to one student. One school for the deaf or if u want to with blind will be enough and will save State's busget 10-15 million dollars a year. OES wasted alot of $$$ with too many staffs in Raliegh that they cant oversee deaf schools. It's cost taypayer about 100,000 per student a year. Why not merge into one school and it will save more $$$ What do you think?

Governor Perdue,

Per the attached letter, I appreciate your office forwarding our letter to
the division of HHS and for their politically correct response that perhaps
show how little they really understand.  We expected a total reform and
integration of NC medical services, private or otherwise, to create a system
of care which has equality for all citizens.  That was what the citizens
intended and that was total parity of mental health care.  Presently, we
have a separate care for mental illness and this is why a person with a
heart attack can get a bed in any hospital but a mentally ill patient
cannot.  Now that we have a law that says mental illness is equal, we expect
the governor to enforce it.  Perhaps, this can be accomplished with the
stimulus package and the abolishment of layers of government management that
does absolutely nothing for the patients.  It would also eliminate the
"beggar mentality" for mentally ill patients and the fear of their own
government.  We must start rolling back these excessive salaries for CEO's
of LME's and other branches of government.  We need bottom line and full
integrative medical services that includes prime care.  I know that you will
look into this because the problem has been here for far too long and you
are interested in solutions for all of us.

Thank you,

Emma, Bob Thorne
