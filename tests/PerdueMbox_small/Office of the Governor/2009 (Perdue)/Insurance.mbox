I spoke with Mrs. Parker.  The first thing we talked about was her low income level.  I wanted to see if she could be eligible for any assistance with her Medications through the Medicaid program or the Low Income Subsidy (LIS) program.  She verified that she is married and with the combined income of her and her husband, they are over the amount for the above programs and have checked into assistance before. 

I explained to her that the penalty is assessed through the Federal Government office of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is assessed if you did not sign up for a Part D plan when you were eligible to do so.  She has a Medicare Advantage plan that has a Part D plan with it and is being assessed the penalty on the Part D end.  I explained to her that she will need to enroll into a stand alone Part D plan to disenroll from her current plan unless CMS will allow her to drop the plan back to the inception date. She said that she called Medicare and they are going to drop the plan for her back to the inception date.  I explained to her that since she has monthly drug costs, that she may want to reconsider dropping the plan, even though she has a penalty, to help her with the drug costs.  She understands that she will need to contact Medicare to see if they are going to drop the plan and explain to them that she needs to enroll into a stand alone Part D plan if she wants to have drug coverage.  She has my name to call me back with further questions and also has the number to our SHIIP counseling site in her county where she can receive one-on-one counseling.

Do you know someone who is on Medicare and needs assistance in paying for their prescription drugs? Medicare beneficiaries may be eligible for the federal Extra Help low income subsidy program if he/she has limited income and resources. The Extra Help program can increase cost savings by paying for all or part of the month premiums, annual deductibles, and provide lower prescription co-payments under a Medicare prescription drug plan. To qualify for Extra Help, the annual income must be limited to $15,600 for an individual ($21,000 for a married couple living together). Additionally, the total resources must be limited to $12,510 for an individual ($25,010 for a married couple living together). The resources do not include a primary residence or a vehicle. If you believe someone you know may qualify for the Extra Help program, please encourage them to apply on-line at <http://www.socialsecurity.gov/>www.socialsecurity.gov, or contact our office toll free at 800-443-9354 and we may assist them with completing the on-line application process or send them a paper application.

Ms. Wright:  The Governor's Office has asked the Department of Insurance to respond to your concerns over the pre-existing condition clause.  I have attached a document explaining the pre-existing condition clause which should be helpful to you.  Also, following is a brief summary about HIPPA rights, and the NC Health Insurance  Risk Pool.  Hopefully this information will be helpful to you.

Except for a select group of individuals, known as HIPPA-eligible individuals, individual coverage may be fully underwritten by insurers – meaning that insurers may decline to offer coverage based on the individual’s health information. However, once an individual is covered, an insurer may not terminate or refuse to renew an individual policy unless it offers to each affected individual the option to purchase any other individual health insurance policy offered by the insurer. This feature is known as “guaranteed renewability.” Brochures regarding eligibility criteria and guaranteed purchase rights for HIPAA eligible individuals, the list of individual carriers as well as our Consumers Guide to Health Insurance can be found on the Department of Insurance website at <http://www.ncdoi.com/>www.ncdoi.com.



There is also a high-risk pool in the state of North Carolina that would provide coverage to individuals that are unable to obtain health insurance coverage because of pre-existing conditions and/or unaffordable rates.  The North Carolina High Risk Pool can be reached at

1-866-665-2117 or online at <http://www.nchirp.org/>www.nchirp.org.

Subject: Insurance Rates

Comment: Homeowners Insurance Rates to Increase! I have been a homeowner for the last 10 years. Luckily, I did not fall into the mortgage mess and still can afford my monthly payment. However, Insurance rates have kept increasing to outrageous amounts over the past years. Furthermore, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Jim Long, has yet passed another rate increase for North Carolina Residents. My rate has increase from $350.00 in 1998 to $1400.00 today not including the 30% increase to start in May. This is OUTRAGEOUS. I love owning my own home and understand insurance is a fact of life, but common, if rates keep going up I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME ANYMORE! Please do something to stop the latest proposed increase to home owners insurance. Thank You.

Subject: Excessive and Discriminatory Insurance Rate Increases For Coastal Residents

Comment: Governor Perdue...I am appalled and shocked at the discriminatory and excessive insurance rate and deductable increases that are being placed on the backs of hard working North Carolinians by the greedy insurance companies, the North Carolina Rate Bureau, and the North Carolina Department of Insurance. These types of rate increases are devastating to families who have lost their jobs and those that are on fixed incomes like mine. I am literally being forced from my home because excessive taxation and unbearable insurance rate increases. People are going to have to make tough choices. Do I buy food or medicine or do I give what little I have to greedy insurance companies who dont give a damn about nothing but their precious bottom line for their shareholders. State government is doing little if anything to keep the citizens of the 18 Coastal counties from being fleeced or run out of their homes. I was born and raised in Wilmington and New Hanover County but I may be forced to move elsewhere because of high taxes abd ridiculous insurance costs. What is state government doing for me,,the taxpayer? Not much..in my opinion. Coastal counties are banding together and are suing the State of North Carolina for discriminatory business practices. You are the new governor and you were elected. What do you personally intend to do about this matter...if anything? I intend to keep involved in this issue and its not going to go way. Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: North Carolina Insurance

Comment: Governor Purdue, I am writing in reference to the laws for insurance in the state of North Carolina. I would like to know why North Carolina does not allow for certain incentives on car insurance and any other insurance for that matter. Most car insurance companies these days offer incentives for being a safe driver, etc., however there are NO incentives to take advantage of in North Carolina, because the state government takes these away (ie accident forgiveness). More specifically, I just terminated an automobile policy on December 4th with Allstate and received a bill for about $70.00, even though I paid my previous bill on November the 10th and that covered me through the middle of December. At the most I should have been charged for 4 days worth of coverage in December. After an hour long phone call with 2 Allstate representatives to figure out where the $70 bill was coming from, it was discovered that the state of North Carolina requires 27% plus another fee on top of that of what my policy was. This is ludicrous. The state of North Carolina does not offer my insurance, so why do I owe them money for cancelling a policy. This fee plus not allowing for the incentives offered by insurance companies does not give drivers, home owners, etc., any bonus for being safe or trying to save money on monthly payments. But, I guess that is what we get for living the tax capital of the United States. Respectfully, Carrie J. Smith

Dear Sirs:

The letter below was sent hard copy to the CEO and COO of BCBSNC.  Unfortunately they do not publish email addresses.  I hope  you will see it as a viable way to have a meaningful impact on the spiraling health cost of this state and country.  It is not for everyone but if South Carolina and other private and government entities can encourage it, why are we in NC not advancing the reduction of health cost for your constituents.

Most Sincerely,

Grafton Withers

Dear Sirs:


I write to suggest that policies change at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. 

·       I need a hip replacement.  The cost in N.C. is +/- $20,000 depending on location/prosthesis. 

·       The same procedure can be had in Singapore, France, Thailand or India for less than half. 

·       I am ready to go to one of these locations and I have done my research on quality of care.

·       BCBSNC Customer Service responded that they would not entertain that option of traveling abroad to reduce procedure cost and that there was no one to whom I could write. 

BCBS of South Carolina not only offers, but encourages this option.  They gain by reducing their cost and provide encouragement by reducing or eliminating the deductable payment for the patient.  It is a financial win-win for BCBS of SC and the patient.  But more importantly, it provides a reduction in the overall health cost expenditure for the State’s residents allowing that money to go elsewhere.


So why do we in NC not encourage our companies to reduce overall health care cost?  There are thousands of procedures which are ‘one-off’ operations with minimal or no post-op needs.  Why should BCBS of North Carolina NOT offer this option? 

There is no learning curve—South Carolina offers it already and Aetna is offering the option to companies who in turn offer it to their employees.   Two articles below.

Let me be the guinea pig for this service.  I am ready to go now.


We can save money for the insurer; we can save for the insured; and, we can reduce the cost of health insurance procedures to help mitigate the spiraling inflation of healthcare.


Is no one interested in intervening to make this work?  With the cost of healthcare rising and the need to keep money in the pockets of families, how can this NOT be an effective way to help?


Sincerely,

Grafton Withers

Subject: Insurance Rate Increase

Comment: Dear Governor, We are originally from Greenville, NC. We are a military family. We were assigned to Camp Lejeune, NC in 2005; we bought a home in Onslow County. We bought our home according to our budget and were careful to buy our home outside FEMA Flood Zone AE. When we purchased the home our Mortgage to include escrow for insurance and taxes was a $1649.00. We have withstood the incremental insurance rate increases. Last week we received notice from our mortgage company that due to the recent rate hikes our new mortgage payment effective March 01, 2009 will be $2,152.25! We simply cannot afford our entire monthly mortgage payment to increase 30% in four years. Who can budget for a 30% increase like this? WHO Governor? This is beyond anything a reasonable person could foresee. Where are our representatives in this? I lived in Greenville NC during the FRAN & FLOYD hurricanes. I saw the massive flooding in the interior counties. My in-laws lived in Morehead city and received a few downed limbs the vast majority of claims I'm sure came from Greenville area and west. Why the money grab now? This will be the knife in the heart of homeowners here. Get ready Governor because this increase is going to be catastrophic. If you think foreclosures are bad now wait until these homeowners are sent their new insurance bill. It's easy for folks over in Raleigh and Charlotte to think people on the coast are a bunch of rich folks that are here on vacation in their million dollar homes but the vast majority of us are middle class families now living on strained budgets. Who is our advocate? I don’t mind paying my fair share but this is unbearable. This smells to high heaven insurance companies, the insurance commissioner, and back room deals. No public input or hearing. Yes this smells. As I'm writing I see the latest and by far largest money grab by the insurance companies arrived just after YOU WERW ELECTED GOVERNOR. Maybe I’m barking up the wrong tree? I think the die is cast. Regards Larry Collins

Subject: Health care policy

Comment: Dear Governor, I wrote the following to the CEO of our Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NC. We are always looking to find ways to reduce health care spending and our BCBSNC has no way to address what would be such a great cost reduction option. They have no department for this. South Carolina does and they encourage it. But we not. Please read the following: 3 February 2009 Robert J. Greczyn, Jr. President and Chief Executive Officer J. Bradley Wilson Chief Operating Officer Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina 5901 Chapel Hill Rd. Durham, NC 27707 Dear Sirs: I write to suggest that policies change at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. • I need a hip replacement. The cost in N.C. is +/- $20,000 depending on location/prosthesis. • The same procedure can be had in Singapore, France, Thailand or India for less than half. • I am ready to go to one of these locations and I have done my research on quality of care. • BCBSNC responded that they would not entertain that option of traveling abroad to reduce procedure cost. BCBS of South Carolina not only offers, but encourages this option. They gain by reducing their cost and provide encouragement by reducing or eliminating the deductable payment for the patient. It is a financial win-win for BCBS of SC and the patient. But more importantly, it provides a reduction in the overall health cost expenditure for the State’s residents allowing that money to go elsewhere. So why do we in NC not encourage our companies to reduce overall health care cost? There are thousands of procedures which are ‘one-off’ operations with minimal or no post-op needs. Why should BCBS of North Carolina NOT offer this option? There is no learning curve as South Carolina offers it already and Aetna is offering the option to companies who in turn offer it to their employees: Two Articles http://www.companionglobalhealthcare.com/news.aspx?article=35 http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/archive/1027medtourism.html page 3 Let me be the guinea pig for this service. I am ready to go now. We can save money for the insurer; we can save for the insured; and, we can reduce the cost of health insurance procedures to help mitigate the spiraling inflation of healthcare. Is no one interested in intervening to make this work? With the cost of health care rising and the need to keep money in the pockets of families, how can this NOT be an effective way to help?

Subject: New Auto Insurnace Law

Comment: My wife and I are retired senior citizens living on a fixed income. Today I received an automobile insurance rate increase from my insurance company 21st Century Insurance (Old name AIG). After talking with them I called the NC Insurance Commission office who informed me this was due to a new NC Department of Motor Vehicle Law (20-279.21 SEC, 3&4) which was passed into law. I’m told this new law, effective January 1, 2009, requires all auto insurance liability policies to include Uninsured Motorists (UM) coverage with limits equal to Bodily Injury (BI) Liability Limits. See attached letter from 21st Century Insurance. If this is true, I’m sure it could not have been the intent of those who passed the law. It is fine with me when the minimum for BI is increased from 25,000/50,000 to 30,000/60,000. It is also fine with me when previously declinable UM/UIM is now required and to be equal to the new 30,000/60,000 limit. But here is my problem: For over 20 years I have carried BI and UM/UIM in amounts way above the minimums then or now. I have always carried BI in the amount of 250,000/500,000 and UM/UIM in the amount of 100,000/300,000. Last year my cost for UM/UIM coverage was $90 per year. See attached statement 9-30-08 to 3-30-09. Now I’m told the new law requires me to increase UM/UIM to my BI amount of 250,000/500,000 which is increasing my cost per year to $274. That’s a $184 per year increase. See attached statement 3-30-09 to 9-30-09. Because I choose to carry increased limits for BI, I should not be required to carry increased limits for UM/UIM up to the same amount. Especially since what I have been carrying (UM/UIM in the amount of 100,000/300,000) is way above the new minimum requirement. For someone living on fixed income and for the other citizens of NC this is a huge increase that is totally unfair. Surely the NC senate did not intend for this to happen. Surely there is some mistake. Please help me. Sincerely, Steve Glasgow 704-362-0005 I could not make attachements.

Subject: Insurance Company Reporting Laws

Comment: I was in a hit and run accident on 2/9 and had to follow the driver with the 911 operator taking down all the turns we made until they stopped at their apartment several miles away only to find that the driver had no license. The Charlotte police officer filed 20090209072801 without putting in that it was a hit and run. I also called the persons insurance company Allstate Indemnity only to find that the policy was terminated on 8-16-08. I called the DMV and they still showed the policy # as valid for the registered owner. They were never notified by Allstate Indemnity that the policy was no longer in effect. Is there not a time limit on how long the insurance company has to report a lapse in coverage to the DMV? How can we stop the public from being taken by non insured motorists if the insurance company's who charge us for the uninsured/underinsured do not report them to the DMV so as to take away their tags and fine them. What can be done to make the insurance company’s take responsibility to curb the number of uninsured motorists in the state? Who can I talk to about this?

Comment: I'm not going to tell the Staff what my health problems are, but I need insurance of some type so I can see a doctor. My husband lost his job, but that doesn't mean we qualify for any assistance. I've applied for help, I've sat at the local health dept. without seeing any doctor. I've even sat at one of those clinics open to people without insurance. So, give me a few more numbers of places that I could possibly go to get medical help. At one point, back in 06' and 07', I had insurance, that I used to receive mental health treatment, but it was canceled, so I had to stop that treatment. Its a good thing nothing has happened that would send me back into a mental institution. God forbid, because I wouldn't be able to afford the medications. By the way, what is the cut off for medicaid? We live in Brunswick Co. and the workers at the dept. of social services will never give me an answer. There are 2 adults and 4 children in the home. Let me know if someone can help. Thanks

Subject: insurance

Comment: Governor Perdue, I live in Manteo, my home is not in the beach plan, but I have friends whose are. I traveled to Raleigh for the hearing last month; and was very interested that the gentleman representing the insurance commission seemed to be very mad at the people that live and work at the beach. He kept talking about the million dollar homes on the beach. But I can tell you that very few people who live here year round are in million dollar homes. So I was thinking how does Dare compare to Mecklenburg where they have had just as many hurricane hits as Dare in the last 10 years. I went to the national hurricane center website and the tax websites for the 2 counties. So this information is not confirmed or certified in any means but it makes you think. Below is the breakdown I found: SR Home Tax Value Mecklenburg Dare 250,001-500,000 33054 12979 500,001-1,000,000 8604 6282 1,000,001-1,500,000 1511 1401 1,500,001-2,000,000 430 548 2,000,001-2,500,000 135 127 2,500,001-3,000,000 57 31 These values are building and land because on Mecklenburg’s I couldn’t break out those values. Second, I have heard that the surplus not used is return to the companies each year. Maybe that should be extended to every 3 years. So that there will be more in reserves. Also I heard that when the surplus is disbursed it is not taxed by the IRS or NC Dept Of Revenue. If it is profit why is the state not getting there taxes out of it? Just some thoughts… Maybe we will see you again this summer at Lone Cedar. Buddy McCown

Address: 1324 Chadwick Shores Dr, Sneads Ferry, NC 28460

Email: caseystay@charter.net

Subject: Insurance Rate Increase

Comment: Dear Governor, We are originally from Greenville, NC. We are a military family. We were assigned to Camp Lejeune, NC in 2005; we bought a home in Onslow County. We bought our home according to our budget and were careful to buy our home outside FEMA Flood Zone AE. When we purchased the home our Mortgage to include escrow for insurance and taxes was a $1649.00. We have withstood the incremental insurance rate increases. Last week we received notice from our mortgage company that due to the recent rate hikes our new mortgage payment effective March 01, 2009 will be $2,152.25! We simply cannot afford our entire monthly mortgage payment to increase 30% in four years. Who can budget for a 30% increase like this? WHO Governor? This is beyond anything a reasonable person could foresee. Where are our representatives in this? I lived in Greenville NC during the FRAN & FLOYD hurricanes. I saw the massive flooding in the interior counties. My in-laws lived in Morehead city and received a few downed limbs the vast majority of claims I'm sure came from Greenville area and west. Why the money grab now? This will be the knife in the heart of homeowners here. Get ready Governor because this increase is going to be catastrophic. If you think foreclosures are bad now wait until these homeowners are sent their new insurance bill. It's easy for folks over in Raleigh and Charlotte to think people on the coast are a bunch of rich folks that are here on vacation in their million dollar homes but the vast majority of us are middle class families now living on strained budgets. Who is our advocate? I don’t mind paying my fair share but this is unbearable. This smells to high heaven insurance companies, the insurance commissioner, and back room deals. No public input or hearing. Yes this smells. As I'm writing I see the latest and by far largest money grab by the insurance companies arrived just after YOU WERW ELECTED GOVERNOR. Maybe I’m barking up the wrong tree? I think the die is cast. Regards Larry Collins

Subject: North Carolina Insurance

Comment: Governor Purdue, I am writing in reference to the laws for insurance in the state of North Carolina. I would like to know why North Carolina does not allow for certain incentives on car insurance and any other insurance for that matter. Most car insurance companies these days offer incentives for being a safe driver, etc., however there are NO incentives to take advantage of in North Carolina, because the state government takes these away (ie accident forgiveness). More specifically, I just terminated an automobile policy on December 4th with Allstate and received a bill for about $70.00, even though I paid my previous bill on November the 10th and that covered me through the middle of December. At the most I should have been charged for 4 days worth of coverage in December. After an hour long phone call with 2 Allstate representatives to figure out where the $70 bill was coming from, it was discovered that the state of North Carolina requires 27% plus another fee on top of that of what my policy was. This is ludicrous. The state of North Carolina does not offer my insurance, so why do I owe them money for cancelling a policy. This fee plus not allowing for the incentives offered by insurance companies does not give drivers, home owners, etc., any bonus for being safe or trying to save money on monthly payments. But, I guess that is what we get for living the tax capital of the United States. Respectfully, Carrie J. Smith

Subject: Insurance Company Reporting Laws

Comment: I was in a hit and run accident on 2/9 and had to follow the driver with the 911 operator taking down all the turns we made until they stopped at their apartment several miles away only to find that the driver had no license. The Charlotte police officer filed 20090209072801 without putting in that it was a hit and run. I also called the persons insurance company Allstate Indemnity only to find that the policy was terminated on 8-16-08. I called the DMV and they still showed the policy # as valid for the registered owner. They were never notified by Allstate Indemnity that the policy was no longer in effect. Is there not a time limit on how long the insurance company has to report a lapse in coverage to the DMV? How can we stop the public from being taken by non insured motorists if the insurance company's who charge us for the uninsured/underinsured do not report them to the DMV so as to take away their tags and fine them. What can be done to make the insurance company’s take responsibility to curb the number of uninsured motorists in the state? Who can I talk to about this?

Good afternoon,  To say I am outraged, is an understatement.  As a senior who is retired, (read cuts in Medicare and SS), I don't know where lawmakers think money grows.  Not on my tree, I can tell you.

I have been with the same insurance company for over 30 years, with one minor claim in the early 80s.  One auto accident in all that time, as well, by the way.  This makes no difference to these companies.

Why are those of us who live responsibly continue to be the ones hit to pay for everything?  Poor zoning requirements, codes and lax enforcement are never or rarely addressed by lawmakers.  Why are trailer parks allowed in 'danger prone' areas??????
Why are lawmakers so afraid to tackle 'for profit' insurance companies and make them responsible for those of us who take care and protect our investments????

I am furious.

Thank you for your time,
Kathleen
