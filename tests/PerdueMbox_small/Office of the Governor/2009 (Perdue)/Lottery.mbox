Thank you for your recent inquiry to the Governor’s Office regarding the North Carolina Education Lottery.  The Governor’s Office has asked that I respond.



100% of lottery net proceeds go to education programs.  The NC Legislature determines how the lottery funds will be spent.  Currently four programs receive funding:  More at Four, teachers to reduce class sizes in grades K-3, school construction, and college scholarships.  You can find detailed information on how much each county as received in these four programs on our web page:  <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/>www.nc-educationlottery.org.   Here is a link to the information:  <http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2008.pdf>http://www.nc-educationlottery.org/uploads/docs/Beneficiary%20Brochure%20fy2008.pdf.  



Since inception, we have transferred over $918 million to education programs in North Carolina.  Our contribution represents about four percent of the education budget for the state.  While we are extremely proud of our contribution, it does not take care of all the education needs in the state.  The current state budget gap is greater than four percent.   We are glad that we can help meet the needs.

Thank you for your inquiry to the Governor’s Office.  They have asked that I respond to you.



100% of the net proceeds of the NC Education Lottery go to education.  Since inception March 30, 2006, we have transferred close to $919 million and will be making another transfer in April.  The funds go to the four programs designated by the lottery act:  More at Four, class size reduction in grades K-3, school construction and college scholarships.  The only program that goes directly to school budgets is class size reduction.



The Department of Public Instruction’s total annual budget for FY08 from state appropriations was $7.7 billion.  NCEL proceeds accounted for four percent of that amount.



Here is the link for detailed information on how much each county has received in each of the four programs.
