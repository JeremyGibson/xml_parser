Comment: According to newsobserver.com, Gov. Perdue issued several executive orders and directives today. Will copies of the orders be put online by the governor's office? Gov. Easley provided this service for the public when he held the office, and I hope Gov. Perdue continues the tradition. Respectfully, Dennis Isenbarger My opinions may not be those of my agency.

My congratulations to Gov. Purdue and her staff after taking office a few weeks ago. I had hopes to attend the Inauguration but became ill and watched that great ceremony unfold on TV!

I just want to let you know the importance of having your complete contact information here in our office and suggest you provide a photo along with the information for our local newspapers. They are cooperative in providing a block section with photos & info for Governor, both U.S. Senators, Congressional Office, State Senator & State Representative….in other words, a free space to show all 6 together.  I get calls from constituents each week requesting info for all our elected officials and I make every effort to answer their requests and refer them to the right contact, so the local newspapers are excellent resources.

If your communications person will contact me, I will be happy to assist with any local press contacts if necessary to complete this service to the for the TriCounty area of Cherokee, Clay and Graham Counties.

Thank you.

Hello,



My name is Sally Smith and I am the weekend assignment editor here at WRAL-TV in Raleigh.  Thanks for sending us this information.



We also wanted to check in to see if Governor Perdue has a statement regarding the proposed national stimulus pkg and what it means for North Carolina.  In the Senate’s version of the package, there is a proposed $40 billion cut in federal aid to the states.  With North Carolina expecting funding for roads and Medicaid and also $9 million for general needs, what does the current version of the stimulus package mean for North Carolina specifically?  Feel free to send me an email or give me a call at the assignment desk.



Thanks for your time!

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Fighting for NC jobs









Fighting for North Carolina Jobs



Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.



Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”



New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.



Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.



On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission



Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.



Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.



“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

Subject: Request for Comment

Comment: Governor Perdue, I live in New Bern and work as the Community Relations Director for Onslow Carteret Behavioral Healthcare Services in Jacksonville. Over the last year I worked with Alice Underhill, William Wainwright, Jean Preston and Anne Bryan as well as others to advocate for leaders who have an understanding of the needs of our neighbors with mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse issues. Much of what is needed is communication and publicity. I have created an eNewsletter to share with community partners in an effort to publish information and resources for those with mental health needs. I would like to have "guest notes" to begin each edition and would like for you to be the first “guest”. It would make a great statement to our communities (military, tourist and natives) that you are committed to ensuring that people are able to access services needed (government funded, faith based or donation based). Often, people only need to know that there is hope and the possibility of support to get them through difficult times. Often, this is best accomplished by someone with your stature. Please let me know if you are interested or able to do this - just a short comment or a few sentences would make our first edition have a greater impact. I thank you for your time and look forward to seeing you outside of New Bern and in Raleigh working for all North Carolinians! Respectfully Submitted, Tanya Roberts, MSW

Comment: Good morning, I am Vickie Wilkins, local President for the Lee Association of Educators. Each year our local designs a tee shirt for the convention amd last year the quote was from Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue, and this year we said our quote would be from the Governor. In working with her staff last year the quote was "Without NCAE there would be no professional voice in the General Assembly for educators who work in our public schools." From her State of the State address we would like to use this quote, if it meets with her approval. "Education is the engine that propels North Carolina's future. It cannot and it will not be sacrificed." Governor Beverly Perdue If you could let us know if this is acceptable, we will be glad to have this printed on our shirts. Thanks for your assistance. Have a great weekend. Vickie Wilkins President Lee Association of Educators
