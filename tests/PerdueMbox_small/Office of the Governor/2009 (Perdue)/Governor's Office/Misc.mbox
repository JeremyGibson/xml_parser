Thank you for your time and assistance.

The funeral for radio pioneer William Hennessee "BIG BAD BILL" is at Lewis Chapel Freewill Baptist at Noon.



He actually started on the first station playing R&B music in Fayetteville (1964)
contrary to what the article writes, and retired in 2001.



For 37 years he was community active and significant in Fayetteville, 
for promoting education.

gov. easley i just want to first commend you and say that i think you are doing a wonderful job of focusing on the state of nc as a whole and also the way that you are pulling things together.
i have a favor to ask of you i know i'm just a small fry but i do want to be in politics. i have no formal training or schooling and i need to know what direction i need to go. i mean i have been told and i have also tested very highly in politics. i can strike up a conversation with anyone, i never back down from a debate. i research any and all subjects being debate to the point that person i am debating just gives up. i can keep a cool and calm demeanor about myself in times of intense conflict. i am the peace keeper of my family and several other people, i know how to calm down a situation and resolve the matter in a short time and if not i don't quit till i do. i feel that my qualities are more than enough. so with this i am simply asking you to point me in the right direction and if i am backed by you and your constituents i can promise you that i will not fail you and will not let you down. i have worked in all types of job backgrounds as you will see if you so choose to pull up my employment history. i have yet to find my place and i am simply tired of going to a place where i know i'm not going to make a difference. so please i am begging you to help me out.
for the past 6 almost 7 years that i have been married i have always been the bread winner and my wife has stayed at home. well now i have not one but two wonderful son's and i want them to see what a real man is supposed to do and i want them to look back after i am gone and say " my father was a great man he did wonderful things and accomplished" the recognition isn't what i am really after i'm after the principle of the fact that one man can do great things and can make a difference.
with that i do hope that my letter to you has somehow touched you and has made you take notice because i know that what you have done so far has made me sit up and notice.
Sincerely,
Ryan K. Black

Brynn, I thought this would be something that the Governor would want to
participate in.  They are asking for a short quote of a remembrance of Dr.
Rachel Darden Davis.  Dr. Davis' great-niece is doing this for the DAR.  Let
me know if I need to send this to anyone else.
A.

Dear Madame Governor-

Thank you for your attention.  My great Aunt, Dr. Rachel Darden Davis, is
Kinston's DAR Moseley Bright Chapter's first "Outstanding Women in American
History" honoree.

I would appreciate your perspective of Aunt Rachel's contributions.

Aunt Rachel's daughter Harriette Wilde recalled you pointing out to Buck
Wilde
the importance Aunt Rachel had pioneering the way for women in politics from
Eastern North Carolina. Following, I committed to contact you.

Recognizing your duties carry great weight and occupy your time, may I be so
fortunate to have some of your time in person or by phone to discuss the
aforementioned?

I thought you might enjoy reading the recitation I gave to introduce Aunt
Rachel
to the ladies of my DAR chapter last September for their consideration as
our
first "Outstanding Women in American History" honoree (attached). The vote
was
unanimous!

As I am limited to a 100 word submission for posting at National, I will
focus
on only three significant areas of contribution. Your help is appreciated.

Respectfully,
Ann Davis


About Outstanding Women in American History:

The emphasis of Women in American History is on the role of women, past and
present, in American history. Chapters are encouraged to select a notable
woman
from their state or community to honor. March is officially "Women's History
Month," so chapters may wish to use this occasion to acknowledge the
outstanding
contributions of the woman of their choice.

Women are chosen for this honor by taking into consideration contributions
or
differences made. The women should be, or have been, intellectual,
educational,
social, religious, political, scientific, or cultural innovators. The woman
or
women being honored may be DAR members, prospective DAR members, or
non-members,
living or deceased.

Each chapter honoring a woman is asked to prepare a 100-word report about
her,
with a photo, if available. A database of women honored for the year is
compiled
from these reports and published on the National DAR website.

Comment: Hi Bev, I'm one of your docents at the NC State Capitol Building. It is so nice to have a Governor that uses their office in the Capitol Bldg. Thanks for stopping to say Hello to my 4th grade group as we toured the State Capitol Bldg this week. They were thrilled. As a retired Engineer/Project Manager/Energy Conservation Specialist who now enjoys being a WCPSS Guest Teacher, GAL & active Volunteer, please let me know if I can help with anything.
