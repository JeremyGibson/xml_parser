First of all I don't really consider you a Governor - you just aren't bright enough.
Secondly - the economy is terrible - so you take a personal vacation - wow must be nice
to not really give a damn about North Carolinians who can't find a job -

Sincerely

Frank L Jones
Selma NC

P.S. You did about as much good on Capital Hill as you do here -
at least stay in the state and quit embarrassing us.

Fighting for North Carolina Jobs


Governor Perdue was one of four governors to participate in a panel at the U.S. House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Williamsburg, Va. on Friday.

Her message was heard loud and clear: “pass the stimulus package without delay, with as few restrictions as possible, and do not delay distribution of the funds.  We must put that money, and our people, to work now.”

New York Governor David Paterson, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Colorado Governor Bill Ritter also participated in the conference.

Governor Perdue continues to fight for North Carolina’s needs in Washington.  In January, she traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and then President-elect Obama’s Transition to discuss the federal stimulus package.  In December, she met with the 50 state governors and then President-elect Obama in Philadelphia.


On-Site Accountability at the Employment Security Commission


Friday afternoon Governor Perdue made an unannounced visit to the JobLink Career Center at the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh.  She spoke to employees, toured the facility and asked questions of the citizens who were there receiving services.

Gov. Perdue was specifically looking for indications that the Career Center was providing the types of services needed by today’s unemployed. She focused on the hours the Center is open, how many staff and partner agencies are available and what kinds of diverse services are provided, and whether the Center has been able to change to meet growing demand.

The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. Her first such visit was to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro two weeks ago.

“I heard the real stories behind the numbers – I met people who had lost jobs due to this troubled economy, of course, but I also saw so much more.  I met someone who holds a PhD but can’t find a job. I talked to job seekers who are former military and are looking for a career outside the armed forces. I saw a woman who had never held a job before but today is looking for a new path. These are real people we must work for, not just statistics. I want every single ESC office in North Carolina to be operating as efficiently and effectively as possible to best serve these citizens.”

WHY DO YOU INCOMPETENT CLODS AND CORRUPT THUGS EXPECT THE TAXPAYERS TO BAIL YOU OUT?  YOU GOT US IN THIS MESS, AND YOU WANT THE TAXPAYERS TO PAY THE PRICE FOR YOUR STUPIDITY?

ARE YOU TRYING TO DRIVE OUT ALL THE REMAINING BUSINESSES AND WORKERS WHO CREATE YOUR TAX REVENUE?  YOU WILL BE LEFT ONLY WITH THE HOLLYWEIRDS (WHO PROBABLY OFFSHORE THEIR ASSETS) AND THE WELFARE RECIPIENTS.

WISE UP, YOU IDIOTS!   HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO TAKE BEFORE THEY JUST MOVE TO NEVAADA?

Comment: Bev is so full of crap and now I am sorry I ever voted for her. She is doing exactly what that piece of ice in a suit, Mccrory was going to do - cut state jobs. Keep in mind, when you take away jobs, this affects people and families. I don't thyink any of you have even the slightest grasp on reality. The stimulus money was never going to be enough because all you people want to do is slash slash slash. What about slashing your damn jobs? Your pay? That wou;ld save money and bring you to a more relaistic dollar figure to attach to the worth of the work you all do - 0. Thanks the hell a lot.

Comment: I am disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed that I voted for you. Thankfully, I DIDN'T vote for Obama because I saw through him immediately. I had expected more of you, but you are just as inept as all the other Democrats currently in office. You really have no clue, do you? This stimulus is garbage and if you can't see that, then you are the most incompetent politician I have ever encountered. I am part of a growing movement to make sure Obama is stopped, with or without you. He intends to destroy this country by pushing us into socialism and you are helping him get there. You should be thrown out of office, too, if you aren't even smart enough to see what he is doing. Wake up. You obviously don't care at all about the people you are supposed to be SERVING. We DON'T work for you, YOU work for us and you'd better start acting like it.

Subject: Didn't take you long to steal from the honey pot, eh?

Comment: Wow. You Democrats and your baby-killing-fetish President don't take long, do you? I know, Bev Perdue, it's only $88 million dollars, right? Gosh, so what if you're taking money from our kids. I mean, it's not like anyone expected you to spend it on new schools anyway. If you went and did a crazy thing like that, why there would be no money left to run your "day-to-day operations". How in the world would your salary be paid? We surely can't let that happen. And my, my, my, what a difficult thing it is to balance a state budget. Average citizens like me barely balance our own budget. Oh, wait. I DO BALANCE MY OWN BUDGET!

Subject: Bev's Articulation

Comment: Been listening carefully to the new Governors comments in the media. I am very suprised that she is not more articulate and that some of her use of the English language is not proper. She really needs to think before she speaks and become more articulate in her speaking. I know this may sound petty, but I only mean to help her with her image and one that befits her office.

All, thought you should see this, though I don't think there's any way to find out who sent this.

I know there’s not much we can do with this email since all of his info is clearly fake, but his last statement makes me feel like he’s threatening the office. Thoughts?

Comment: I just heard that you are wanting to put 1 million dollars on US 220 construction. That's bull. We have enough roags that go nowhere as it is. Let alone construct more like we have now. Bring jobs and more people in first. Not pretty damn roads and expect foreigners to come in and drive by them. Use your head you left winged piece of politician. Or are you like our piece of s##t governor that just left. My guess is yes that you will use this money for youe own good. I think the world of Keith Chriscoe. He is a really good man. If you sorrupt him then I'll never forgive you or this piesce of crap administration. Keith can do his job if you will all let him do it his way.

Even though this woman is writing to the Governor about federal issues, given the proximity to Charlotte, I thought y'all should see this.

Subject: Economy

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Predue, I am so very upset about the lack of statesmenship in our federal and local governments. How can anyone in good conscience put in pork spending when we are in this situation? I am going to hold you personally accountable and will actively seek your removal from office if you don't actually veto and remain transparent while you are in office. This does appear to be the largest transfer of wealth in the nation and a more toward socialism and unless you take away all of our rights to vote privately there will be a back lash like has never been seen before in this country. The terrorist counted this people out due to their underestimating their love of freedom and rights, and that should be a warning to all politicians which will have a special place in hell soon. If you are unsure of my anger, let me spell it out to you. I am ANGRY AND I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY MORE! And should you mistakenly think that this is a partician feeling let me assure you that I would GLADLY RECALL ALL OF CONGRESS! We would do better picking our repesentatives out of a phonebook!! If you have any dreams of being reelected or even having supporters or even any personal wealth, you best paid heed to the stock market and the people. You are buying energy efficient drapes while our house is on fire and going off to the country club to congratulate each other. We now know how the French people feel when they call for "off with their heads" only it is not the wealthy to blame---it is this administration and this Congress!!! Don't just stand there----do something about this pork, socialism and transfer of wealth and jobs!! Or as God is my wittiness I will work like a woman scorned to put you and all of you out of office---I will have NOTHING TO LOOOSE!!!! Sincerely, Cindi Johnson
