I am writing on behalf of Joy Alford-Brand, candidate for appointment to the District Court bench in the 5th District. Joy is currently an Assistant District Attorney and she ran for a seat on thye District Court Bench during the 2008 election. Though she did not win, she did get 30,000 votes continuing to work and manage a great campaign. Joy is a great attorney with a lot of experience, character and integrity. She cares about the public and is passionate about the Democratic party, as am I. She will raise the standard for Judges in the 5th District and I am asking that you appoint her to the bench.



Thank You.

Governor Perdue,



Congratulations on your victory Bev! I recognize that there is plenty on your plate!



I hope you can change one thing with a proclamation by Executive Order that would affect everyone with a car. Yes..it's our blah passenger issue license plates.



Representatives Margaret Dickson, Lucy Allen and Becky Carney have sponsored 3 bills encouraging a "North Carolina License Plate Design Contest" with little success in 2003, 2005 and 2007 Legislative sessions. 



This bill for the 2007-2008 Session was H889. The bill passed with a huge majority vote in the NC House and never came up for a vote in the Senate.



<http://www.statesurge.com/bills/377090-h889-north-carolina>http://www.statesurge.com/bills/377090-h889-north-carolina

See the bill via link above and 25 Co-Sponsors.


Our state has so much to gain with a newly designed NC License Plate, and frankly nothing to lose!

It's smart to use the license plate for "marketing" our state, when NC vehicles are out of state. A new plate would make people feel proud to adorn their vehicles with an attractive license tag. Note the popularity of the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation plate - #1 in success. If that plate was less than half as attractive as it is, the demand would not be so strong. After all, who wants to attach an ugly license tag to their vehicle?

Make no mistake about those concerned that The First in Flight background will go away...not for thousands and thousands of SPECIAL ISSUES, that use them. 



Why even Orville and Wilbur Wright would be tired of this plate today.

IT IS THE LONGEST STANDARD ISSUE PLATE IN EXISTENCE SINCE 1982 !!
That's longer than any other state in the country - 27 years!!!!

As an observer of other states std. issue plates and life-long license tag collector, the recent addition of the RED lettered alpha-numeric characters to the NC LICENSE TAGS hand it top honors for " Most Unattractive State License Plate in the Nation." The Red inked embossed characters don't even match the backdrop RED! That decision, to go RED, was made by the DMV and not the NC Legislature.

PLEASE ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A STANDARD ISSUE LICENSE PLATE DESIGN CONTEST, WITH SUBMISSIONS TO YOUR OFFICE WEB SITE. POST THE CONTEST ON THE WEB SITE.  It should be required that all designs submitted be imprinted with the state tourism web site on the top or bottom. Design contest should be limited to 3 or 4 individuals spot colors on a white background. NC DMV Director or DMV Safety Director would need to approve the finalists for visibility and plate shop printing capabilities. Post the top 6 designs on your site and allow the vote to happen on your web site by the public via online voting.


We (the silent majority of registered motor vehicle owners) are counting on you!
