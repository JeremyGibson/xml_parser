Subject: Request for Infrastructure Project Listing



To Whom it May Concern:



In October a request was sent to our organization from the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) to submit a listing of potential and shovel ready regional infrastructure projects to be submitted to The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to examine the best way to direct regional infrastructure investments. 



It is my understanding that the Governor’s office submitted a similar list through the National Governors Association for the State of North Carolina.  



We would like to receive a copy of that listing. 



Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.

Dear Governor Easley,

First of all, I can't believe that immigration is not a subject in your drop down menu!?!

I can't believe what I read on the front page of the News and Observer today (7/30/08), "Library arrest roils county". We're deporting someone back to Mexico who hasnt' lived there since she was 3?!? She was a cheerleader, honor student, librarian and young mother? Quick, let's get her off the streets and back to Mexico, where she's practically never lived.



Does anyone pay attention to the business school reports that say NC and this country cannot afford to deport all illegal immigrants either in terms of man hours, court costs and biggest of all, loss of labor? When will the witch-hunt end!?! We are a nation of immigrants - mine came from Sweden and England, where did the rest of us come from?



Why don't we focus on something really harmful, like the 80,000 jobs lost to China from North Carolina, also reported in the same newspaper edition. This is what is really effecting my friends and family! Cisco employees are getting pulled off of projects that are being shipped over seas and Marxavi Angel Martinez is our biggest worry!?!



Sincerely,
Kirsten Gardner

Mr. Easley:

I am a Hispanic American born in Austin, Texas. I served in the United States Air Force and holder of Four Degrees. The Degrees include a MBA, BA, AAS, and USAF Diploma.

In the last couple of years the native North Carolinians complain with our illegal immigration problem. Though I am not happy paying for illegal immigrant’s children to go to school or healthcare, it is the right thing to do. But one thing must be noted, people in North Carolina associate immigration with Mexicans, which is completely wrong. My child is often stereotyped at school and letters are sent home, in Spanish, for me to read. Well I do not speak Spanish nor do I read Spanish. We must also note that “Mexicans” are often uneducated, hardworking, and take jobs that other people do not want.

With that said, the problem is with the H1 Visas in North Carolina. I have five Colleagues that are currently working in North Carolina and have H-1 Visas. They are all from Canada and make over 70,000 per year. One would argue that the reason for the H-1 Visa is due to the lack of skilled works in the United States. However, most of the H-1 Visas are for jobs not requiring a high level of difficulty such as: Computer Sales, Computer Technicians, and Computer support. With the current rate of employment, you cannot tell me that Americans can’t perform the same job.

I am a Civil Engineer and was currently laid-off. With the unemployment rate as high as it is, why doesn't North Carolina or the Federal Government revoke all of these Visas to leave the higher paying jobs for our own country?

Subject: health care reform summit in gso

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would be very interested in being at the health care reform summit in greensboro, that i saw in the news today. I have a special insight. I am a nurse, with a master's degree and 30 years experience. Due to some really bizarre situations, i found myself without health insurace for a long time. I have medicare now, through disability. I had to be my own advocate and take on a persona that is not my normal self, to fight, and I mean fight the system in numerous ways. I could give you a list of ridiculous things told to me during this time. I have been told that they don't usually have patients like me, where i have my internists office, which is sad. Anyway, my years as an advanced practice nurse in oncology and experience in healthcare as it has chaged during the years, was no match for what i have had to go through, just to get adequate basic healthcare, not to mention things like dental and other things. I am, of course just one of millions, unfortunatley. I just have a voice, with knowledge and experience behind it. Recently a dr. gave me a lecture on what an internist was, apparently not realizing my background. I called the director of the clinic to inform him and to tell that i had checked with medicare and for the dr. to call the provider line. And that is just a small example of what patients can go through. Anyway, i would very much like to be involved, from my professional experience and the very personal one. I had e-mailed the change. gov website, after it was up-i got an e-mail from john podesta saying to look at president elect-then obama's plan. If you could assist with this, i would be grateful. Is it to be an open meeting etc.? Thank you very much.

Dear Mr. Gilfus:



Thank you for your inquiry about the Military Advisory in Governor Perdue’s Office.  We very much appreciate your interest.



Governor Perdue has not named a new Military Advisor to date, but as you may be aware she is very supportive of the military and the military community, including their families and communities and the businesses and companies that work with DOD and the defense industry.  She has indicated her strong interest in creating jobs for North Carolinians in the aerospace and defense industries and continuing to make NC military friendly. 



At the present time I am assisting the Governor’s Office on military issues in general and would be happy to assist you.   



You may contact me by email or at the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you.
