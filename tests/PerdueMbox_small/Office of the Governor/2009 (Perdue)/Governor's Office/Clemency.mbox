Subject: Pardon

Comment: Dear Maddam Govenor, Since it is imposible to get a felony off one's record, I was wondering if I could get a pardon from you. It was something I did when I was young, 26 years ago. Now I have a family to support and with this over my head it is a terrible problem aquireing a good position. I learned my lesson a long time ago about taking the law in my own hands. Could you help me wipe my record clean for my family's sake and for justice's sake. Your friend, Harold Wayne Smith

Subject: clemency

Comment: I have written and send an application to governor M.Easley a few weeks ago requesting clemency for James Burnette #1000129.Who was charged with child molestation a few years ago. Never was there any evidence or DNA found or obtained in this case.The child in question has accused several other guys in a previous matter.Those guys, sad to say were convicted. In Mr. Burnettes case, there was no physical or any other evidence that this crime had ever occured. It was pretty much his word against her's.Mr. Burnette was assigned a court appointed attorney by the name of Sharon Kristoff. I have made several attempts to contact Mrs Kristoff just to be informed that she no longer practices law.The system has failed Mr Burnette. My plea with you is to please look into this matter for me.And not only myself but his children also. Who at the time of his conviction were send to a state foster home. It would mean a great deal to me and his kids to set an innocent man free. Sincerly Erika Duguay

Me and my wife own a small farm and have been married for 12 years.It was 17 years ago when a man came to my house and started a fight. I was 19 and he was in his 30s. I hit him with a roll of pennies in my hand.I was charged with a weapon. That has been looming over me for the last 17 years. I done my sentance. I have repaid society in full and yet I am still being punished. I have spoke to attorneys in this matter and it will cost me a great deal of money to fix. I don,t want gun permits or anything of that nature. I am starting R.C.C.C. this year for a 2 year Associate in Construction Management Technology. With the shape of the state right know I am trying to better myself so I can do better for my family. I am not asking for a hand out only alittle help. I have and will do my part and pay taxs and raise my family right, I only need the country that I care about to care about me and give me a opportunity.When i graduate from school I don't want something that happened 17 years ago to keep me from getting a job that would help me to raise my family better than I can now. Is there any options for a person in my position? I am being treated like I shot someone with a gun.Please help me Mrs. Perdue,I don;t have anyone else to turn to. I only want a chance.

Subject: wrongful conviction

Comment: Malicious prosecution of innocent person. This is still affecting my ability to get a job and I want it erased from my criminal record. FROM: David Crandall SUBJECT: Explanation of wrongful conviction of misdemeanor domestic violence because these were self-defense on my part and I was FALSELY ACCUSED and a victim of immigration fraud. The misdemeanor record for assault in 2002 was a horrendous miscarriage of justice and a misrepresentation of the facts in my case. Over seven years ago in 2001, I brought an immigrant fiancé from Uzbekistan to this country. I later found out she was from a family of Islamic militant extremists who are at war with the communist government there. She had a depression related mood disorder that caused her have temper tantrums and violent outbursts. She had juvenile tendencies; she hit me almost everyday. She was only 20 and I was 45 years old. One day she read one of my e-mails from an x-wife that said ‘I love you’ - she went “ballistic” - into a jealous rage and started yelling at me. I wanted to avoid a fight so I tried to leave, she blocked the door so I went to lye down on the couch and started laughing. She got on top of me, pinned me down and started hitting me about the head and face. I saw that she was really angry and out of control and trying to hurt me. I wanted to leave. I pushed her off of me and ran to the door but she blocked the door and took my keys. I struggled with her for my keys. About 30 minutes later after the situation had calmed, the police arrived. Instead of taking responsibility for her own actions she blamed me. She made up a story and framed me in order to avoid her own arrest so I was arrested. I was in a situation where I knew that if I accused her I would have to pay for her defense attorney if she is arrested. How could she blame herself when she was subject to arrest? I was not the one who was angry, she was. I was not the one who started the fight she was. I only tried to avoid it. I showed the police my wounds and told them she attacked me but they ignored my explanation. They arrested the wrong person because the laws are influenced by the radical feminist rights movement, there is no law against ‘assault on male’ but that is what this was. Neither one of us was seriously injured; I had bruises. My wife naturally and understandably lied to the police and court to avoid her own arrest and deportation and so she could stay in the country without staying married to me. She also had a financial motive for lying because it allowed her to pursue an amnesty application, get her legal fees covered by the government and the use of my house during our divorce. She had no proof and no witnesses. Only her (false) statements were used against me. Although I was completely innocent of any wrongdoing, I pleaded ‘no-contest’ because even subduing an attacking female is not allowed in their opinion. They don’t arrest women in these cases, they arrest men. I did not testify because my very incompetent public defender said that even subduing an attacking female could be construed as an assaulting a female in their opinion. My wife lied about what happened. I had a right to defend myself and my constitutional rights were grossly violated. There was no jail time. I served a little bit of probation and the case and our marriage was over. ____________________ I swear to god I was the victim of the assaults on my record. My personal safety was in jeopardy and I had the right to defend myself. I have never assaulted anyone in my entire life. I was the victim of malicious prosecution.

Subject: Kay Pope from Hickory needs YOUR attention to a very private matter



Gov Purdue, I have a very personal matter that can only be addressed by you. I hate to type this that anyone else that might see it, but I just called your office without being able to talk to you. In 1974 I was convicted on voluntary manslaughter of my husband. This had very extreme circumstances with it. I was on probation for 5 years, I had to raise 3 small children by myself after that. He beat me constantly and many other things. I have paid many, many times for what I did. I was out of my mind when it happened. Anyway, I am 60 years old now and disabled and it still comes up.  If anyone mentions felony, I cringe. I hate for anyone to bring it up, it seems like people could let it go by now. So many people know about it and have many times said they didn't blame for what I went through.  But someone still has to bring it up.  My children still have to hear it.



What I am begging from you is to pardon my records or what ever you have to do that I and my children can say that I don't have a criminal record. I beg of you, please. Some people can not leave that past in the past and it hurts me so much. My church wouldn't even let me work with the kids because of it. That is not very Christian to me and hurt me so when they told me. I have never remarried in all these years, he was so special to me, even with what I had to put up with.



I hope and pray that you can see how important this is to me. Being a woman, it is important that you understand. I tried with Easley and could not even get a reply.



I am sending this email to both this address and the other one hoping that no one else reads it and that one will go straight to you.



My phone number is 828-256-7471 if you are interested.  I am begging for you to help me . I need to get this erased.



Thank you Governor Perdue for your attention to this extremely sensitive and important matter.  I also voted for you. Congratulations!



Kay Pope

Comment: Dear Beverly, I was wondering if you could help a nice male, about 58 years old. We had some domestic violence a few years back, and they threw all these felony charges on my husband, who had never been in trouble with the law. His only love was flying, a small plane that he still has, and he cannot fly anymore with these felony charges on him. Could you please help a family in need? thanking you in advance, Ginger Moore RDH, Realtor/broker/loan officer. www.charlottelakewyliehomes.com

Subject: Changed My LIFE

Comment: Gov.Perdue,My name is Fred F Fitch and I lived in NC all my life until 8 years ago. I was raised by a Christan family but in my mid 20's I started hanging out with the wrong crowd and started using DRUGS. I owned a Building bussiness in Mooresboro, NC and did very well at this for 13yrs until the Drugs. I lost ererything I owned and went to jail for 6 months for Forging check of my boss at the time Mr. Jim White and this change my life forever.In 2000 I moved to Vermount and started a new life. I came to Vermount with 200.00 in my pocket and I have worked 7 days a week to get back to where I was in the good day of my life. I now have 10.5 ac. of land and a new home that My wife and I built with our on hands. I also have a great job as an Supervisor with Summit/Catamount,LLC and responible for the larger projects which are mostly State or Fed.funded or owned. The check that I forged gave me a Felony which has followed me always. I know what I did was WRONG and I can't the Forgey of a Check but as a role model for all my empolyees and the poeple that I work for it would be so helpful to have this Felony off of my record or at least drop to something other than a Felony. I can get ref. from the schools,Court Houses,Prisons,and citys where I have had secureity clearance by the owns rep. to verify that this is all true. It is a dream for me to be able to VOTE and be a member of the town I live in without the TITLE OF FELONY. Thank you, Fred F Fitch

Hi Bev Perdue,

I'll be quite frank with you Bev, when I was younger, 20, I was quite naive. I never thought that one mistake could endure the rest of my days. I was about 20 years old, and I was living with my mother, a registered nurse in Carolina Beach. The only thing I enjoyed was having fun and partying with my friends. I never thought about the future because I thought I could put it off until later. Well the sad thing is my mother kicked me out of her house. She set me up in a little apartment on Carolina Beach. Well one night I was trying to sleep so I could wake up to go look for a job so I could survive on my own when Tim Reid, Angela Reid, and Robert Pridgeon showed up unexpectedly and asked me to help them with a wicked plot. Tim wanted to kill his parents because he didn't want to go to prison for forging their checks. Although at the time I thought life hopeless I wasn't crazy enough to engage in the plot. I was young and naive at the time, but I did the right thing. I told them that I wouldn't help. As they were all leaving Bobby Pridgen took my car keys from the coffee table and said they were taking my car.

Sure enough I didn't want them taking my car, so I acted like I was going along with it. As a result, being the fool that I was, I ended up driving them to the Reids' house. Tim broke into the house once there, and I started trying to talk them out of it. In the end, I ran out of the house and hopped in my car after the dog started barking, and the others followed. To make a long story short, we were caught driving out of the Pine Valley housing section. As a result, I ended up believing a court appointed lawyer, and thinking that I should plead guilty to the crime. In court I stood up and said that I didn't intend to kill the Reids'. After having signed the plea bargain waiver for an old-law 10 year sentence, I served a 10 year sentence in about 4 years. To be honest one of the main factors in my signing it was the drive to get out of the county jail.

Sadly enough, in the current digital age I might as well have the word 'Felon' stamped to my head. Since I was released in 1998 I obtained a 2 year degree in computer engineering and a 4 year degree in information systems. I'm also doing pretty well considering that I'm monitoring the operations of a call center that houses about 400 Internet technicians. Most importantly, I'm staying out of trouble (the worst trouble I've been in was getting speeding and a seat belt tickets).

So I was wondering, there must be a way to fix this issue. Working with the court system seems impossible considering that all of the elements needed to withdraw a plea seem to be waived in the plea agreement. It seems to me that it should be due process for a judge to throw out a plea given that conspiracy to commit murder requires 'intent' of the defendent to commit the crime and that obviously I didn't really understand the nature of the offense that I was pleading to or I wouldn't have been saying I didn't intend to kill the Reids' while I was pleading guilty. Are there any laws that might soon give a felon a second chance? Especially those that haven't committed any crimes in years and it having been their first offense. This was my first and only felony offense.

Thank you kindly for listening to my story,

Tim

Comment: I am writing to request for an Pardon or Expungment of case # 051223-060 or CR 051223-060 and the cased occurred during the year of 2004. My attacker and I were charged with assault filed by the state of N.C. I stated during my trial that I was protecting myself from an individual and his sister. I do not know the individual but he stated “What are you looking at”? I did not hit the individual first, he pushed me first and I was in fear for my immediate safety, so I respond accordingly by after being pushed to the ground. I had punched the individual once so that he could get off of me. I did use any weapon and after he had pushed me. I stated to that individual that I do not want to fight. When the cops came he still ran towards me like a madman and the cops had to draw their weapon on the individual. I am trying to entering the military but this charge is hindering me. Please grant my request for an Pardon or Expungment so I can enlist with the military to provide me my family and serve my country. Thanks Jason Robinson

Subject: expungment or pardon

Comment: I would like to get my son's record expunged when he was 16. He is now 32 and about to graduate with a bachelors degree. He was in the military for five years and had accommadations while serving. He served in Afganistan and Iraq. Received Interior Communications 3rd Class Petty Officer Surface Warfare Medal. He currently is working for Sun Microsystems in Denver, Colorado. He was never in trouble before and has not even had a speeding ticket since. I don't know what to do exactly. He is truely a good person and it saddens me that he got with the wrong crowd at sixteen and went along but was not involved except for throwing a brick through a bicycle shop glass door. That he was guilty of. He was on intensive probation for a year and paid all restitution, even for the boys who did not pay. He took responsibility anyway. I am so very proud of the man he has become. His goal has always been to serve in the military and then the FBI or CIA. He has maintained a 4.0 GPA and has been on the Dean's list even while he was getting his associate's degree. In a few weeks he will be graduating with a bachelor's degree. He has been so remorseful for his actions and to this day it bothers him immensely. I want him to be able to fulfill his dreams or at least be afforded the chance to be considered. He is well respected at his current employer and with the people he is associated with. I blame myself for his misfortune, as I raised him being a single parent and with no child support monetary or otherwise. Being a nurse I had to work shift work and he was alone a lot. I want to help him achieve his goals in any possible way as I do feel an enormous amount of responsibility for his wrong doing when he was sixteen. He was the youngest of the boys and the peer pressure was very high. If I had of been there for him or his father had been in his life I don't think that two week period would have turned out as it did. I moved and he had to start a new school in his senior year and he was trying to fit in. I wish I had never moved and he had been allowed to remain in his high school for his last year. I made a promise to myself to try to rectify what I myself contributed to before I die. I am asking for guidance of any kind. I appreciate your consideration in this matter as it is so important. I don't think that a two week period of a sixteen year old boy's life should be a lifelong punishment. He never kept or sold or profited in anyway from his lack of judgment, but his punishment has been a lifelong one that I consider quite harsh considering it was for a broken door, which he paid for and there was nothing stolen that was not returned. Thank you for your consideration in helping me with this matter. He served his country in a time of war and honorably but cannot vote. Cordially; Beatrice Long 336-940-5615

Hello I am Bruce Alan McCarter born 06-28-1971. I use to live in SC. There
is
another Bruce McCarter in South Carolina that on 12-17-1989 was arrested in
Gaston County for resist/obstruct public officer.Everytime that I apply for
a
job this person shows up. They lived in Clover I lived in York connecting
towns.I went to the court house and the Sherrifs office and they both told
me
the record can not be attached to anyone (the quilty party) but it shows up
and
affects me when I am looking for a job. They called it poor bookkeeping back
then. It has no Date of birth,not social security number, no license number,
a
P. O. box for and address. It was paid and the person recieved prayer for
judgement. This is 20 years old and the court and/or the sherriffs office do
not
have a hard copy of the offense. This information is only usful in helping
to
prevent me from finding work even though I did not commit the offense.

Can you help me have this removed?

A man just wanting to work.

Bruce A. McCarter

Subject: Request for Seal, Expungement or Pardon

Comment: From: Jason Robinson DOB: May 31 1984 County of Conviction: Beaufort County Email: jrobinson1983@yahoo.com I am writing to request for a pardon of case # 051223-060 or CR 051223-060 and the cased occurred during the year of 2004. My attacker and I were charged with Misdemeanor assault on an individual filed by the state of N.C. I stated during my trial that I was protecting myself from an individuals and his sister. I do not know the individual but he stated “What are you looking at”? I did not hit the individual first, he pushed me first and I was in fear for my immediate safety, so I respond accordingly by after being pushed to the ground. I had punched the individual once so that he could get off of me. I did use any weapon and after he had pushed me. I stated to that individual that I do not want to fight. When the cops came he still ran towards me like a madman and the cops had to draw their weapon on the individual, please be advised that the arresting officer stated the same thing that I am stating to you and I did not have to pay any court fines, do any probation or do any jail time so I do know what happen for me to receive that Guilty Conviction because I had submitted a plead of not Guilty due to the simple fact that I was defending myself ,maybe I was convicted because I could not afford a lawyer but I am willing to pay any fees that it may cost to obtain my request of it becoming sealed , expunge, or pardon. I am trying to entering the military but this charge is hindering me. Please grant my request for a pardon so I can enlist with the military to provide me my family and serve my country because I was really defending myself that day like any one would have Thanks, Jason Robinson

Well, I think he's asking two questions - one about bankruptcy ruining his credit and two, about his youthful indiscretions.  I can check on number two but have no idea about number one.

Subject: Economc Pardon

Comment: Haveing been self employed for 20+ years in the construction trades, todays economic enviorment has me a little more than worried. Being a new father at 48 and unable to find a decent paying job leaves little hope for my families future. With so many people competeing for jobs, getting to the top of the list is impossible. It's not my age or the double hip replacements, it's because of a mistake I made 27 years ago. That's right, I'm a felon. Having learned my lesson back then and able to keep my nose clean all these years, I'm still being punished by perspective employers. Nobody wants to hire a convict. This brings to mind "The son suffers the sin's of the father". I have talked to an attorney here in G-boro about applying for a pardon and the cost for his services would amount to $30,000.00. A bit out of my price range. I have considered submitting the necessary documents my self, and this is truly time consuming. So my question is, what are the chances of recieveing a pardon? Will it be worth the effort? Or were they were right when they said it would be with me forever, even after death. I'm sorry for what I did. I had no idea that it would ultimately effect my famly. If you want to see my crimes to determine there severity my DOC# is 0092300. Again all I want to know is what are my chances for a better life. Sincerely, Thomas D. Crawley

My name is Laura Mackey and I am 22 years old. I have a very important question to ask. When I was 17, I pleaded guilty to stealing from the Monroe Mall Peebles. I had to pay court costs and fines. When my mother and I went to the office in the court house to pay the fines, we asked the lady there how long this would stay on my record. She told me that it would be waived after three years as long as I didn't get in any other type of trouble. Well, here it is 5 1/2 years later and this is still on my record. I have not been in any other type of trouble since then.... not even a parking ticket. As a matter of fact, I now own my own home, i am married and I have two beautiful kids. I am currently looking for a job....... and to my dismay.....cannot get a job due to my record. I don't have the money to afford a lawyer....I don't even have enough money to file the papers myself (which I have looked into). My husband is about to be laid off from his job, and Ive been a stay at home mother for some time now. If I don't get a job soon (Iam well qualified, just cannot because of my record) we are going to lose our house. We are already behind 2 payments. Is there anything you could please please do for me to get my record clean??

I could use a Governor's pardon in order to find work and support my family. I understand you probaly get these requests all the time, however i feel that if you can see your way tohelp me I can support my family again and not have to be supported by the State. Please consider my request you are more that welcome to check my record i do have a past Drug charge but that was in 1995 and have not been in any trouble until this happened. thank you James Wood

February 16,2009

To whom it may concern,

My name is Jennifer Miller and I am writing in reference to my past criminal history. Back in my earlier years I was the wild, drinking and drugging type of person. I guess you could say I was running with the wrong crowds. All of the things I did in my past I done to my family members as far as my record is concerned. I never went out with intentions to hurt other people I always seemed to just hurt the ones who really loved me. Well back to why I am writing to you. My family has forgiven me of my past and now I am trying to get my life on the right track. For the past 9 years now I have been sober of all drugs and alcohol, therefore I have become my true self again. As you will see if you take the time to look of my record all of my charges was back in my early years of life when I was only 17 to maybe 20. Back in 2001 I was tried in Florida also for a charge I have gotten from back in 2000 and I was incarcerated in the state penitentiary down there for 18 months. Unlike a lot of people who ends up there the percentage shows that most people end up going back again with in less than a year. As for me I went to opposite direction and it rehabilitated me into myself again. I have not been into any trouble since 2000 not even as far as a speeding ticket. I am trying to do my very best at being a pillar to my community but its hard when your past is always there in the way. I can not even get a job anywhere to support myself and my new 9 month daughter. What I am writing to you to ask is to help me become that pillar to the community I know I truly am. Help me find the resources to clear me name and record up so I can become the person I want to be. My poor mother is stretched to the limit trying to help me and now having to raise my daughter financially also. I know people have gotten things done about their record like having them expunged and sealed, but I don’t know how to go about trying to get this done. I have just now enrolled into college for the next semester season but you know it is hard to go back to school and get degree’s that you would not be able to even use because your background is still haunting you from your past. I don’t know if I am even writing to the right people or not, but I feel if not then you will atleast write back to let me know how to go about helping my situation. I want to thank you for your time in taking to read this letter and also Thank you in advance for helping me get through this.

Thanks so much

Jennifer Miller

Subject: Information on cleaning up my background

Comment: My name is Maurice Kemp and I want to get some information about what can be done to clean up my background in order to get a job. I recently moved to TX from NC with my family and I have had difficulty getting a job because of my criminal background. I would like information on how to get my record expunged if possible. If not, I need information on what I can do to help myself. I have had issues with incorrect negative information on my background stating that I have been in trouble as recent as 2005, but that is not true. These incorrect statements on my record have prevented me from obtaining several jobs with job placement agencies saying that it has not been long enough since I last got in trouble. I just need to know what I can do about my background since I have not been in trouble since 2000. I have a stable life with the exception of finding a job. I am trying to find a job to support my wife and kids since relocating with my wife's job to TX. If I am not eligible to get my record expunged, please advise me on what I can do to clean up my backround as much as possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Maurice Kemp

Subject: Issues with joining the United States Army

Comment: I am a twenty three year old male who graduated from Richlands High School in 2003. I have heard so many older gentlemen talk about being forced to join the armed services of this country because they had gotten into trouble with the law. The problem I am having is I want to join the United States Army and I am being told I can't because I have been in trouble with the law. I was convicted of felony burning of an unoccupied building in 2004, I was originally charged with three offenses but only convicted of one because of no prior trouble. Since that time I have not been in anymore trouble but because of my past I am being denied what some older guys have referred to as the best thing that could have happened to them, the United States Armed Service. I am asking you for your help in this matter, if there is any way you can help me I need it. At a time of economic distress anyone with a prior criminal record stands almost no chance of employment because the average "easy" to get jobs are being filled by workers with clean records. I thought the United States Military of all people would look at my future instead of harping on my past. If there is anything you can do or if you know which direction I should turn please contact me. I appreciate any and all efforts in this matter.

Comment: My husband wants to apply for U.S. citizenship, but he has a misdemeanor on his record. 19 years he was accused of shoplifting, and this is preventing him from achieving his long life dream of U.S. citizenship. He is a lawful permanent resident, has been for 25 years. Can you tell me the process he needs to follow to help him with this problem. I appreciate your help in advance.

Please omit my second request posted today. My son and I need to meet with the Governor to talk about The Great State of N.C. forgiving him for a boyish mistake so he can complete his degree from ECU(only lacks his student teaching).We have a book full of letters that speaks highly of my son.He is required to teach seven years in the state but needs your help to do so.His five year probation would be better served teaching.Yes he made a mistake but he will make us a great educator. Thank you The Crawfords
