Hi Zipper and Dosie,  We’re Hans and Toby.  Allow us two to be the first to congratulate you on being the “First Canines of North Carolina” .  We are both North Carolina natives and couldn’t imagine living anywhere else but this great state.  I’m sure the both of you are so proud of your new Governor who just happens to be your moma.  We both wish you the best and maybe just maybe someday we’ll be able to visit you.  Make us proud as the two of you have some mighty powerful shoes to fill.  Best wishes, Hans and Toby

Hi, Zipper and Dosie!



We are Jack and Rufus Perryman (Jack is the vertically challenged one). Our Mom and Dad are Van & Lu-Ann Perryman.

They watch the Dog Whisperer a lot. We don’t know why… 



Good luck as the First Dogs!

Dear Zippy and Dosie:

My dad showed me your web page, so I decided to send along a note and picture.

Congratulations on becoming our First Dogs! Our family is a big fan
of your mom's, and we are pleased she is leading our state.

Like y'all, I like to sleep and play. My dad says that I'm either in
fifth gear or neutral, nothing in between. I also like playing with
my ball and stuffed toys, and watching TV (Animal Planet and NASCAR).

I hope you're enjoying your new house. I bet there's a lot of
squirrels running around the yard for you to chase. Maybe one day I
can come over for a play date.

Take care.

Hi Dosie and Zipper!
I just wanted to be the first dog from Oakwood to welcome you to your new neighborhood!  My name is Oliver, and I live right around the corner from you guys.  I love going for long walks around the 'hood, and my owners often take me by your new house.  It looks like a great place to live with its big yard and all those great flowers to smell.  And I'll give you a little inside info.  If you want to escape and cause some trouble with me, I don't think you'll have much trouble sneaking under the fence at the northeast driveway.
If you're lucky, maybe the Governor will take you to work with her at the State House.  I'm not into politics or history, but the State House is one of my favorite places in the world.  One word: squirrels!  They are all over the place over there.  I'm going to catch one one of these days!
Anyways, I can't wait til you move in.  Shoot me an email if you ever want to set up a play date!
--Oliver

Attached is a photo of our rescued greyhound Candy, 12 years old.  A few months ago, after a brief bout with cancer, she passed away.  But she had a well-deserved and wonderful eight-year retirement in North Carolina from the tracks in Florida and Alabama.  She asked for little but was a great addition to our family.

Hi Zipper. My name is Teasia's Gidget Goes. but I answer to GiGi or "G". My adoptive parents "rescued" me from what should be called a puppy farm in Havelock, NC in 2005 when I was 18 months old and have lived in Raleigh most of the time since then. I sure glad I got away from the "farm." I know of only three other Tibetans in Raleigh, except for you and your Mom. I am spoiled rotten. All I have to do is bark a little and my Dad jumps up to take me out for a walk. Most of the time we just "stroll" around. I was trained to be a show dog, but I am too large for my breed. I like better being a house dog.
According to what I am told, Tibetans first came to the US in 1956. A British surgeon stationed in India was given a Tibetan after she had performed major surgery on the wife of a Tibetan tribesman. Early on, we were so highly prized that we were hidden from strangers and owners denied all knowledge of our existance.
I have included my picture sitting on my Dad's lap that was on our 2008 Christmas card. I hope you like your new home in Raleigh. I like mine.

Hi! I'm Molly and live with Ed and Regina Wyatt in Wilson.  I love to play with other dogs.  I'm full of energy!

Regina read in the paper that you wanted to see some pictures of other dogs in NC.  Mine is attached.

Enjoy your new home!  I'm glad we have first dogs in our state.

Dear Mama Dosie,



I’m sorry I haven’t written sooner.  But I am only 3, so most of the time I’d rather play than work on the computer.  And I have to wait for Jan or Ron to type for me because my paws are too big for the keys.



I’ve sent pictures of me and Gella for your website.  Remember Gella?  You met her when Jan and Uncle Bill came to your house for the first time, when I was just a baby.  We went to Colorado and climbed up mountains, while you were busy with politics last summer.  We have a lot of fun playing in the woods near the airport.



Now that you live in Raleigh, maybe you and Zipper could find a person to drive you to the dog park at Oakwood.  Me and Gella could meet you there, and show you the ropes.





Your puppy,



Monk

Hi Zipper,



My name is Spanky, and I live in Winnabow, NC with my Mommy & Daddy, my little sister, Darla, and Greycee, an African Grey parrot.  I am 3 years old, same as you.



My little sister and I are Yorkshire Terriers, and we only weigh about 3 lbs. each, but both of us sure know how to bark when someone comes to visit.  Like you, we are very good barkers and guard dogs.  Greycee knows each of our names, and when we bark, she gets annoyed and tells us to “Stop it!”



My Mommy took this picture of us just before Christmas, right after we got home from a trip to our groomer.  Our favorite thing to do is to go walking on the Riverfront Docks in Wilmington on a Sunday afternoon, and the beach here is a fun place, too – lots of seagulls to chase!



My sister is not quite 1 year old yet – she’s still in that “puppy” stage and a real pain !!! She teases me constantly, taking my toys away from me, chasing me and trying to wrestle; but I’m more laid back, and I’ve learned to just let her have her way.  My Daddy says I’m a “Mommy’s boy,” but he’s not one to talk, because I think he’s been spoiled by Mommy, too.



Spanky

My name is Eleanor Roosevelt-Luckey,an old Basset Hound from Iowa. I thought I should say hello to a couple of very cute First Dogs. I am a rescue dog who was lucky enough to find a new home and to me it is a mansion...not as  yours but a loving home just the same. My new momma loves to visit her friend in Raleigh and I would like to visit too.. Warm weather would be a welcome change from the snow and cold here in Iowa.   Dosie and Zipper enjoy being "First Dogs"....happy tails to both of you.

This is Gracey Lee and she is a rescue! We are very proud of her and the life we have been able to provide for her. Overcoming her fears after being abused was our biggest stepping stone with her but now she is loyal and loving.  She is just like our child.. (and sometimes she forgets she is a dog)
Best wishes.
