Subject: Assistance Please



Hello I am Bruce McCarter I am 38 years old. I was born 6-28-1971. I lived in South Carolina at the age of 18. Someone else lived in South Carolina that had the same name. They were arrested in Gaston County for Resist/obstrut public officer on 12-18-1989. This was not me but every I apply for a job this ends up in the way. I went to the court house and the sheriffs office and they say back then they had bad bookkeeping but this can not be taken off even though they can not attach it to anyone due to the lack of information address,ss#,or license number,DOB (bad bookkeeping). If they can not attach it to the person that it needs to be attached to and it is affecting me whom it should not be attached to. Can this name not just be removed?



It is about 20 years old and even the hard copy had been destroyed.



I know this is minor compared to all of the other things that you have to deal with.But it is real important to me and my family if I cannot get back to work we will lose our house.



Thank you for your assistance with this.





Bruce McCarter

Wanting to work....

Subject: Support the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As your constituent I write to you today to recognize the good work of the Justus-Warren Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force (JW-HDSPTF) and urge you to continue to support its' funding. The JW-HDSPTF, established in 1995, has funded programs that have helped to reduce death rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 1998, the first Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding became available for state Heart Disease and Prevention programs. Because of the activities of the Task Force and the availability of required state match, NC was one of the first states to be funded by the CDC. The JW-HDSPTF has helped to lay a successful foundation for healthier lives in North Carolina. I realize that our state is facing tough economic times and that you are facing tough decisions; but now is not the time to cut the programs that invest in the health of our citizens. Heart Disease remains the number one killer followed by stroke as the third leading causes of death in North Carolina. North Carolina needs to continue to take the steps to building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular disease and stroke by continuing to support the task force and its' funding needs. Thank you! Mark Sparks Sincerely, Mark Sparks 110 Mcginnis Drivee Grover, NC 28073

Comment: Governor, Please reconsider your stand that State employees should not pay a portion of their premium for healthcare in order to address the plan's short fall. It is only fair to the rest of us tax payers who must pay a portion of our premiums thourgh our private employers. It is not fair to pass the cost of this on to all tax payers who do not receive the benefits of the state employees health plan. Respectfully, Brent Monroe

Subject: TAXes

Comment: I am attaching a list of taxes we Americans pay. I cannot afford it any more. Do you really want a productive taxpayer to pay for all of this and now 'bailouts'. Also I am totally against 'bailouts' of any kind. Please do not approve any for North Carolina - it is embarrassing. I pay my bills I expect NC to do the same. Not one of these taxes listed below existed 100 years ago, and our nation was the most prosperous in the world. We had absolutely no national debt, had the largest middle class in the world, and Mom stayed home to raise the kids: 1. Accounts Receivable Tax 2. Building Permit Tax 3. CDL license Tax 4. Cigarette Tax 5. Corporate Income Tax 6. Dog License Tax 7. Excise Taxes 8. Federal Income Tax 9. Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) 10. Fishing License Tax 11. Food License Tax 12. Fuel Permit Tax 13. Gasoline At x (44.75 cents per gallon) 14. Gross Receipts Tax 15. Hunting License Tax 16. Inheritance Tax 17. Inventory Tax 18. IRS Interest Charges IRS Penalties (tax on top of tax) 19.

Dear Governor,



My name is Roc Sansotta. I have houses on Seagull Drive since 1988.  I have never asked the town or state or county for a penny to protect these houses.  My interest is to protect my investment.  When I bought these houses I was told the sandbags were for my protection.  As I signed to buy a Norâeaster hit and I lost 15 feet of driveway and didnât know what I had gotten myself into. Now the CRC and CAMA has ordered me to take the sandbags out !!!!



It has been a constant struggle keeping these houses rentable. These houses all bring in money to the state, county and town.  I wonder why I canât be left alone.  There are around 150 other homeowners in the same position.  Two people in the middle of my street have a $275,000 and a $300,000 mortgages and most others have large mortgages as well.  The only answer the town has given us is to give the town the houses and then pay $27,000 for them to be torn down.  I am sure neither the commissioners nor the Mayor would do this why would you ask the public to do this?



Flood insurance pays only if the house falls into the ocean.  My houses are fully booked for the entire season.  I reiterate that this is a lot of property tax and sales tax money that would go to the state, county and town.  Why would you not want to receive this money with the economy as it is now? 



Kaiser Chaffon was in this situation a few years ago with a $175,000 mortgage. He wasnât allowed to repair his sandbags and it wiped out his septic tank.  The town then condemned his house and it was not allowed to become operational.  The town tore it down and put a judgment against him for $27,000+.  Then the bank put a judgment against him for his $175,000 mortgage and put a hold on all of his checking accounts in North Carolina , New Jersey , Arizona , etc.  A lien was put against all his properties instate and out of state.  This effectively ruined him because he wasnât allowed to protect his property with sandbags



Bob Whetstine had his bags removed because of fear of a similar letter and it wiped out his septic tank. The town ordered his house to be torn down.  He succumbed to the request and then had to pay many thousands of dollars for it to be torn down.  He lost the house and the income from it.   His actions started a devastating chain of events on Nansemond Street .  After the first storm the house behind his became condemned as well as the house north of his house and the house behind that one.  The house north of that one was condemned as well.  Also the house south of his house and the house behind that house became condemned.  To this date all those houses are still condemned.



If  I pull my sandbags protecting my houses on Seagull Drive , the road will be washed out, the townâs water lines broken and the houses behind will become condemned after the first storm hits.  This will cause an out of control wildfire that will cost much needed revenue to the owners of these houses also to the state the county and the town. Let us keep and repair sandbags until we get beach nourishment.

<font size=2 face="Courier New"><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Dear Ms. Perdue,<br>
<br>
gov. bev perdue has asked her staff to find ways to balance the nc budget, and, on the table is cutting hiv prevention/adap and hiv case management services. this has devestating implications for our state.<o:p></o:p></span></font>
The above has been brought to my attention and I will fight this to the end! You are playing with life and death and this is outrageous! Cutting the budget is far from what needs to happen in fact if you would take time to make yourself aware of the increase of people contracting this virus you would increase the budget not cut it! I have pasted my story in hope this will open you eyes and lessen your prejudicial attitude. This virus can be spread to anyone there are no specific categories. There is however facts showing the virus is rapidly increasing in African American and Latino women.

This virus can be a death sentence and most definitely shortens the length of a person's life and the quality. You have no right to play God and cut off the help that is so deserving of all infected. Find another area where the budget can be cut and don't cut lives!!! I am Charlottean and come from extremely good family. This virus could happen to you, your children, grand children, brother, sister, aunt, uncle anyone. The decision you are considering is one you have no right to and should be left up to professionals such as doctors and persons knowing the complications of HIV/AIDS.







MY STORY by PATRICIA GARDNER



MY STORY by Patricia Gardner On December 26th, 2003, I was diagnosed with AIDS. This was only eleven days after my father passed away. I went to ER with double vision, they admitted me and after many tests they diagnosed me with AIDS and MS. My oldest brother shunned me and actually threw me out of his house at Christmas. I was eating "party mix" from the same bowl as my nieces (his daughters). He doesn't call or visit any longer. One of my cousins invited me to come visit anytime until she found out that I have AIDS. She has withdrawn the invitation and no longer contacts me. I met a girl that living in the same apartments, as myself, and she called 3 to 4 times a day. We went everywhere together, becoming great friends and spent every weekend at the pool together. Once I told her that I have AIDS she no longer calls ceased and she spends no time with me any longer 

The stigma surrounds my life daily.



I struggle through life just as everyone does each day and I have no tolerance for the stigma. I have also found that people don't want to be educated on this disease. People who have HIV/AIDS do suffer everyday and they don't need to suffer from the batter and degradation. I have been a very fortunate and have benefited from my disease. I am very blessed and I now have an advocacy that God gave me called The Red Hive (Real, Effective, Determination for HIVEducation). We are a branch of RAIN and are extremely fortunate to have their support. All of my advocates are infected and help persons infected with HIV/AIDS.



I have grown and learned so much about myself and life through this disease it's so amazing! So many others aren't as fortunate, however. They are suffering deeply from the disease and the stigma. I would also like to add that I am a white 46 year old heterosexual female. I have an Associates Degree in Business. I graduated from Myers Park High School. I grew up in Charlotte in the Southpark area. I was a model for Belk and other local stores and represented the Belk Teenboard for my school in 1977. I wonder what these prejudice persons must be thinking. Do you suppose they know someone like me becomes infected? Like I said previously, the stigma must end and acceptance must begin. Everyone needs to be educated on HIV/AIDS. This is the only way to protect themselves and others that they love. Thank you for caring and together we can make a difference.



I would also like to add the medications lessen the quality of life they cause a great deal of side effects, such as chemotherapy does. The nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are just a few. To live the medication is extremely imperative and one must continue to try to live in a manner as if they are not ill. It's difficult but does become a part of acceptance with the virus. I am committed to control this virus it will not kill me or mar my body any further. I am dedicated to helping others and myself, this will never end!



In the past few years my brother has gotten much closer and we are mending our relationship, however, I still feel a distance with him.

I'm not interested in empathy or pity, I don't care for any of this. I am interested in making you aware of the complications. Realize also we live on monies below poverty level and can no longer work. Any cold, flu, or virus I'm subjected to I catch from others and one of the most important things is I will never be able to own my own home again. How would you handle this if it were you and could you handle it? I do wonder!!!



Truly,

Patricia Gardner







I do hope this story which if factual will help you understand how important it is to continue to increase monies for all considerations concerning HIV/AIDS medical help and education!

Comment: There needs to be an accountability measure added into these programs.. In southest Raleigh alone I see women abusing the system each and everyday.. Selling there food cards to get there hair and nails done.. There needs to be a simple height and weight measurement table to quilify for the cards to help those who really need them.. I happens all the time in Southgate Plaza and at New Bern Rd at Krogers and Walmart. The women aren't shy to say they why they are selling the cards for nails or hair... or new clothes. While working Americans' suffer and have to watch each and every penny. Who can afford to get there hair done on a weekly basis or nails??? And what about Section8. The women in southeast Raleigh have there boyfriends and others living in these beautiful homes that have been lost by tax paying citizens!!! It is an outrage!!! It has happened in Crosslink Trace SubDivision.. We had to take the neighbor to court for gun shots and drug activity after the neighbor whom lived live before lost her home to foreclosure!!! Please call so I can show you the neighborhood petition and the police reports it is a discrace that such activity is happening here in Raleigh, the abuse of the Human and Social Service System!!!!! It is not just happening in my sub-division it is happening everywhere in Raleigh and I will make it public record even if I have to go to the news!! It has destroyed Heddingham sub-division as well look at the police reports from there as well!!!! Paula 919-747-9490

Subject: Internship Opportunity for Rhonda Hawkins

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue, My name is Rhonda Hawkins and I am currently unemployed. I am in need of doing an internship for approximately 4 months. I would like to see if the state of North Carolina would consider allowing me to do an internship with its accounting department.

Subject: Re: Roberts Road condition



Mrs. Bowen,

I hope you are doing well. I greatly appreciate your email. I am sorry that the road conditions are in such shambles not only in Newport, but throughout Carteret County and the rest of eastern North Carolina. I have spoken with several people in DOT and on the local transportation committee over the past couple of years. While many care, you are exactly right about some of the "big wigs" who could care less - and you're right, "NO", they're not listening - to you, or to me.

As you know, the economic and financial situations have caused money to be pulled away from many worthwhile projects. We can only hope and pray that monies earmarked for NC in the national economic stimulus plan (including transportation) will somehow benefit the citizens of North Carolina.

I am forwarding your email to the other county commissioners, DOT members, the governor's office, and local news media. Maybe we can get someone to pay some attention or at least realize that these are legitimate safety concerns.

Thank you very much for your continued input and your email. Let's work together to get the word out that we want to see some changes, not the "same ol' same ol'!"

Respectfully yours,

Commissioner Wade Nelms

If I can do anything to help the Roberts Road Mess, let me know. My family also lives on Roberts Road. Thanks for listening

To whom it may concern, I know that this is a long shot but I shooting for it anyway. My name is Wanda Cole and I am in desperate need of some assistance. I have tried my local government, I have tried legal aid, and I have made numerous phone calls and no one seems to understand or care. I am only trying to hold on to a roof over my head to prevent me from becoming homeless in the next couple of weeks.

This is my situation, I had been out of work two years prior to mid-November 2008. I have been in my home for twelve years this year. Unfortunately I have an issue on hand called foreclosure. My job is part time for now and I understand that mortgage holders want their money and I understand that. All I want these people to do is work with me and restructure my loan until I get a better job or another part-time job. All I want is for them to work with me and cut my payment in half until I can do better. They refuse to work me and could care less that I will be homeless. They would rather my home sit there empty with the satisfaction of knowing they put me out rather than work with me to help me hold on to it. I need some help from someone who cares about more than just having a title, but someone who cares about people. Please give me some type of response!!!!

Sincerely, Wanda Cole, (919) 731-4448 or (919) 344-2953

                                                                             (336) 835-4547     





February 25, 2009



To Whom It May Concern:

          First and foremost, I am against the building of the Fibrowatt Poultry Litter Incinerator and Power Plant being built next to Elkin, North Carolina. 

          Before I tell you why, let me introduce myself, I am Phillip Vestal and my dad owns 17 buildings that he rents to other business owners in downtown Elkin.  My self and my family take care of renting and renovating these building for the good of downtown Elkin.  We also own a family business, Kennedy Auto Supply, Inc., which has been in business for 54 years.  We really do no want to look out the window and see a 350 feet smoke stack as we and other downtown owners are looking to the start of each business day.  People come to downtown Elkin to shop and enjoy the Start you Heart walk that is provided for them, not to have their air polluted by a Poultry Litter Incinerator.  And what about the trucks hauling the litter and other waste, have you every driven behind one of those trucks, it stinks and leaves a trail every where it goes.  The covers on those trucks are not tight and that will just add more litter to our streets.    

          I have a vision for downtown Elkin and the surrounding areas; my dad actually started this vision with wanting an off ramp from Interstate 77 and Hwy 268 at the Yadkin River.  This would make it easier to get to downtown Elkin.  If we clean up around the Yadkin River, add some picnic tables, and then we could promote canoeing, rafting, tubing, and kayaking.   People come from hundreds of miles to enjoy the pleasures of a water way, where there is a picnic area and means to get in the water.  And a greenway would be a great incentive for people to come enjoy the river by walking or using the biking trial as they stroll along the Yadkin River.  Plus all this is good for the environment and better for our health. Due to America being one of the most over weight nations we would be doing something good for the cause and not causing more pollution at the same time.  Then if we add the fact that we have a train track, people love to ride trains and drive hundreds of miles to do so.  Lets also, not forget that Elkin is an old historic town, and we could change the looks of our building a little and make Elkin look like  a roaring 20s or 50s town.  Then people would be more interesting into coming to downtown Elkin to enjoy shopping, dining, or wine tasting then ride the train to Charles Sheltons Vineyard, for concerts on the lawn, dining and wine tasting.  Right across from the Vineyard is Freemans Saddle and Tack shop and in that area a western town could be built.  Then people could be picking up from Sheltons Vineyard with a stage coach, then take them to the western town.  Also, Charles Shelton would go ahead with his plans to build the large shopping center at the Dobson, Interstate 77 exit.  They could also, ride the train to Mt. Airy, to Mayberry or to the largest open-faced granite quarry.    The train also, could be used for seasonal purposes for instance; train ride with Santa, train ride with the Easter Bunny, used for romantic night-time rides for couples.  The list is endless.  And if we want to talk economy just think of the jobs this would create.   If we build this power plant, then none of this would be possible and to think only about 80 jobs will come from power plant and only half of those will be local.

          Also, has anyone seriously set down and thought about the pollution this would cause?  I have three grandchildren and I will worry about their safety and other childrens safety as they are playing at Elkin Park or at Chatham Park.   What will this do to their little bodies, especially their lungs?  The rise in cancer and our knowledge of cancer is phenomenal but can you prove this will not cause lung cancer as other pollutants do?

Another question, WHY would anyone put a power plant beside a river?  You are taking away something beautiful that can not be given back.  You are automatically depreciating this area and the tax value of our land.  If tax value goes down then the state and county will get less money.  Just another point to be consider before making a hasty decision about bringing the power plant to Elkin.    

I am going to leave you with one thought, Some people cant see past looking down to tie their shoes, but some people have to think ahead while they tie their shoes.

Thank you for your time and consideration in the manner.





                             Sincerely,

                                  Phillip Vestal

                                  Concerned Business Owner and Grandfather

Comment: I am very interested in knowing what your plan is for the North Carolina Prison System. I have a son in there who has never done anything to hurt anyone. Never killed, never stabbed, never shot anyone. The only person he has ever hurt has been himself. I am a psych nurse and am well aware that he has psychological problems. I have been told by therapist that he more than likely has Bipolar illness. I have friends who are therpaist who has already offered to take him on as a client when he comes home. I feel that with the economic the way it is our tax dollars should be doing more than paying for people in prison who could be doing something to contribute to society with help. Since we will be the ones paying for the help this is putting more money back into the economy. Please give this some thought. Thanks, Faye McGhee

Office of the Governor

The Honorable Bev Perdue

North Carolina State Capitol

One East Edenton Street

Raleigh, North Carolina



RE:  BHPS Hospitality Group request for meeting with Governor Perdue to discuss our plans to locate the International Science and Technology Innovation Center in Raleigh, North Carolina.



Dear Governor Perdue,



It is clear that the only way out of this recession is to put America back to work. BHPS Hospitality will be building a 350 room 4 star hotel and a separate 300,000 square foot, International Science and Technology Innovation Center just outside of downtown Raleigh. We have $85,000,000 in private investor funds committed to this project.

Attached please find the Innovate This brochure that shows some of the concepts for this project. The main areas of points of interest for your consideration include the following: 

* We will employ approximately 500 people during the construction of the Hotel and Innovation Center.
* Once opened we anticipate employing another 500 full time employees for the facilities.
* We will create a unique collaboration between Universities and Business from around the world to demonstrate new and future technology.
* The Innovation Center will provide a fun and educational environment that will allow the public hands on interaction with new and future technology.
* We will create an educational platform for the students of all ages.
* The Innovation Center will also have a number of entertainment features to actually keep the public involved and returning to the facility and actually learn something while they are there. I.e.; the Star Trek Experience, CSI, etc.
* We plan to create and build a media center much like the CNN facility in Atlanta.
* We will be creating a television show documenting the creation of the Hotel and Innovation Center featuring the most advanced environmentally friendly construction and building operation in the country.
* We will be creating a television series highlighting the new technology and the technology transfer within the universities and companies.


It is clear that a facility this unique will receive a great deal of national attention. North Carolina can be the leader in moving the nation forward out of the recession. We would like the opportunity to discuss the Hotel and Innovation Center with you and your staff.



Please call me and let me know if we might be able to meet with you and your staff. Thank you for your consideration.



Respectfully,

Subject: forced annexation

Comment: Last July, you said that you would consider giving landowners power to vote down involuntary annexations, but would wait for recommendations for a special state commission. The commission has voted to recommend a moratorium on forced annexations and a referendum for people under threat of such. Some majority leaders have already said that they will not allow either of these to come to the floor for a vote. And you know what happened last year with HB2367! So, are you going to help us, the people? Many of us voted for you partly because you did comment positively on a vote for the second-class disenfranchised people now being forcibly annexed!

Subject: I Support Comprehensive Smoke-free Legislation

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens? By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. We canât wait any longer; all those who live and visit North Carolina need to know they are safe in a smoke-free North Carolina. I urge you to support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. Sincerely, Brittan Williams 4207 Waterlyn Ct Greensboro, NC 27405-9757

Subject: No Child Left Behind Policy

Comment: Hello, I am a social work student at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. We are in class and the topic of children's success in school became a very large discussion. One of the students Louise Disharoon came up with a very good idea, "No Parent's Left Behind". It is in our children's best interest to have support within their environment. Teacher's are not the problem it is the children's natural support systems. If we could come up with a policy that would influence the problem in a positive manner. And I guess my question is what is your position on this matter and how can we help. I am a parent myself, I invest alot of my time in my children's education because I have learned the importance of education and the success that it brings. I feel that if we come together to encourage, educate, and promote providing education to these parents. Thanks for your time. Respectfully, Victoria S. Carter

Subject: Support Public Health - VOTE YES on HB 2/SB 205

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Every workplace - including restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and other public places should be smoke-free. Most people work eight-hour shifts - if thirty minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack - think about what eight hours can do! Smoke-free laws are simple, strong and fair. By supporting a strong law that protects all workers we provide an equal footing to all businesses and employees. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Smoke-free laws result in a healthier workforce, greater productivity, and healthcare costs savings. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts.

Comment: WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows: âThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the peopleâ; and WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States and no more; and WHEREAS, the scope of power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states; and WHEREAS, today, in 2009, the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government; and WHEREAS, many powers assumed by the federal government and federal mandates are directly in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has ruled in New York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992), that Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regulatory processes of the states; and WHEREAS, a number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the present administration and from Congress may further violate the Constitution of the United States; now, therefore, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, THE SENATE CONCURRING, that we hereby affirm North Carolina's sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States. We also demand the federal government to halt and reverse its practice of assuming powers and of imposing mandates upon the states for purposes not enumerated by the Constitution of the United States. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a committee of conference and correspondence be appointed by the Speaker of the House and of the Senate, which shall have as its charge to communicate the preceding resolution to the legislatures of the several states, to assure them that this State continues in the same esteem of their friendship and to call for a joint working group between the states to enumerate the abuses of authority by the federal government and to seek repeal of the assumption of powers and the imposed mandates. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of North Carolinaâs Congressional delegation.

Comment: I do not think you are aware that Medicaid is being abuse like Medicare by a few or maybe more. I know of a lady that lives in the same apt bldg that I do. She is on Medicare and medicaid. iIn one month she went to the hospital by calling fire and medics.She goes about every day sometimes twice a daytothe er. She makes the rounds of the hospitals. She goes for acid reflux.can not have a bm, or hust don,t feel good. They send her home and then she goes here and there. She does have a little heart problem so she says-this is not the excvuse she gives for going to er every day.The local medicade offce and the one in Raleigh has been contacted but they will not do anything. People that really help sometimes can not get it.It is people like that plus greedy CEOs and banks have got the country in the mess we are in. Something should be done about this.Medicade should be investegated more and stricter laws. To lash Medicare is not fair to senior citizens because of greedy people. I am on Medicare and also pay a monthly prieuman for insurance supplment. I am 78 yrs old and legally blind. I want the governer to seethis letter not just office help. I would like a reply that you received this. thanks peggy carr

Subject: State Employment Issue

Comment: TO: The Honorable Governor Purdue I realize that you are extremely busy, however, I feel that you would listen to my concern. I am a 25 year state employee with Winston Salem State University. Just recently I was laid off from a Progam manager position, however, I was not told that my position ended until the day that I was let go. I was called into a conference room by our director on Feb. 2 and told that my position was ended effective Jan. 30. I knew that there was possibility that it would end but it would have been nice to know in December when the effective date would be or at least in January. I also applied for a similar position on campus yet the position was given to the daughter of the dean who supervises the position. That too seems not to be fair because I have more experience and am not related to anyone within the department. Doesn't the state system frown on nepotism? Unfortunately one month before, my husband too was laid off from his job so we both are without employment. Our son is a sophomore at Winston Salem State University where we pay tuition out of pocket without any financial aid. I would have thought that as a career-status employee, I would have been treated just a little better. I have always been a very hard worker with to less than very good on all performance appraisals. Is there no recourse for me? I appreciate your hearing my concerns. Sherry Ramsey 2258 Willow Bend Drive Kerrnersville, NC 27284 336.725.4142 home 336.404.8803 cell

Subject: Support Public Health - VOTE YES on HB 2/SB 205

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent I urge you to support efforts to make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in NC. There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. As little as thirty minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. You can save our hearts by passing a strong, comprehensive smoke-free law. Please support HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Every workplace - including restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and other public places should be smoke-free. Most people work eight-hour shifts - if thirty minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack - think about what eight hours can do! Smoke-free laws are simple, strong and fair. By supporting a strong law that protects all workers we provide an equal footing to all businesses and employees. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Smoke-free laws result in a healthier workforce, greater productivity, and healthcare costs savings. Now is the time to protect public health by supporting HB 2/SB 205 and make all indoor worksites smoke-free in NC. When you are asked to vote - vote YES for smoke-free and save our hearts. Sincerely, Dawn Ratliff 16109 Circlegreen Dr Charlotte, NC 28273-6957

Subject: Didn't take you long to steal from the honey pot, eh?

Comment: Wow. You Democrats and your baby-killing-fetish President don't take long, do you? I know, Bev Perdue, it's only $88 million dollars, right? Gosh, so what if you're taking money from our kids. I mean, it's not like anyone expected you to spend it on new schools anyway. If you went and did a crazy thing like that, why there would be no money left to run your "day-to-day operations". How in the world would your salary be paid? We surely can't let that happen. And my, my, my, what a difficult thing it is to balance a state budget. Average citizens like me barely balance our own budget. Oh, wait. I DO BALANCE MY OWN BUDGET!

Subject: I Support Comprehensive Smoke-free Legislation

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens? By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. We canât wait any longer; all those who live and visit North Carolina need to know they are safe in a smoke-free North Carolina. I urge you to support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. Sincerely, Ashley Gray 113 S Wilmington St Raleigh, NC 27601-1443

Dear GOVERNING Subscriber:

<http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkw-kg0jrwc><http://www.governing.com/articles/0903cover.gif>
You're busy, so I'll get to the point. The senior state and local officials who subscribe to GOVERNING magazine don't have much time for messing around, especially when they are helping lead the way through the greatest fiscal challenge in a generation. The March issue has been redesigned cover-to-cover to provide dependable, relevant and deeply reported journalism in a format that will be easier to use and easier to read.

What's changed?

Following the opening column by longtime magazine editor Alan Ehrenhalt -- whose four decades of reporting and writing about government make his often-surprising <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkwDkg0jrwc>Assessments critical reading -- is a new Politics + Policy section. It includes campaign and election updates from across the country by GOVERNING.com <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxekg0jrwc>"Ballot Box" bloggers Alan Greenblatt and Josh Goodman, and expanded coverage of the issues that matter most, from city hall to the state legislatures, including:
<http://www.governing.com/articles/0903publisher2.gif> At Issue, monthly snapshots of top-agenda items in statehouses from coast to coast
 <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxikg0jrwc>Economic Engines, where columnists Alex Marshall and William Fulton look at transportation, corporate incentives and other initiatives aimed at fostering development and restarting the economy
 New departments devoted to two other policy priorities: <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxmkg0jrwc>health policy and <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxqkg0jrwc>"green government"

Politics + Policy also is home to some familiar features, such as Alan Greenblatt's monthly <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxukg0jrwc>Observer column and Managing Editor Chris Swope's <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkxykg0jrwc>Urban Notebook. And <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkx2kg0jrwc>Potomac Chronicle enters its third presidential administration in the hands of columnists Donald F. Kettl and GOVERNING's founding publisher and editor, Peter A. Harkness.

<http://www.governing.com/articles/0903publisher1.gif>
A new Problem Solver section in the back pages of the magazine offers insights and inspiration for the decision-makers whose jobs require them to lead the people, select the tools and find the money it takes to turn ideas into action. In this section:
 <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkx6kg0jrwc>Public Money columnists Girard Miller and John E. Petersen make sense of the dollars-and-cents issues that all senior government leaders face.
 <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkx-kg0jrwc>Smart Management columnists Katherine Barrett and Richard Greene (who also write GOVERNING.com's twice-monthly <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiw8bykg0jrwc>Management e-letter) tackle the challenges of leading and organizing public-sector staffs while also holding them accountable for their performance.
 Idea Center, a popular <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkyekg0jrwc>online feature by GOVERNING.com's Elizabeth Daigneau, debuts in print, showcasing innovative initiatives that will inspire creative thinking at all levels of government.
 <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkyikg0jrwc>Tech Talk columnist Ellen Perlman (author of a twice-monthly <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkymkg0jrwc>e-letter on the same subject) explains how emerging technologies are changing the way governments operate and do business with their constituents.

<http://www.governing.com/articles/0903publisher3.gif>
And we are presenting all of this on larger pages with higher-quality paper and greater emphasis on vivid photography from cover to cover.

Some things will not change. GOVERNING will continue to provide just as many in-depth monthly feature stories as we always have. And our commitment to fair and authoritative journalism is unwavering. This month's <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkyqkg0jrwc>cover story by Rob Gurwitt profiles New York Gov. David Paterson. We also have a two-piece <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkyukg0jrwc>special report on transportation; a story about a new way to <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwkyykg0jrwc>improve health care and reduce Medicaid costs; and an article that explains that the best way for governments to <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwky2kg0jrwc>shrink their technology-related energy use might be right at their fingertips (a topic we also plan to return to on our Web site in <http://gov-media.com/portal/wts/cemc3Qbd8caqsE7qiwky6kg0jrwc>a March 12 online forum on green computing).

The challenge of redesigning a magazine is similar to the challenges many of you are facing: changing what needs to be changed while preserving everything that works. As ever, we will depend on your feedback to be sure we're getting things right. The redesigned GOVERNING cover includes a new tag line: "Connecting America's Leaders." We value those connections as much as you do. You can contact me at <mailto:mstencel@governing.com>mstencel@governing.com.
