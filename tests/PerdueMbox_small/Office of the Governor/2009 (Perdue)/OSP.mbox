Dear Mr. Riley,



Thank you so much for your many years of service to our country.  Thanks also for your interest in employment with state government. Governor Perdue referred your letter to me and asked that I reply.

North Carolina state government is dedicated to serving our state’s citizens by hiring the most qualified candidate for each position. Each state agency and university handles its own recruitment and selection, as the individual agencies are the most capable of determining the candidate who best meets the needs of their programs. Most agencies use the state application (Form PD-107).  Others accept only equivalent on-line applications.  Details and specific contact information are provided with the individual vacancy notices on the job postings web site.

North Carolina State Government, through merit-based recruitment and selection processes, is committed to hiring qualified applicants.  From the information provided on the application, candidates are screened based on criteria specified in the vacancy announcement.  Hiring managers interview and make selection decisions from the most qualified group of applicants.  In appreciation for  your service to this State and this country during a period of war, and in recognition of the time and advantage lost toward the pursuit of a civilian career, as a veteran you are granted preference in employment.

I am sure that your qualifications and years of experience would serve North Carolina well and I urge you to apply for any positions that may be of interest to you. You will find a listing of available state jobs on our website at <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/jobs/.  Review the vacancy list frequently, as it is updated four times a day.

The state of North Carolina also has a temporary service agency, Temporary Solutions, <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/tempsolu/index.htm. Temporary positions often lead to permanent employment with the state. You may also wish to visit the website of the Employment Security Commission, <http://www.ncesc.com/>http://www.ncesc.com/, for jobs in the private sector. 

I wish you great success in your pursuit of a career with North Carolina state government and, again, thank you for your service to our country.

Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Email: gtriley7@aol.com

Subject: Employment Opportunities for NC Military Veterans

Comment: Dear Office of the Governor: First of all congratulations to Governor Bev Perdue for your great accomplishment and well organized, run and truthful campaign. You had my support through both your Lt. Governor elections and you additionally had my 110% support and prayers in your run for NC Governor. Well Done!!! On a another note and personal to me, I was born and raised in North Carolina at Cherry Point, NC while my Dad served in the US Marine Corps. I have served in the military 31 years out of my 55 years in this great Nation and State of ours. I am now a Military Retired Veteran who is unemployed after my retirement, went through a divorce and now may further have to suffer losing my home due to foreclosure due to my reduction in my income. I desperately need employment consideration in this case. My preference for a NC employment opportunity is to work with one of our State agencies. I have applied on numerous occasions with little or no avail or consideration for me as a military veteran. I would very much appreciate a member of your Staff to offer me some resolution and hope that our State and National Leaders care and are concerned not only for us as Citizens but for those like me who served our Country so proudly and selflessly in keeping the USA a safer place to live, work and raise our families. I would consider it an honor to be considered for subsequent employment in one of our State Agencies. Madam Governor, State Council and other NC Leaders, I request that you offer assistance in this much needed concern of mine. May God richly Bless you and your tenure as Governor of the Great State of North Carolina. Your time, cooperation and consideration are greatly appreciated. Sincerely, George T.

Dear Ms. Jordan,



Thank you so much for your timely response from the Governor's office regarding my recent comments and inquiry.  The service to God and my Country was a great honor and pleasure for me.



I must say that you have a wonderful talent in composing a letter and covering all the fine points of concern.   Madam Governor Perdue is definitely fortunate to have you and your credentials on her team for the challenges ahead.  During my military career my unit's slogan was "Mission First, Family Always".



Ma'am, would it behoove me to forward a copy of my resume to your office for review and subsequent opportunity consideration at a later date?  I have completed several online state applications and forwarded them to their perspective agency offices.  I hope in time those applications may be reviewed and I receive favorable contacts to schedule an interview(s).   I know that economic times are difficult all over our great state but, as I endure my current rough patch, I can only hope things will improve soon for all.    An employment opportunity at this juncture of my life would ensure that I would not have to experience a foreclosure and lose my home that I have resided in during the last 11 years.   I will continue however, to be proactive in my continuity of a job search and endeavor to persevere with a good positive attitude.



Ms. Jordan, may I echo my words of appreciation, and gratitude again for your timeliness in responding to my recent letter.  I feel confident in my quest and journey to obtain employment in the near future.   Please send my heartfelt gratitude and thanks to Gov. Perdue for referring my letter to you for appropriate action as you have so accurately achieved.  Again, my hat is off to the Office of the Governor and her fine Staff for their recent accomplishments and plans to make North Carolina "Clean and Green" again.



Thank you.



Respectfully,



George T. Riley

Dear Ms. Gunderson,



Thank you for taking the time to write about your concerns. Governor Bev Perdue shared your email and asked that I reply.



On January 13, Governor Perdue signed Executive Order No. 6 which directs that certain measures be taken to restrict state government spending.  The order directs that vacant positions shall not be filled unless approved by the department head as an extraordinary exception.  Agencies may make special exceptions for education and emergency situations; positions critical to law enforcement, public health, public safety and custody and/or care of persons for whom the state is responsible.



With regard to positions at New Hanover Correctional Center, the Department of Correction will make the determination as to whether exceptions will be made for vacant positions.



Thank you for your concern for our state’s inmates and for your service to the great state of North Carolina.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Comment: It's my understanding that if a state position is vacated for whatever reason, it will no longer be filled. How is this going to affect the state nursing industry in the NC prisons? We at New Hanover Correctional are critically short staffed as I type this query with another expected retirement come April of 2009. We simply cannot continue to function properly with limited and dwindling nurses. Please advise to the accuracy of the report I've heard. Thank you for your time and efforts.

Dear Mr. Lowman,



Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns about the hiring freeze. Governor Bev Perdue shared your email and asked that I reply.



Earlier this fiscal year, the Office of State budget and Management identified measures to restrict spending that minimized the impact on the delivery of services.  Unfortunately additional expenditure restrictions became necessary in January. The current hiring freeze, directed by Executive Order No. 6, was put into place based upon the predicted budget shortfall for FY 2008-2009.  At this time, it is not possible to determine when the freeze will be lifted.



I wish you the best of luck in your continued education.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I'm a state employee, and have been for just over 3 years. I am just wondering how long it might be before the hiring freezes will be lifted. I was approved for transfer, and due to the economic troubles that's been delayed. I am wanting to go back to school, but before I decide when to start I was kinda wanting to know when the hiring freeze might be lifted. Thank you.

Dear Mr. Sibbett,



Thank you for taking the time to write about your concerns. Governor Bev Perdue shared your email with me and asked that I reply.



Occasionally, adverse weather prohibits some employees from reporting to work but does not necessitate the closing of state offices or facilities. To establish procedures for such times, the State Personnel Commission has established an Adverse Weather policy.  You may read the entire policy and accompanying FAQs at <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/manuals/manual99/weather_etcpolicy.pdf>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/manuals/manual99/weather_etcpolicy.pdf.



It is the responsibility of all state employees to make a good faith effort to come to work during times of adverse weather. However those non-essential employees who anticipate problems in transportation are permitted and encouraged to take leave.  They may use vacation leave, use bonus leave, use compensatory leave, take leave without pay, or make up the time.  



In regards to teleworking, the State Personnel Commission has also adopted a teleworking policy.  You may access the policy at <http://www.osp.state.nc.us/manuals/manual99/telework.doc>http://www.osp.state.nc.us/manuals/manual99/telework.doc. Teleworking practices vary from agency to agency and the decision to allow a position or an employee to telework is wholly within management discretion depending on the business needs of the agency.



Should you have further questions, please let me know.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mr. Brian Sibbett

Address: po box 1105, Sanford, NC 27330

Email: ncbeachbound@windstream.net

Subject: questions about policy

Comment: I have a few questions. My wife works for the state in a non essential job. She drives to Raleigh daily. However, she either has to take a vacation day or make up work when we had the snow. Even though, the governor declared a state of emergency and ask for citizens to travel as little as possible. Why should my wife have to use a vacation day or make up the day when she nor I want her endangered on slick roads trying to get to work? Also, with technology moving ahead daily, why doesn't the state offer more telecommuting? Even if it's only a couple of days a week? At one point, I was considering applying with the state, but after seeing some of the things I've seen with my wife's position and what the state's policy's are, I'm convinced I'm better off in the private sector. Thank you in advance for responding to my questions and concerns.

While I am not exactly sure where to direct your kind offer, I think I have a good starting point.  I am told that Dr. Tom Griggs with the NC Highway Patrol is engaged in this line of work and that he would be a good initial contact for you. He can be reached at 919 662-4490.



Good luck with your pursuit and, once again, thank you for your most generous offer to assist state employees.

Dear Ms. McDonald,



Thank you for taking the time to write about the hiring freeze. Governor Bev Perdue shared your email and asked that I reply.



Earlier this fiscal year, the Office of State budget and Management identified measures to restrict spending that minimized the impact on the delivery of services.  Unfortunately additional expenditure restrictions became necessary in January. The current hiring freeze, directed by Executive Order No. 6, was put into place based upon the predicted budget shortfall for FY 2008-2009.  At this time, it is not possible to determine when the freeze will be lifted.



Thank you for your interest in employment with North Carolina state government.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

As for the sewage system being installed in your area, that is a county issue. You will need to contact your county officials about that.

Subject: Concerned Safety

Comment: I am curious as to when the freeze on hiring for corrections and other public safety positions will be lifted. Not only do I look forward to serving as correcvtions officer but I have friends and family currently serving as carrections officers and I am concerned about their safety. I know the facility at Tabor City in Columbus county is undermanned and these people deserve to have their safety put ahead of saving a few dollars now. I see so much money being wasted. They are putting in a long sewage line in this side of county that requires tearing up and repairing existing drives, fences, and lawns. I dont know anyone who even wants it here. That is small example of what I mean. Please use some commnon sense, the world is not nice place. We need police officers, highway patrolman, prison officials and gaurds. We need ambulances and safety response people. My septic tank works fine I dont need sewage lines that will need maiyaining orany other ridiculous waste of funds.

This week, Governor Perdue asked that all state agencies update their Reduction-In-Force (RIF) plans so that they are prepared should layoffs become necessary. Hopefully, layoffs will not occur but each agency is responsible for developing their own plan should a reduction-in-force be necessary.  As you noted in your letter, each agency has its own particular set of needs, therefore they prepare their own individual plans. Please contact the Department of Transportation directly to find out what your agency’s RIF plan is.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Visitor: Mr. Stephen Roberts

Address: P.O. Box 2202, Surf City, NC 28445

Email: stephenroberts_nc@yahoo.com

Subject: State Hiring Freeze

Comment: My wife and I have worked for the past eight years as licensed hearing instrument specialists until we both lost our jobs in October as a result of declined sales due to the economic situation. Before I became a licensed hearing instrument specialist I worked wtih the NC DOC as a Lead Officer. I spoke with Mr. George Kenworthy who is the administrator at the new Tabor City facility in early November, he informed me that he would hire me back with the DOC because I had been a good employee (he was my captain at Lumberton). He instructed me to get my application submitted and to call Raeford and schedule my testing so he could hire me but when I called I was informed that there was a departmental slow down so they were not sure when they would begin scheduling testing. I understand the dire situation our state and nation are in economically and I have continued seeking employment while anticipating being able to go back to work with the DOC. However, do you have any idea how long this hiring freeze will be in effect or can you advise me of what steps I can take? I don't mean to seem inpatient, I simply have a strong desire to regain some sense of stability in my life. Regards, Stephen Roberts

Mr. Matthews,



At this time, we are unsure exactly how the hiring freeze will affect various jobs.  The hiring process for the SBI is very lengthy so you should allow about 3-4 months before hearing anything either during the interview process or at the end of the process by letter.



If you wish to contact our office direct, our phone number is 919-716-6490.

With regard to support positions in the public school system and the university system, those agencies will carefully consider the health and safety of our citizens, their agencies’ missions, and their business needs, and will make the determination as to whether exceptions will be made for vacant positions at their respective institutions. 



Thank you for your interest in employment with the State of North Carolina.  I wish you success in your pursuit of a position.

Subject: Hiring Freezes

Comment: When might or what does determine the lift of the hiring freeze for state agencies? Specificly for support positions in public schools or universities. Or, are the freezes driven by the cut in the educational budget? I would apprciate some feed back as to where I could find reliable information.

Dear Ms. Brown,



Thank you for taking the time to write about your concerns regarding the hiring freeze. Governor Bev Perdue shared your email with me and asked that I reply.



On January 13, Governor Perdue signed Executive Order No. 6 which directs that certain measures be taken to restrict state government spending.  The order directs that vacant positions shall not be filled unless approved by the department head as an extraordinary exception.  Agencies may make special exceptions for education and emergency situations; positions critical to law enforcement, public health, public safety and custody and/or care of persons for whom the state is responsible.



As information about the budget crisis continues to be revealed, it is impossible to predict when the hiring freeze might be lifted. With regard to positions in the community colleges system, that agency and its individual institutions will carefully consider the health and safety of our citizens, the agency’s mission, and business needs, and will make the determination as to whether exceptions will be made for vacant positions at their respective institutions.  If you are interested in a particular community college, I suggest you contact them directly.



Thank you for your interest in employment with the State of North Carolina.  I wish you success in your pursuit of a position.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Visitor: Mrs. Lindsey Smith

Address: Van Hecke-Wettach Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3380

Email: guice@email.unc.edu

Subject: Hiring Freeze

Comment: I work in the Career Services Office at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. We've had many students ask about the current state hiring freeze. Can you please tell me 1) Whether the state is still under a hiring freeze; 2) If there is a set date that the hiring freeze will be lifted; 3) What it means to be in a hiring freeze (i.e. - does this mean that a position, once it becomes vacant, must be left vacant for a certain period of time? If so, how long is that period of time?); 4) Are there exceptions to the hiring freeze? Any information that you could provide or could point me to would be helpful in counseling our students. I was unable to find an answer on the Governor's website and am not sure where else I should be looking. Thanks in advance for your help! Lindsey Smith

Dear Lt. Bryant,



Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns regarding dual employment. Governor Perdue shared your email with me and asked that I respond.



First, and most importantly, let me assure you that the Office of State Personnel wants to be attentive to your issues and provide assistance.



The answers to your questions, to a great extent, depend upon whether your position at DENR and your role in your “part-time employment” are subject or not subject to the overtime provisions of federal FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act).  Therefore, Mr. Larry Vales of our office will contact the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ Human Resources Office on your behalf and will work with them to review your specific situation.   He will ask DENR human resources to contact you directly to assure you receive a full response to your concerns.



It is also possible that during these difficult economic times, agencies providing dual employment opportunities to state employees may not be able to continue such arrangements.



The concerns you have expressed are not related to last year’s implementation of the BEACON HR/Payroll system, other than the system does provide identification of some pay issues because of its integrated structure.  The federal law (FLSA) is the determinant in what hours constitute overtime and how they are to be legally compensated.  Therefore, an employee cannot “sign a waiver” agreeing not to receive overtime if FLSA regulations require the employee be compensated.



In closing, we want to emphasize that we understand your concerns and will see that they are addressed.



Sincerely,

Margaret Jordan

Address: 7602 Pontchartrain Rd., Wilmington, NC 28412

Subject: Beacon Payroll System

Comment: Dear Honorable Purdue, I wanted to share that when the Beacon Payroll system was put in place, I, a worker for the state for over 25 years and a dual state employee since July 1, 1999, has been made to stop working my part-time employment losing approximately $12000 of income per year and the state losing the taxes that would be paid on this. This system has affected many dual employees. Beacon went live for our departments April 1, 2008 and the Office of State Personnel has still not decided if they need to pay us for 2 years of retro overtime pay of which they say they do for any hours combined over 40 between the two jobs. I believe the state should allow employees to work dual if they are willing to sign a waiver exempting them of overtime pay; however, the OSP can't seem to figure out how to account for this in the Beacon system. If there is anything the Governor's office can do to encourage the OSP and Beacon to resolve these issues and pay those who have worked hard and anticipating dual overtime pay, please do so. The employees who have worked for the state as dual would greatly appreciate any assistance as this has gone on now for over nine months with very little encouragement that they are close to resolving. Sincerely, Lt. Terry Bryant NC State Fairgrounds and Special Events Coordinator NC Aquarium at Fort Fisher
