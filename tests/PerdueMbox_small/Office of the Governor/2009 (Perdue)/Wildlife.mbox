Subject: NC Wildlife Resource Officers

Comment: I'd like to know what the annual budget is for this dept. These law enforcement officers have to be costing 2.5 to 3 times what the average law enforcement officer costs the state. Full size SUV and Boat all burning massive amounts of fuel on top of the initial cost. The County Sheriff is patrolling every county, by boat, already. On the coast you have the Local County and Coast Guard. This is a duplication and triplication of service. Please provide me with some budget numbers. I'd also like to know the cost of each SUV and Boat.



Dear Mr. Weaver,



Thank you for your recent inquiry to Governor Beverly Perdue about the annual budget for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission Enforcement Division.  We have been asked to respond on behalf of the Office of the Governor.



Under N.C. General Statutes 75A-17 and 113-136, enforcement authority and jurisdiction  for hunting, inland fishing, and recreational boating have been granted to the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission.  The 210 Wildlife Enforcement Officers stationed across the state enforce hunting, trapping, fishing and boating regulations on all public and private lands, all inland waters except for private ponds, and up to three miles into the Atlantic Ocean. 



The annual  total operating budget for the Wildlife Resources Commission's Enforcement Division is $22,209,076.  Officers are assigned a variety of watercraft for patrolling inland and coastal waters.  Kayaks cost approximately $500.00, while the larger seaworthy vessels used in coastal areas cost approximately $53,000.  A majority of the purchase and operating costs of the boats are offset by a federal grant since the the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission is the sole state agency responsible for enforcing recreational boating regulations. The responsibility  includes investigating and reporting all recreational boating accidents to the U.S. Coast Guard. 



Officers' vehicles are leased from the Department of Administration's Motor Fleet Management Division, at a cost of $.54 to $.58 cents per mile.  Boats and vehicles are used for work with a variety of inland fishing and hunting activities in addition to their use in maintaining safety and compliance with boating laws on the waters of the state.



Again, thank you for your inquiry.



Sincerely,



Betsy Foard
