>> Dear Governor Easley:

I will have to send this email to you in two installments due to the amount of documentation attached.

I have contacted you numerous times about the conduct of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and have no response from you regarding this issue. I have spoken with someone at the citizen's division and they have continually told me to go through North Carolina DSS, but North DSS continues to ignore my complaint and lied to the Regional office in Atlanta, stating that they had spoken with us, Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence and stated in a written report that there were no policy violations. This statement by them is untrue. They never spoke with us, nor the Woods, nor did they ever view our evidence.

Furthermore, If there are no policy violations, what is that forged document? Why is there a risk assessment in the file dated October 11, 2006 when at that time, the Social Worker had never even met my husband, nor been to our home? Why is the social worker now charged with Felony Obstruction of Justice and awaiting trial? There were numerous policy and law violations which occurred in our case and they tried to cover them up by forging and falsifying documents. They came after us, because we complained about these violations. I believe Donnie Bumgarner, the director of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and Mary Henderson CPS supervisor knew that Allison Baker was forging and falsifying documents and that they may have even told her to. I cannot prove that, but statements made to me in recorded phone calls with these individuals leads me to believe that this is the truth.

I understand that you are at the end of your time as the Governor of this state. But before you go, if you could please look at my complaint against the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and do something about their illegal and unethical behavior it could make a difference in not only our lives, but the lives of the children who fall under their protection.

I have contact Benton Dempsey on this matter many times and have never received a response from him. To ignore my complaint does not make it go away, it just furthers the need for an investigation into this manner and their behavior. I have started posting my story publicly with the names included and it is my goal, that this story be known.

Sir, we are wanting our names cleared, they substantiated against us for the sole purpose of discrediting our complaints against them, we did nothing wrong. The substantiation against does not meet any criteria for abuse or neglect and it should be removed. We would also like a written apology from this department as well as a full investigation into their cases and practices, because ours are not the only complaints. The department of Social Services should be held to a higher standard and when they commit policy violations and blatantly break the law they should be held accountable for it. Children's lives depend on their ability to follow these policies and the law. They cannot be allowed to abuse their power in this manner. It is not right.

I have again attached my full complaint and some of the evidence that I have against them to this e-mail. I appreciate your prompt attention in this matter.


Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

>>  

>> DSS's behavior in this matter is deplorable and cannot be allowed to continue.  You are in a position to do something about it.  Children are dying because of DSS negligence in these matters.  They are breaking the law, violating welfare policy, removing children who shouldn't be removed and leaving children that should.  This system is broken and must be repaired.

>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>> 
>> My husbands actual signature
>> 
>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>> TEETH
>> 
>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>> 
>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>> 
>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>> 
>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>> 
>> 
>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>> 
>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>> 
>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?
>> 
>> COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.
>> 
>> Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.
>> 
>> My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>> 
>> Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.
>> 
>> RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1
>> 
>> This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.
>> 
>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2
>> 
>> If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.
>>  
SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.
>> 
>> 
>> ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4
>> 
>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.  But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Dear Mr. Benton:

I have sent you several e-mails and have yet to receive a response from you.  It is my understanding that as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service and according to General Statute 108A-74 you owe a duty to look into my complaint and fix the problem. 

I am asking you to conduct an investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of our report of child abuse, the falsified and forged documents, the vindictive and unethical manner in which they treated us during the course of their investigation and  the decision made against us.  I will state for the record that they maliciously came after us to discredit our complaints against them and did not begin investigating us until after we complained to North Carolina DSS in Raleigh, specifically Phyllis Fulton on October 23, 2006.

By requesting an investigation, I mean go look at the file, speak to us and our witnesses, view our evidence, speak to Detective Chris Handy at the Wilkesboro Police Department, who handled the investigation into the forged documents, speak with the DA who is taking this very seriously and prosecuting Mrs. Baker. I know it was stated to AFC and specifically Ruth Walker that North Carolina Department of Social Services conducted an investigation into our complaint and no policy violations were found, but that is a lie.  North Carolina Department of Social Services also stated that had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence, that is also a lie.  If there were no policy violations then why is Allison Baker being tried by the Wilkes County DA for Felony Obstruction of Justice for forging documents in this investigation.  If that isn't a policy violation then I don't know what is.  By ignoring our complaint and failing to rectify this situation you are, as the Principle of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, just as guilty of wrong doing as they are.

Furthermore, the whole case decision, mental health evaluation, everything in this case is based on lies, falsified documents or forgeries.  Allison Baker also falsified the Risk Assessment dated 10/11/06, the Family Strengths and Needs Assessment dated 10/11/06, how can you fill out these forms when you have never met the parent?  Allison Baker is the person who spoke with the psychologist who performed the mental health evaluation and the record that he received to do his investigation with, contained these falsified and forged documents. 

Everything in this case is a lie, fabrication, or forgery from the safety assessment dated 8/17/06 which also has a forgery of David's signature, to the letter to Judge Byrd Written by Linda Brooks when this case was closed in May.  We always worked with DSS even when we felt they were maliciously prosecuting us, behaving unethically, and forging documents and lying.  I have attached our full complaint to this e-mail.  I have attached most of the documentation that I have to this email, if you read it will you realize that my complaints are true and that the unethical and illegal behavior that occurred in this case must be rectified.  The forged signature and the real signature is also attached, you compare them and then tell me that there were no policy violations.  It is my contention that not only did Allison Baker forge David's signature, but Mary Henderson was aware of it as was Donnie Bumgarner.  I believe they may have even told her to do it.  My reason behind this is because of phone conversations I had with both of them. 

Your web page states:

"Mission and Philosophy

The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services is to provide efficient services that enhance the quality of life of North Carolina individuals and families so that they have opportunities for healthier and safer lives resulting ultimately in the achievement of economic and personal independence.
The department is devoted to <http://www.ncdhhs.gov/cstf/>quality customer service. We welcome<http://www.ncdhhs.gov/cstf/voice.htm> your input and suggestions to how we can improve."

Yet I have contacted you numerous times about the illegal and unethical practice of a county office that answers directly to you and you have done nothing.  If something is not done about this complaint within the next 2 weeks, we feel we have no choice but to file a lawsuit against the Wilkes County DSS, and the employees involved in this case as well as the NCDSS and you and several of your employees.  The damage that has been done to us in this case cannot be undone, but the problem could have been resolved with an actual investigation into their wrong doings, removal of the substantiation and a written apology, we have received none of those things. We are prepared to do whatever is in our power to clear our good name and remove the libel and slanderous substantiation against us. 

What upsets me the most is if they acted like this in our case, how many other cases are they doing the same things in.  How many children are slipping through the cracks because of their law violations, policy violations unethical behavior.  How many lives are they ruining with their abuse of power?

I have sent you this documentation in two seperate emails.  The other is to follow shortly it will have a list of the documents and a description of each and why it is significant.

Sincerely,


Lisa L. Nixon

Dear Mr. Benton:

This is the second installment of most of the documentation I have, if you read it and the description below, you will find that I am telling the truth in this matter.  For you to continue to ignore my complaint when you have seen the proof of the wrongs that they have committed shows a complete disregard for you position and job description as well as your own policy.  I believe it also makes you just as guilty as they are.

Below is a description of the documents attached to both of the emails I just sent you.  Look at the documents, then read the documentation for each. I am asking you to conduct a full investigation into this matter, remove the substantation against me, my husband, Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce because it is the right thing to do.  And fix the problems with the Wilkes County Department of Social Services before they are able to do this to even more people.  Because they are behaving this way in other cases. 

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

FORGED SIGNATURE

This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse

ACTUAL SIGNATURE

My husbands actual signature

FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST

This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
TEETH

This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST

This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY

If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE

This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1

This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.


LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2

I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?

COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1

Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.

Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.

My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1

Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?

PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1

This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.

PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2

If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.

SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.


ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4

This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.  But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Dear Mr. Cansler:

It is my understanding that you are the new Director of The North Carolina Department and Health and Human Services.  I sincerely hope you are a better director then Mr. Benton, who I have contacted on several occasions with documented proof of forged documents, Statutory Law violations, welfare policy violations committed against us by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, only to never receive any kind of a response from him.

I know that you are new and I am sure that some of the people in your office will tell you that what I am saying isn't the truth, but I can assure you it is and some of your employees helped cover it up.

I am asking you to view the documents that I have sent you, I suggest starting with the revised complaint against WCDSS, then view the forged signature and the actual signature on the safety assessments done by Allison Baker, who has by the way, been arrested and is awaiting trial for Felony Obstruction of Justice in regards to our case.

I have had to send all of this documentation in two installments, I ask that you read all of them, at the bottom of the second email is a description of all the documents attached, read them all, contact and speak with me because I also have recorded phone conversations that verify my complaint.   Then I ask that you conduct a full investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of not only our case, but of several others I can tell you about.

What I want: I would like the substantiation removed from me and my husband, David R. Nixon as well as Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce, because it is my belief we were substantiated against to discredit our complaints against them.  We did not do anything that even remotely resembled child abuse of neglect.  The reason they said they substantiated against us was due to parents inability to get along, we did everything in our power to get along with Mrs. Groce and I can prove this by recorded telephone conversations and video of the pick up and drop offs. 

Furthermore, their claim does not fit statutory guidelines for neglect and if parents inability to get along was actual abuse you would have to substantiate against everyone at some point.

Mr. Cansler, we have been maliciously persecuted by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services.  What has been done to us is a travesty of justice, and not only unethical, but illegal.  When CPS acts like this children die, this cannot be allowed to continue. 

Please read my complaint, view my documentation and then do something to fix what has been done to us.  We are not child abusers, we were trying to protect two little girls and when we made our report and WCDSS failed in their statutory duties we complained and they punished us for it.

When we went to the regional level NCDSS stated that they had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence, this was a lie.  They never spoke with us or viewed our evidence, someone spoke with me by phone before I contacted Atlanta, but never did anything like they stated to ACF.  And no one from NCDSS ever spoke with Tim and Kristen Wood! 

You are viewed as the principle in a principle, agent relationship with WCDSS, you have the power to rectify this situation, I am asking that you do so. 

I can be reached at 336-874-8133

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

>> Dear Mr. Cansler:

This is the rest of the documents, I am sorry about the information overload, but I find it is the only way to get our story out there.  You have to see it to believe it.  I have also pasted a description of each document that I have sent you in this e-mail. 

I have some e-mails from various government officials too, if you would like to see them.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.  The description of Documents follows my signature.

>> DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

>> FORGED SIGNATURE
>> 
>> This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse
>> 
>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>> 
>> My husbands actual signature
>> 
>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>> TEETH
>> 
>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>> 
>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>> 
>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>> 
>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>> 
>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>> 
>> 
>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>> 
>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>> 
>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.  But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.

Dear Mr. Cansler:

I am resending this information and evidence to you with the original email below because it has been exactly two weeks since I contacted you and I have had no response from you.  I am still asking that my complaint against the Wilkes County Department of Social Services be taken seriously, which up to this point I feel, it has not been.

Sir, I recently spoke with Detective Chris Handy at the Wilkesboro Police Department and he has informed me that Allison Baker's worker daily report of services to clients form number DSS 4263, for the dates of the forged safety assessment does not have our name on it.  Further proof that she did not do this safety assessment on us, furthermore there is no evidence of her doing a safety assessment or investigation of the report we made against Tammy S. Groce during that time either, which proves what I have been saying all along.

 She did not investigate our report of abuse in  the manner prescribed by law and she did not begin investigating us until after I called Raleigh, October 23, 2006 and complained about her law violations.  Check the logs, I am sure they have been sent to the state, as they are supposed to be sent on a weekly basis.  Furthermore, because they are already at the state level Wilkes County can not doctor these documents before you view them and you can view them without Wilkes County even being aware that you are looking into this matter.

I would also like to point out that this basically proves the involvement of Mary Henderson in this forged document.  These daily reports, according to your own policy, are to be turned into the supervisor on a weekly basis.  If Mary Henderson had just signed a "safety assessment on us as the supervisor on August 18, 2006, (a Friday) why did she not notice that our names were not on the log that Allison Baker turned in?  Either Mrs. Henderson was a party to this forgery or she is incompetent in her duties and incapable of working for child protective services.  I find the possibility either way disturbing. 

Check the logs and investigate my complaint as it should be and you will see that I am telling you the truth and that my husband and I, as well as Tim and Kristen Wood were unjustly substantiated against by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services.  Bradley Groce, was substantiated against and did not even know it, since his wife Tammy Groce never informed him of any of the finds, or for that matter any of the meetings he was supposed to attend.  At the very least I have shown enough of a reason for the substantiation against us to be removed.

You need to step into this matter and fix this, situations like ours should not be allowed to continue.  Innocent people should not be treated in this manner, merely because they complain because CPS is not protecting children and handling investigations in the way they are required to by law.  There has to be some kind of accountability for the behavior of the Wilkes County Department of Social Services in this case.  What they have done to us is wrong and you have the power to fix it.  I can still be reached at 336-874-8133.

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

> Dear Mr. Cansler:

It is my understanding that you are the new Director of The North Carolina Department and Health and Human Services.  I sincerely hope you are a better director then Mr. Benton, who I have contacted on several occasions with documented proof of forged documents, Statutory Law violations, welfare policy violations committed against us by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services, only to never receive any kind of a response from him.

I know that you are new and I am sure that some of the people in your office will tell you that what I am saying isn't the truth, but I can assure you it is and some of your employees helped cover it up.

I am asking you to view the documents that I have sent you, I suggest starting with the revised complaint against WCDSS, then view the forged signature and the actual signature on the safety assessments done by Allison Baker, who has by the way, been arrested and is awaiting trial for Felony Obstruction of Justice in regards to our case.

I have had to send all of this documentation in two installments, I ask that you read all of them, at the bottom of the second email is a description of all the documents attached, read them all, contact and speak with me because I also have recorded phone conversations that verify my complaint.   Then I ask that you conduct a full investigation into the Wilkes County Department of Social Services and their handling of not only our case, but of several others I can tell you about.

What I want: I would like the substantiation removed from me and my husband, David R. Nixon as well as Tim and Kristen Wood and Bradley Groce, because it is my belief we were substantiated against to discredit our complaints against them.  We did not do anything that even remotely resembled child abuse of neglect.  The reason they said they substantiated against us was due to parents inability to get along, we did everything in our power to get along with Mrs. Groce and I can prove this by recorded telephone conversations and video of the pick up and drop offs. 

Furthermore, their claim does not fit statutory guidelines for neglect and if parents inability to get along was actual abuse you would have to substantiate against everyone at some point.
>  
Mr. Cansler, we have been maliciously persecuted by the Wilkes County Department of Social Services.  What has been done to us is a travesty of justice, and not only unethical, but illegal.  When CPS acts like this children die, this cannot be allowed to continue. 

Please read my complaint, view my documentation and then do something to fix what has been done to us.  We are not child abusers, we were trying to protect two little girls and when we made our report and WCDSS failed in their statutory duties we complained and they punished us for it.

When we went to the regional level NCDSS stated that they had spoken with us and Tim and Kristen Wood and viewed our evidence, this was a lie.  They never spoke with us or viewed our evidence, someone spoke with me by phone before I contacted Atlanta, but never did anything like they stated to ACF.  And no one from NCDSS ever spoke with Tim and Kristen Wood! 

You are viewed as the principle in a principle, agent relationship with WCDSS, you have the power to rectify this situation, I am asking that you do so. 

I can be reached at 336-874-8133

Sincerely,

Lisa L. Nixon

This is the rest of the documents, I am sorry about the information overload, but I find it is the only way to get our story out there.  You have to see it to believe it.  I have also pasted a description of each document that I have sent you in this e-mail. 

I have some e-mails from various government officials too, if you would like to see them.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.  The description of Documents follows my signature.

>>> DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS

>>> FORGED SIGNATURE
>>> 
>>> This is not my husband's signature, whats more this assessment never even occurred. Allison Baker did not begin investigating us until October 25, 2006 as proven by recorded phone calls between myself and her. Two days, I might add, after I called Raleigh and complained about DSS handling of our report of child abuse
>>> 
>>> ACTUAL SIGNATURE
>>> 
>>> My husbands actual signature
>>> 
>>> FIRST LETTER FROM THE DENTIST
>>> 
>>> This is the letter the dentist wrote about how bad, Lydia's teeth were.
>>> TEETH
>>> 
>>> This is picture of my stepdaughters teeth. My husband told her mother about these cavities December 17, 2005 and the mother allowed Lydia to live in pain for the next 6 months. She would not take her to the dentist, she told my husband if he tried to pick his daughter up from school and took her to the dentist that she would have him arrested, because it was not his custody time. In order to get this little girl to the dentist we had to file for emergency custody, the mother had sent her out of the state in violation of the custody order during his two weeks in June visitation. As soon as we got Lydia, we took her to the dentist. Her teeth were so infected that she had to be put on antibiotic's and a week later had to have these two teeth extracted.

NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE DENTIST
>>> 
>>> This is the notarized statement that the dentist wrote to tell the judge and DSS just how bad Lydia's teeth were. I think it is plain from the tone of this statement that he felt Lydia had been neglected. The missed appointment that I had to cancel was one that I had made and her mother refused to take her to, stating that she had scheduled her an appointment with her "usual dentist", whom Lydia had not seen in three years. Lydia's appointment with her "usual dentist" was cancelled several times, until we pushed the issue.

LETTER CLOSING THE CASE FROM WILKES COUNTY
>>> 
>>> If you read this letter it includes the statement by the SW for us to continue to monitor Lydia's care from her mother. Now, why, if the mother is doing what she is supposed to do to take care of her child, do we need to continue to monitor her care from her mother? The day they closed the case I made a report because Lydia had bruises around her upper arm that looked like someone had grabbed her by the arm. The therapist that we were taking her to saw these bruises and felt that they were suspicious as well but that they weren't fresh enough for him to make a report...They screened this report out because I didn't state who had abused her...another stupid reason for screening out a report.

LETTER FROM SURRY COUNTY DSS CLOSING THE CASE
>>> 
>>> This is the letter from Surry County DSS that not only proves when the in home services agreement was made but also directly contradicts the letter to the Judge and their findings that we were not complying with them.

LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 1
>>> 
>>> This letter is nothing but lies and is nothing like what the SW told me in a recorded phone call that she was going to write. We did everything they ever asked us to do, while they had to fight with the mother every step of the way. We did not fight with the mother, but would call her on it when she was not fulfilling her duties as Lydia and her sisters mother. The mother would lie to DSS, still would not let them come to her home or let them see the girls.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> LETTER TO THE JUDGE page 2
>>> 
>>> I love the first paragraph on this page, tell me if you break a child's arm and it heals without permanent damage is it no longer abuse? If you don't take your child to the dentist and leave her with a toothache for over 6 month, does it stop being neglect, because those teeth are pulled? No it is still abuse, the physical ailment may have healed but that doesn't take away the neglect.

REPORT NOT ACCEPTED
>>> 
>>> This is the reason that they gave for not accepting the report that I made about the bruises on Lydia. "The child is not stating that anything adverse has happened to her." Since when does a child have to state that they are being abused for an investigation to be done. Children do not always disclose and the thing that always got me about this was the fact that they had not talked to the child at all.

MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION CONSENT FORM
If you look at this document you will see that the consent from the parents was received through intimidation and coerision. The parents were led to believe that they had no choice but to sign this document because they believed that it had been order by the County Director.

IN HOME FAMILY SERVICES AGREEMENT PAGES 1 THROUGH 6

Please note that the criteria on the Family Services Agreement is supposed to come from the Strengths and Needs Assessment. These don't.
The second page, first they are saying that David is to get medical and dental insurance on Lydia, so that inability to pay will not be an excuse not to receive treatment. This is wrong for the following reason:

1. David had insurance on Lydia when her mother neglected to take her to the dentist before.

2. David lost said insurance coverage and his job, because of DSS. Their failure to investigate this case in a timely manner, causing numerous postponements in the court case and their missed appointments were the reason he lost his job and the insurance coverage.

3. Lydia was covered under medicaid on this date.

4. This is not a DSS matter, this is a child support issue and David was well within the order of the court, which states, "when insurance is made avalible through the employer." It had not been made avalible through his employer, because David had just started a new job because DSS made him loose the other one.

5. This is not abuse, what the mother did when she would not take the girls to the dentist even though they had insurance and medicaid, that is abuse.

Page 3 In Home Family Service Agreement

Exchanges between the parents be as amicable as possible. They always had been and I have a years worth of video proving it. When the mother would yell and cuss at us we would walk away, we would not comment or we would say thank you.

DSS was well aware that there was not arguing occurring at the exchanges, because they had seen some of the video's and made inappropriate comments about the parents acting like robots, and not acting human. So which is it DSS?

Also on page 3 note that David is to attend all sessions for counseling that Tammy and David provide for Lydia. Follow the recommendations of the counselor. 3 sessions? That was all they wanted, what good does that do? Plus their own Strengths and Needs state that the child has minumal problems, what child doesn't.

Page 4 In Home Family Services Agreement

The threat of Foster Care....

Under the section of what it will take for the case to close, the only thing listed is that at least 3 counseling sessions be met. Then they closed this case before those sessions were met, saying that the order had come down to close the case, that they did not care if the counseling was completed or not.

Page 6 In Home Family Services Agreement

This is what I thought then and it is still what I think now, with one exception, after the lies that Linda Brooks told I now believe her to be just as guilty as the rest.
That concludes the In Home Family Services Agreement...tell me where is the abuse?
>>> 
>>> COMPLAINT AGAINST WILKES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SEVICES

This lays out our entire complaint

RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>>> 
>>> Read this carefully and look at what they used to keep the case open, this is not child abuse or neglect in anyway shape or form. They mark a one on lines R8 and R9 saying that we weren't complying with the in home services agreement, on this date, there was no in home services agreement. So exactly how were we failing to comply with something that did not exist? If you read the letter from Surry County DSS, it directly contradicts these findings stating that we complied with everything DSS ever told us to do and then it lists the date the in home services agreement was created.
>>> 
>>> Furthermore, when one was created all it said on it was for my husband to get dental insurance on Lydia and that the pick up and drops off should go smoothly without any arguments.
>>> 
>>> My husband had dental insurance on Lydia when her mother wouldn't take her to the dentist before and had kept coverage on her for years. We lost the insurance when he lost his job, due to DSS's failure to investigate our report in a timely manner. Because they did not do their job, the civil action we had filed kept being postponed awaiting their findings, my husband had to keep asking for days off to be in court. Then DSS missed the appointment with the psychologist and it had to be postponed, so he had to ask for another day, which resulted in him being let go because he missed too much work. I guess what really gets me is they acted like the mother couldn't take Lydia to the dentist if he didn't have insurance, but she had her on medicaid the entire time.
>>> 
>>> RISK ASSESSMENT page 1
>>> 
>>> Look at our score on this risk assessment, it is in the low box, and if you take off the boxes that they marked on the first page because it wasn't true, then our actual score would have been a one. They knew they had nothing on us to substantiate against us for, they knew they had no reason for leaving this case open...so they made something up. Even with the score they gave us, they still had to do an override, because according to their own paper work, if the score is that low they are supposed to not substantiate or keep the case open, so they lied about us not complying with the case plan in order to leave the case open.
>>> 
>>> RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 1

Pay attention to R8 and R9, now it says that we are complying and the only thing we receive a point on is my husband's age...yet they still override this low score by stating that we are not complying with the cft of 9-11-07 there was no In Home Services Agreement on this date. Furthermore they state in this that we are "Succesfully completed all programs recommended or actively participation in programs; pursuing objectives detailed in service agreement."

RISK ASSESSMENT SECOND page 2

Discretionary Override: This is a complete lie, by their own admission on this document.

RISK ASSESSMENT THIRD page 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the previous Risk Assessment, but note that the Discretionary Override is missing. So why did they override it before and not now. They never had a case against us, we never committed any kind of abuse. They did all of this to discredit our valid complaints against them, because in their minds they felt that if they made us into child abusers, no one would listen to our complaints.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 1

Good parenting skills, then why are you bothering us???

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT page 2

Look at the strengths, now look at the needs

Minor child Characteristics...What child doesn't but of course she has minor characteristic's her mother had been married 3 times in four years and was constantly bring men in and out of the children's lives introducing them to the children as this is you "new daddy". Furthermore, the mother was mentally ill. Which I might point out we were not.

Underemployed...Only because my husband lost his job because of them.

Caregiver Neglected as a child...Yes I was abused and neglect, but by their own hand I have good parenting skills. I was abused as a child...I am 38 now. Tell me what this has to do with anything?

Childs needs;

Tutoring: Well she lives with her mother fulltime, that falls on her shoulders although before DSS involvement we had already been going to the school and picking up her school work and making her make up on our every other weekend visits.

Speech problem: Again we had already contacted the school before DSS involvement about Lydia's speech and were told by them that she did not need therapy.

Not seeing Counselor: David and I had been trying to get Lydia to a counselor for years before DSS involvement, the mother would not let her go and it is hard to find someone to take her on the weekend.

STRENGTHS AND NEEDS SECOND ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2

This says the same thing as the First, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>>> STRENGTHS AND NEEDS THIRD ASSESSMENT pages 1 and 2
This says the same thing as the First, except now I guess the jobs we had were good enough, it still states that we have good parenting skills, so why are they bothering us?
>>> 
>>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 1
>>> 
>>> This is the petition that DSS filed the same day, just mere hours, after I called them and asked them why they had done nothing about Tammy's failure to attend and take Lydia and her sister to the psychologist for the evaluation. They dismissed this petition, because after they filed it she took the girls and herself.
>>> 
>>> PETITION FILED BY DSS TO GET THE MOTHER TO COMPLY page 2
>>> 
>>> If you read this page, it basically tells you that we have done what we were supposed to, while the mother had not. She would not even set up times so the SW could check on the girls, yet they dismissed the petition. The other thing I found funny was that they went after her for failing to take the girl's to the mental health evaluation, but would not do anything about her not taking them to the dentist. As a matter of fact, L:ydia's sisters teeth were not fixed until her last appointment with the psychologist, almost a year after they received their report.
>>>  
SECOND REPORT NOT ACCEPTED

This is another report that I made because Lydia had bruises on her upper right arm that looked as if someone grabbed her. The psychologist say these bruises too and felt they were suspecious, but did not report them because he was unsure of what caused them. He did state he would be watching Lydia more closely in the future. Look at why they screened this one out....

LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

In my view this is a very intimidating letter sent to try and shut me up. I am asking for more documentation because I feel that their are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I believe they do not want me to have them because there are more forgeries and falsified documents in the file. I love how he states that the case is closed. Closed or not it does not excuse their behavior in this case, nor does it end their liability.

JUDGE BYRD'S ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 20, 2006 pages 1 and 2

If you notice in this order Judge Byrd orders DSS to submit a written report of all findings, this was in November of 06. They did not submit their findings to him until May 08, and then it is not even the truth but lies. All Judge Byrd received from them was the psychologist report that was full of BS and this letter that was also full of BS. Just how long do you think you have to comply with a Judges order?
Note the first paragraph on the second page, so does this mean if you break your child's arm and there is no permenant damage that it is not abuse?

SECOND LETTER FROM DSS ATTORNEY MR. FREEMAN

Again with the intimidation.
>>> 
>>> 
>>> ALLISON S. BAKERS CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH Pages 3 and 4
>>> 
>>> This is the background check I had done on Allison S. Baker, the original Social Worker, at the Wilkes County Courthouse, May 15, 2007. As you can see Mrs. Baker has been charged with 8 Counts of Forgery, Obtain Control Substance by Fraud/Forgery. These Charges were knocked down to misdemeanor, possession of a controlled substance to which she was sentenced to probation and community service and when she complied with that they did what is known as a 90 96 Review and dismissed the charges. The point remains, someone who has been charged like this should not be working for Social Services where they remove children from the home for substance abuse by the parents.

INITIAL CASE PLAN, DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS

Nikki Hull brought this to our house when she came August 20, 2007. Even she said that this stuff made no sense as DSS is not supposed to involve themselves in custody issues. Nothing on this was ever set up or scheduled by DSS. Now if this is what they are talking about in the Risk Assessments they are responsible for setting this stuff up and they never did. In fact we were told that they decided not to use this.  But I fail to see how this could be what they are talking about, due to the date that they mention on the risk assessments, on those the date is September 11, 2007.
