Commissioner Troxler,

Please find attached a reply to your letter (Re: IR 2007-091) with a copy to those you sent Re: IR 2007-091 to and others.  I will follow up with a paper copy to you and to each of your Cc listed in Re: IR 2007-091. 

In addition to my reply to your letter I have also added below an extract from the Town of Chapel Hill, NC,  "Agenda for meeting date: 9/22/2008 Agenda #5a."  The Town of Chapel Hill, NC has taken the use of hazardous herbicides very seriously and done for its citizens what the North Carolina Department of Agriculture has failed to do.  I hope your department can learn from them as you have from me.  It is interesting to know you are using my photos and YouTube videos in your vegetation management presentations. A picture is worth a thousand words, I am glad you have found some value in my efforts. It is my hope our state laws and regulations will be modernized so there are equal laws and regulations for everyone and not just for governing bodies/town that can only enforce a "will of change" with Duke Energy or any other utility company.

Town of Chapel Hill, NC,  Agenda for meeting date: 9/22/2008 Agenda #5a

Title of Agenda Item: Duke Energy’s Easement Maintenance Notification Process


<http://townhall.townofchapelhill.org/agendas/2008/01/14/5c/>http://townhall.townofchapelhill.org/agendas/2008/01/14/5c/
In discussions with Town staff Duke Energy has agreed to discontinue the use of herbicides as part of their vegetation maintenance program for their distribution line easements within the Town’s planning jurisdiction. When utilizing herbicides as part of their vegetation management program on their transmission line rights-of-way and easements, Duke Energy has agreed to provide the Town staff with notification at least four weeks prior to initiating this work. 


Respectfully,
Tommy Walls
