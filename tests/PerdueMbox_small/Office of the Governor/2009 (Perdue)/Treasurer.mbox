Subject: NC 401(k) Plan investment inquiry

Ms. Buchanan,

I received the feedback you sent to the Governor’s Office and the State Treasurer’s Office on the upcoming changes to the investment options for the NC Supplemental Retirement Plans.  I wanted to provide you with some additional information about the new investment options that may address some of your concerns about the risk level of the new investment options versus the old ones.

Some of the fund fact sheets for the current lineup of mutual funds say that the risks are relatively low.  For example, Growth Fund of America is "Below Average" and all of the others are either "Below Average" or "Average".  However, the new investment options are not mutual funds, rather they are institutional separate accounts, created just for members of our two supplemental retirement plans to invest in.  The new fund fact sheets are all rated "High Risk", except for Fixed Income.  On first glance, it does appear that the investment risk is increasing for participants.

However, if you read the description of “Investor Risk Profile” on the Fund Fact Sheet User's Guide, the current mutual fund fact sheets show risk relative to the Morningstar Category, while the new North Carolina fund risk profiles are based on volatility.  Thus, the current mutual fund fact sheets compare a stock fund to similar stock funds, in which case the risk is usually Average or Below Average.  The new North Carolina fund fact sheets compare a stock fund to all investments and stock funds tend to be High Risk relative to fixed income or stable value funds.

Also, please note that based on the feedback we’ve received so far regarding the timing of the changes, the Board of Trustees met late last week and decided to extend the deadlines for opting out of the fund mapping and for the asset transfer date.  The deadline to opt out of the fund mapping has been extended to February 27, 2009 and the date that the plan funds will move to the new investment options has been extended to March 6, 2009.  This deadline extension will hopefully give members more time to evaluate the new investment options and make a determination about what they would like to do regarding the fund mapping.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

Ellen

Office of the Governor:

We will be happy to respond to Mr. Rasmussen and <mailto:cc.governor.office@nc.gov>cc.governor.office@nc.gov with our reply. 

The body of our response will likely indicate to Mr. Rasmussen the effect that "the Retirement Systems Division has no knowledge of any proposed legislation regarding early retirement incentives."  However, since his inquiry seems somewhat budgetary in nature, we do not know if the Governor's Office would like to include any additional information along with our response.

Please advise if your office would like to add any comments or information with our response or whether your preference would be that the Retirement System just respond at this point. 

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions in the interim.

Thank you,

David Starling

Dear Ms. OVERMAN :



We are responding to you at the request of the Office of the Governor.



We are sorry to learn of the illness of your mother and hope she will recover quickly so this difficult decision can be avoided. We have received your request for an early retirement and reviewed your circumstances. However, we find that you are not eligible to apply for an early retirement until you attain the age of 60 with an effective retirement date of February 1, 2015.

As a member of the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System a member becomes eligible for a reduced retirement at age 50 with 20 years of creditable service or at age 60 with 5 years of membership service. However, a member will be eligible for an unreduced retirement at age 60 with 25 years of creditable service, or age 65 with 5 years of membership service, or at any age with at least 30 years of creditable service

According to our records, you currently have 13.7500 years of service, and you are age 54 as of the effective retirement date you have proposed.

You may consider contacting your Human Resources Department to inquire about Family Medical Leave or you may withdraw your contributions from the retirement system upon your termination of employment. Please keep in mind when you withdraw your contributions you also withdraw all rights to any future benefits from this retirement system – your prior service will also be withdrawn. You can purchase your withdrawn service once you have completed 5 years of Membership Service in your current Retirement Account after returning to service.



If we may be of further assistance, please contact us at the address or telephone number listed below.

Sincerely,



Douglas C. Mayer

Mrs. King:



Your inquiry regarding retired teachers has been forwarded to us from the Governor's Office.



Currently, the Retirement Systems Division knows of only one piece of proposed legislation extending the sunset for retired teachers to return to the classroom.  That legislation is House Bill 229 and you can see further details at <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=HB+229>http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=HB+229.  You may also wish to contact your Legislator for further information or details which may be available.  The internet website for the North Carolina General Assembly is <http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/>www.ncga.state.nc.us. 



We hope that our response has sufficiently answered your question.  Please let us know if we may be of additional assistance in any way.   



Sincerely,



David Vanderweide

Well...in my case, that would be because I failed to open it.  ...I'm SO sorry; it just slipped through a crack. 



I think that is a great response.  Thank you...and again, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.
