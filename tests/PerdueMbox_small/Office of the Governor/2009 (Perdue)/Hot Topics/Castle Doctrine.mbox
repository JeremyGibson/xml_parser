Subject: North Carolina Castle Doctrine

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I would urge you to support a "Castle Doctrine" law as proposed by N.C. Senator Brock. Many of our surrounding states currently have approved this approach to self-defense without the doomsday predicted by anti-gun advocates. North Carolina's current self-defense laws are a legal nightmare that leave victims of dangerous criminals in a situation that can expose them to legal and financial ruin on one hand, or serious injury or worse on the other hand. Our current economic situation will only create an environment of increased criminal activity and risk of violence for innocent citizens. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Michael Jacques

Comment: Hello NRA is working with State Representative Mark Hilton (R-96) and State Senator Andrew Brock (R-34) to introduce "Castle Doctrine" self-defense bills, which will seek to allow law-abiding citizens to use the force they deem necessary against a violent criminal attacker to protect themselves wherever they have a legal right to be. The bill also provides civil immunity for those who defend themselves from criminal attack. Cosponsor the "Castle Doctrine" self-defense legislation when it is introduced and support passage of this critical reform. Thank you. Danny.
