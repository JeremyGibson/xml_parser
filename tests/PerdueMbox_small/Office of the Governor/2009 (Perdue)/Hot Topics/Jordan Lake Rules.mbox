Dear Governor Perdue:

Please accept this letter as a statement of strong opposition to the Jordan Lake Rules as they are currently written and being considered for implementation.

As business owner/operators in Alamance County, we are concerned about the proposed Jordan Lake Rules and how they will impact our and other businesses in our community.

Jordan Lake was initially conceived as a flood control lake and was not originally intended to serve as a drinking water supply.

We believe that what agriculture is remaining in Alamance County will be unable to cope with and conform to the new rules, forcing family farms to close and disappear from our area.

We believe that industry may not be able to conform to the draconian rules and will be forced to relocate.  This is especially troubling, considering that a majority of the textile jobs have drained from our county in the past decade due to other factors.

We believe that counties and communities downstream from us, who are using the water from the Haw and New Hope Rivers for drinking water, are looking for a way to cheapen their own costs to purify water for drinking at our expense.

We further believe that the Haw River is being singled out and that other rivers east of Alamance County are not being targeted in the same way.  Industries and communities along the Haw have for three decades now been diligent in cleaning up their emissions and water treatment facilities at great expense already.  We here in Alamance County have been forward-thinking in constructing water impoundment and treatment facilities to serve our own needs, and should not be further penalized for lack of similar foresight in our neighbors.

We look forward to further discussion on the Jordan Lake rules, and urge you and other lawmakers to be realistic in your expectations of Alamance County's, and those of others counties, abilities to comply with the current proposals.

Thank you.

Dear Governor Perdue,

This email is to call to your attention recently introduced NC state legislation. House Bill 3 (filed 01/28/2009) would disapprove all of the Jordan Nutrient Strategy rules adopted by the EMC and approved by the RRC.  The bill has not yet been assigned to committee.

 The primary sponsors are Cary D. Allred (district 64, Alamance) and Darrell G. McCormick (district 92, Iredell, Surry, Yadkin).  The co-sponsor is John M. Blust (district 62, Guilford).

Not only is House Bill 3 incredibly irresponsible and detrimental to Jordan Lake, a major water supply (and recreation area) for the Triangle, but it will completely waste all the time, effort and money put into this effort by taxpayers and officials for over a decade.

Our new U.S. president has made it clear that he listens to the average American (as opposed to the special interests of the privileged), and he understands the challenges we are facing, including the environmental peril facing our planet and the need to be responsible stewards of the land.  ( I invite you to read Barack Obama's environmental position papers at: <http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/EnvironmentFactSheet.pdf>http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/EnvironmentFactSheet.pdf )

I hope you will follow his lead.

Sincerely,
Melissa Rooney

I do not understand or appreciate the political or special interest motivations from the out of district sponsors of this bill.  Jordan Lake is a vital water resource for the greater Triangle area.  What are the true and specific motivations by Mr. Allred and Mr. McCormick in ignoring the recommendations of the NCEMC and RRC? 

Extensive time and effort has been expended by Triangle taxpayers, volunteers, organizations and officials for well over a decade seeking environmental and other protections for the Lake Jordan watershed.  Pollution is already a factor.  Stringent controls must be implemented to further protect and restore the water quality within Jordan Lake.  

It is obvious the sponsors of this bill do not represent nor serve the best interests for the residents within the Triangle.  You are our governor.  I humbly implore your effort to protect our Jordan Lake watershed and to direct your influence to facilitate the defeat of this irresponsible bill. 

Respectfully,

Ronnie Griffin
