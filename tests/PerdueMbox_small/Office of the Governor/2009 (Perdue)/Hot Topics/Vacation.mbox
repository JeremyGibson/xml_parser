Subject: Your Vacation!

Comment: I find it deplorable that you are a month into your governorship and vacationing. I would love to be in a warm climate like you. That is like the media is saying it was arranged before you were elected, sorry doesn't cut it with me. And you will say it is a working vacation, privately paid not coming out of our "pockets" so to speak. The things going on our country right now, I think demands you be at home and on all that is going on! I hope you enjoy your vacation and to me it is at the expense of those that voted you in..btw I didn't! Shame one you!

Subject: The governor's holiday. pinch my toes and call me a jelly donut

Comment: To the office of Governor Perdue. What is she thinking? The rest of us are trying to decide if we should take a vacation or not this year. What type of job do you work one month and then take a week off. There is a crisi Governor Perdue. I even voted for you, what type of message are you sending. You're tired. How about all those people who are out looking for a job. How many sleepless nights have they had? You don't see Obama and Hagen out in the sun somewhere do you? What did you do those two monthes between the election and when you took office? I don't know but this is bad timing and really looks bad. And to beat it all I voted for you. When I saw this news I said to myself, "Pinch my toes and call me a jelly donut." Get back to work governor so others can.

Subject: Vacation already

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I am amazed that you are alreay on a vacation this early in your term serving our State. Surely your advisors must have told you how this looks, especially in these trying times for our citizens. I hope and pray you use better judgement in the future in State matters than you have shown in this vacation you have taken so soon. I supported you in your campaign, but you have to produce for me to continue to support you. So far, I'm extremely surprised and disappointed in you. Yours is a serious job, ma'am, and I hope you take it more seriouly in the future.

Subject: Vacation

Comment: Governor Purdue, I want to express my concern and disgust at your taking a vacation barely into office. Media says it was planned before you took office, have you ever heard of cancelling plans. My child is a student at Northen High School in durham....she does not have a textbook to call her own to bring home and study...they have to share in school. And our "leader" who needs to be in the office working on problems such as education is off partying in a warm climate "out of the country" as the Lt. Gov. was quoted as saying. I must say..."YOU HAVE LOST MY VOTE" as well as numerous members of my famiy. People are furious that you could leave NC on vacation so soon. Enjoy these 4 years!!!!

Comment: does the governor's spokeswoman think we're stupid enough to believe that she doesn't know where the governor is vacationing? While saying "I'm not at liberty to disclose that information" is preferable to insulting our intelligence. The governor promised to make her administration more transparent - this is a bad start.

Comment: Madam Governor, while I am a conservative who generally votes Republican I want to tell you that I do not criticize your vacation as some ( and some Republicans ) will do. While we may be in troubled economic times I do not believe that you taking a privately funded vacation is a problem or that it is any ones business other than your own. If you have the money to go then you should freely be able to decide how you spend your money. If you get this while you are on vacation then I hope you enjoy your vacation. If you get this after your return then I hope everything went well. Thanks

Comment: Well, I am sure am happy that there is not enough going on in our state, such as the financial crisis, to keep you on your job. I hope you have enjoyed your vacation while a lot of people in this state can neither afford nor dream of going on a vacation. You must be so proud of yourself. If this is what you call governing then I want someone else because this is what I call running away and letting everyone else suffer. I shook your hand at my graduation at ASU but only because I had to. Right now I would rather spit in your hand than shake it.

Comment: I voted for you and now you go on vacation? I have not had a proper vacation in 4 years and currently work 3 part time jobs so I can barely pay the immediate bills (excluding the debts because I just can't pay those off). I hope you can do something to help the state out of the current situation but I just don't see how yet. Please make me feel like my vote was not wasted!

Comment: Gov Purdue, I voted for you and felt you really were going to be the breath of fresh air we needed. I am a 50 year old married, father of 4 with major health issues. People like myself with these health problems know how expensive it is, not can be - but is! However, I'm not writing to you for assistance with that, unless you want to help people like me out, cause we have been promised to only to be swept under the carpet instead for years! Rather I'm writing to ask why you felt you had to take this vacation after just a couple weeks in office. You said it was set up long ago etc, etc but with thousands of NC workers losing there jobs or already lost their jobs and thousands more NC residents disabled and have to choose between food and gas or prescriptions, doctor visits or many of the other things us disabled need just to stay alive - not comfortable -- alive! Do you know how much most Soc Sec Disability people receive a month? I get less than $1,000.00 a month and have several prescriptions, dr appoint's, etc that has to come out of that. And you say that you had to take this vacation because of a penalty if canceled? How much sympathy and/or support do you think you'll get now? Maybe acceptable and understandable to people with no worries about their jobs or their money. But this vacation is a huge slap in the face to me and many, many other NC residents. Shame on you Gov. Purdue, shame on you!

Comment: I was disappointed to learn that you are already taking vacation when you have just got into office. Haven't we already have enough of the good old boys club? Isn't it time for a change? We are losing jobs and are one of the highest taxed states in the Union. We need tax cuts, we need to have our dollars spent better. Wake up! - unless you want to be a one term Governor. Rich Saxton This is the only state where we have to continually pay taxes on our cars! Why do some states manage without State Income Tax but we not only have that but so much more.
