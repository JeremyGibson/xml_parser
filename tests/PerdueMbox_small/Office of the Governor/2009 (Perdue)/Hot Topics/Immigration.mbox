Subject: Immigration in the work force.

Comment: I would like to express my opinion concerning immigration in the work force. My wife and I have sold our home that we lived in for many years and were our children were raised. I am now retired but my wife is still working. We decided to buy an older home and remodel and add on to the house. We set out to find a contractor to over see the work, which we did and made a very good decision on the selection. As most builders, they have sub-contractors to do much of the work. I was able to do some of the light work and I was on the job most every day working along side some of the sub-contractors. Most of the workers knew that I was the homeowner and they would come to me for directions when the builder was not on the job. I did not have any issues with them coming to me, the problem was communication with the workers. Many times it was finger pointing or just hand jesters during the communications. Sometimes the communications were wrong and the work had to be done over. I will give one example of the work that was wrong; a roofing contractor was in the process of closing for the day when I had walked across the yard to pick up some material that I needed for my work. I had looked up to admire the roof when I saw an area that was not properly covered. I knew the weatherman was calling for rain that evening and knew the house would leak. I called over the job foreman to point out the area that was in question we stood there for about five minutes and he kelp saying to me ‚ÄúNo Speak English‚Äù. I dropped the subject and hoped it would not rain during the night. It did rain and the house leaked and some damage was done. I called the builder and he sent his crew over to put a tarp on the roof. If the communication had been better then this problem could have been avoided. All the workers have done a great job on the house and I cannot complain concerning their work or skills. ¬∑ Suggestion: I believe if the people from other countries are in the work force, then it should be mandatory that each sub-contractors sending a crew of men to a job site should be equipped with at least one ENGISH SPEAKING person for the communication. I have discussed this with my builders and he told me it is a real bad problem and he has seen it get worst in the last few years. Not only it is not good communication it is also a safety hazard when two people cannot communicate properly. I know this will add to the red tape of doing business but it is a problem indeed. This was only one job for me and I can only imaging what a problem it is for the daily contractors trying to run their jobs. I also believe the official language in this country is English. Thank you for your consideration into this matter. Dewey Simms

Subject: Nat'l Impact Survey of Illegal Immigration/Judicial Watch

Comment: Today I mailed this handwritten letter along with the survey I received in the mail....1/27/09 To Whom It May Concern: I can personally attest to having direct knowledge and experience to many of the concerns listed on the National Impact Survey of Illegal Immigration on Conover, NC Taxpayers petition.....please see below..... #1. My neighbor (2 doors down) is on disability. She says she is married but goes by her maiden name. The man she says she is married to (& has a son with) is an illegal alien. She told me this personally. She said she is the breadwinner but she doesn't work. He does - in construction as a painter. #2. I worked last year for J & S Cafeteria in Hickory. I was told by those that would know that most of the employees (over half of 70 to 90 employees) are illegal aliens. The manager knows what he is doing (Randy is his name). His assistant, Buffy, lives with her boyfriend who I also believe is illegal. She related the story of taking a friend or relative who is illegal to the hospital and when questioned by a hospital employee that she told them to 'shut up' and just do their job - because she knew they could not be turned away - due to law. J & S Cafeteria does approximately 4 to 5 million dollars in business yearly. They do not require their servers to report tips. Both the manager & asst. manager mentioned herein speak fluent Spanish. #3. I recently worked for Catawba Valley Medical Center as Registrar in the Emergency Dept. My job was to acquire insurance info & other demographics. Of the 500+ patients I received and registered over a less than 90 day period probably greater than 70% either stated they did not work or have insurance or presented Medicaid cards as their insurance coverage. The greater percentage of these were Hispanic. They, most all, seemed to know that the hospital would not (or is it could not?) refuse to treat them. Please feel free to contact me at any time. Sincerely, Brenda Murray 828.464.2277 P.S. I am unable to contribute monetarily. Please ensure that Governor Bev Purdue receives a copy of this letter.

Subject: Ways to trim budget

Comment: Governor Purdue, one huge way to trim our state's budget is to take a long, hard look at the many illegals in this state, who should not be here. So much money is spent toward their being here illegally - health, education, and their contributions to so many accident (many fatal) on our highways. Just in the last day or so, the accident caused by an illegal with a garbage truck in Raleigh that involved four or five vehicles with the driver of the garbage truck being critically burned/injured. Is there anyone who will listen to the common sense approach of the average North Carolinian to do something and soon to eliminate the illegal alien problem our state has. They have no respect for our laws and get away with things legal citizens could not. I have no problem with anyone being here, but only if they are legal. Please help our state's citizens to have a voice in this massive problem. Thank you.

It cost the state $1 BILLION dollars to support illegal immigration!

The Costs of Illegal Immigration to North Carolinians

http://www.fairus.org/site/News2/1303092600?page=NewsArticle&id=19723&security=1601&news_iv_ctrl=1761

North Carolina has a rapidly growing illegal alien population of about 385,000 persons, and the fiscal burden on North Carolinians resulting from public services used by that population is similarly increasing. The federal government estimated North Carolinaís illegal alien population at 380,000 persons as of 2007.

The growth of the illegal alien population since 2000 accounts for all of the total foreign-born population increase over the same period. It also accounts for more than one-sixth (17.7%) of the stateís total population increase.

The rapid growth of the illegal alien population prompted the state legislature to take action to deny driverís licenses to persons without a Social Security number or valid visa as of August 2006. Since then state agencies have had to verify the legal employment status of their new employees. Additionally, seven counties and the Durham police department have entered into Section 287(g) agreements with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that train and deputize local law enforcement personnel to work cooperatively in immigration law enforcement.

These measures are a positive response to public opinion in the state. A Rasmussen/FOX poll of North Carolina voters found in 2007 that more than seven out of ten respondents agreed that it is ìvery important to for the government to improve border enforcement and reduce illegal immigration.î An earlier Elon University poll found that 56 percent responded that ìimmigrants are a burden on the state because of the jobs, housing and health care they take.î To the extent that these enforcement measures encourage illegal aliens to leave the state, they should help Governor Perdue cope with an anticipated one to three billion dollar budget deficit.

Subject: Chatham County

Comment: Please see videos following letter. Dear Governor Bev Perdue, I represent the national organization ALIPAC, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, which represents over 25,000 Hispanic, black, and white Americans as well as many LEGAL immigrants on immigration issues. I am writing you today to insist that you reconvene and reconsider your votes on the measure instructing local law enforcement not to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Last night, on January 27, a room full of 35 people including members of the media indicated that they had no prior knowledge that your board was going to consider or vote on such a resolution. I was informed that you stuck this measure on at the end of some kind of planning workshop and each person who gave input was in favor of the resolution. How dare you make such a dramatic policy decision, which is contrary to the wishes of over 80% of your constituents, without adequate public notification or public comment. Politicians should not make decisions that could cost North Carolinians their property and lives without allowing the taxpayers to have input before you vote! It appears that your intent was to deprive your constituents of due process and open government. If this was not your intent, then I challenge you to reopen the issue with adequate foreknowledge and access to the public and the media. If you fail to take immediate action to rectify this injustice you have perpetrated against the fine people of Chatham County, then your silence will speak volumes and it will indicate that your maneuvers were an intentional effort to deprive our citizenry of having a voice in local government. Furthermore, I must advise you that according to many certified polls, your decision on immigration matters is contrary to the wishes of over 80% of Americans. From a Zogby poll in April 2006 to the polling data from the JWP Civitas Institute in Raleigh, NC, Americans have made it clear that over 80% favor local police enforcing immigration laws. I would like to know, what each of you will have to say to the families in Chatham County when their loved ones are injured, maimed, or killed by illegal aliens who had been in and out of your custody many times beforehand? You cannot say that there was nothing you could do. The honest truth will be that you prevented anything from being done and you will therefore share a high degree of culpability in the crimes of the illegal aliens you let run amok in Chatham County. Your degradation of the political process by passing this measure without public knowledge and participation is deplorable. The decision you made is contrary to your responsibility to represent the views of your constituents. The decision you made will cost some Chatham Country residents their very lives. You have made Chatham County our state's lone Sanctuary County, and illegal aliens, especially the ones involved in criminal activity, will come flooding into the area quickly and your crime rate will rise. In areas of the state and nation where 287g has been implemented, crime rates have fallen. In surrounding areas that did not implement 287(g) crime rates have risen. Of course, you did not have access to any of this information before you made a very bad policy decision because you did not allow anyone opposed to the measure to know about the vote or to speak out. I look forward to hearing of your decision to rectify this injustice and affront to open government by calling for a new vote on the measure during a normal County Commission meeting, where business is conducted with full citizen and media oversight and input. William Gheen President, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC www.alipac.us PS: I have attached links to videos of our meeting in Pittsboro last night for you, since you decided not to attend the event. I hope you will listen carefully and understand that we will be organizing to demand better government responsiveness to Chatham Citizens from your board.

Comment: Why would my elected representatives, federal, state and local, give FREE taxpayer money to illegal aliens in the form of: 1) education for their children 2) free health care 3) welfare 4) food stamps 5) social security and, if a pregnant illegal makes it across the border, 6) free childbirth medical assistance And, from what I saw on Lou Dobbs on CNN, my elected representatives in Congress are going to give every illegal alien an amnesty which entails: 1) no punishment for breaking laws 2) no payment of back taxes 3) more FREE taxpayer money 4) even gang members are getting amnesty!!! Now, the American citizens know why the United States is in such dire financial circumstances. It seems like my elected representatives are willing to take everything from American citizens and give it to every one else in the world. God help you all and God help America because my elected representatives are selling us down the river. I am a former Marine, Vietnam Vet and I and so discouraged at the downward slide of my country into socialism and third world nation status that my elected representatives are perpetrating on us LEGAL American citizens.

Comment: as a former resident of NC who lived in triad area for 30 years, and intends to come back when the economy turns to the better to be closer to my children and my wifes parents, I would love to see you ballance the state budget by restricting some of the handouts to illegal aliens, I have a paper put out by FAIR that shows the cost of illegal aliens in NC to be 997 million while SC is just 186 million which in my opinion is 186 million too much, it is not the American citizens job to care for the illeglas they don't belong here at all, I would hope that the legislature and you would do something in your budget sessions to eliminate this problem, just look at the few construction jobs in your state and see who is doing them, their kids are in your schoools all of them ues your emergency rooms for doctors offices, and the list goes on, help you state and your your citizens by working on this most serious problem

Subject: illegal immigrants

Comment: I would like to know why I am living in a town that has no jobs available but we have a large amount of illegal immigrants living in this town that are employed and not paying taxes. Is there a reason that no one has created a job that specializes in checking companies that are employing illegals. I do not see one illegal working in a store but the town is over ran with them and I see them shopping and walking out the door with enough food to feed ten families. They are given food stamps and are receiving aide and they are not legal citizens. I work in a place that sells beer and wine and a big portion of the customers are hispanic. I have one customer that is hispanic and he tells me that he and a couple other people are the only ones that are legal. I ask for identification when they come in and most do not have a drivers license only a mexican identification and they are driving vehicles with north carolina tags. How is this. I had to have insurance on my car and a valid drivers license before I could even get a tag. Also I know many that drink away their disability checks and they are more able to work than I am. I am in chronic pain 24 hrs a day but I get up and go to work every day I am scheduled and I lift 50 to 100 of cases of beer a day to stock my store. But I was told that I would have to be out of work for 6 months before I would be even be considered for disability. I think all towns and cities should have an office that tracked disability fraud and companies hiring illegals. My husband I work hard to pay our bills and I do not like that I have to spend my taxes to pay someone to sit on the bottom all day and drink beer or take food out of my mouth to give them welfare. In order to keep most jobs you have to pass a urine test. I think that should also apply to the people who sit around drawing disability and welfare . Why should we pay for people to drink and do drugs all day while they could be working the same as me. Sincerely, Wendy Palmer

Comment: Mrs. Perdue I and alot of my friends are concerned about the situation in catawba county and our neighboring counties. Most of everyone has one or both members in their household already laid off or getting ready to be laid off. We are losing everything a little at a time. People can't handle much more between the news and what they see around them it is pretty bad around here. I work at corning the OAP plant they just announced they are closing the entire plant and everybody is gone. That is close to 500 people. We are drowning a little at a time. Things aren't much to me but my lively hood is. I need to know who we can contact or what we need to do to get some help around here. Obviously people can't set back and wait for help to arrive on its own. We are going to have to do something to get more attention to our crisis. They forced us to take the day off; tell our families of the news and process the information. I'm using my day to try and help us. I know we can't save the plant , but I am willing to work. I just hope I can find another job before it is too late for me, and I lose everything too.

Comment: Dear Governor, There is allegedly millions of illegal immigrants living and working in NC. They consume a large part of NC services ,ie. medicaid, medical,schools etc and for the most part do not contribute to the tax base (local,State and Federal).Most importantly, they are stealing NC American citizen jobs!! They do not belong here. What part of the word ILLEGAL is being missed by the self interest groups whose use this "Cheap Labor Force" on construction jobs, landscaping work and a host of other jobs that North Carolina legal residents could perform. We need your leadership in reducing NC 's unemployment rate. On the Insurance issue, most citizens cannot afford the proposed insurance increase. Help, Help, Help is what we, the people you have been elected to govern need from your office. God save NC and America

Comment: Don't let this happen to our state. From the L. A. Times 1. 40% of all workers in L. A. County ( L. A. County has 10.2 million People) are working for cash and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants working without a green card. 2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal , whose births were paid for by taxpayers. 5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages. 7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border. 8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal. 9. 21 radio stations in L. A. are Spanish speaking. 10. In L. A. County 5.1 million people speak English, 3.9 million speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people in L. A. County. ) (All 10 of the above are from the Los Angeles Times) Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare. Over 70% of the U nited States' annual population growth (and over 90% of California, Florida , and New York) results from immigration. 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens. Please don't let let trends like this continue in our state. Enough is Enough.

Subject: illegal immigration

Comment: my comment is that there are so many illegal immigrants in this state that the financial and social burden is too much for the legal citizens to be asked to bear. My livelyhood in the construction industry has been decimated by illegal labor. i dont want a handout i just want a fair chance to work for a living wage and have a decent standard of living. there is enough labor in this state to do the jobs needed without illegal immigrants

Comment: EDITORIAL U.S. Rep. Sue Myrick Representing North Carolina‚Äôs Ninth District April 2006 Contact: Andy Polk (202) 225-1976 Illegal Aliens Are Hurting North Carolina This week the U.S. Senate has been debating illegal immigration. There are currently 12 million illegal aliens in the United States. North Carolina has the 8th largest illegal alien population in the county estimated at 300,000. There is fierce debate everywhere on what to do with illegal aliens who have sneaked across our borders. As we engage in this debate, I want to share some statistics that I believe support cracking down on illegal immigration. Steven Camarota, of the Center for Immigration Studies, recently released a report titled ‚ÄúDropping Out: Immigrant Entry and Native Exit From the Labor Market, 2000-2005.‚Äù This report disproves many of the myths associated with illegal aliens and the workplace. This report shows that immigrants (legal and illegal) compose the majority of workers in just four out of 473 major occupations in America. The other 469 are composed of large majorities of Americans. Therefore, the argument, that immigrants do jobs that Americans don‚Äôt want, is contradicted by the statistical facts. The report reveals that 83 percent of illegal aliens have no more than a high school education and are overwhelmingly employed in only a few occupations. In these high-illegal occupations, unemployment for American workers, of the same educational status, averages 10 percent, or double the national rate. In fact, unemployment for these American workers has increased by 952,000 people from 2000 to 2005. At the same time 1.54 million immigrants, half of which are estimated to be illegals, with no more than a high school education, received jobs. The report even breaks down the unemployment statistics for North Carolina, showing a clear trend. In 2000, there were 89,000 unemployed North Carolinians who have no more than a high school education. In 2005, there were 118,000. At the same time employment for immigrants who have no more than a high school education increased from 145,000 to 267,000. The point is, there are 3.8 million American workers, 118,000 in North Carolina, of the same educational status of many illegal and legal immigrants who are looking for work. The report concluded, ‚Äú‚Ä¶it is very hard to see any evidence of a labor shortage that could justify allowing illegal aliens to stay or to admit more as guest workers‚Äù. Call me old fashioned, but I believe that American workers deserve the first shot at American jobs. I believe in our laws. I believe that we should seal off our borders, and enforce our immigration laws. That is why I voted for the House-passed Border Security and Illegal Immigration Enforcement Act. If we can‚Äôt control our borders, no immigration laws we pass, or programs we create, will solve our immigration problems. Let me be clear. I do not support amnesty. Illegal aliens must go home, follow our laws, and apply to come here like all other legal immigrants. Anything else rewards illegal behavior and punishes legal immigrants. I know there is no practical means to send 12 million illegal aliens home. We don‚Äôt have the tools, resources or manpower. That is why at some point in the future we will have to discuss setting up a foreign labor program that gives illegals incentives to go back to their country and apply to come here legally. However, we can‚Äôt begin discussions on this until our borders are secure and we are enforcing out immigration laws. Again, no immigration program will work if we can‚Äôt control our borders. Currently, I support expanding the new Homeland Security online program that allows businesses to check the legal status of potential workers. This program ensures businesses are in full compliance with the law, and stops illegal aliens from trying to get a job with fraudulent identification. Many disagree with my stance. They say that sending illegal workers home would damage our economy because of the void they would leave. However, I believe if illegals were sent home, businesses would find ways to develop new technology to increase production and lower costs. In the 1960‚Äôs, California tomatoes growers relied on the government ‚Äúbracero‚Äù program that allowed Mexicans to come and pick tomatoes. Congress stopped the program even though the growers said it would kill their business. After the program was stopped the growers did 5 times the previous business because scientist developed ‚Äúoblong‚Äù tomatoes that could be picked by a machine. In addition, businesses can hire the 3.8 million Americans who are of the same educational status and skill set as the illegal aliens. Businesses may argue that labor costs may rise as a result. However, wages for American male high school drop-outs have dropped 1 percent over the past 5 years, and have only increased 3 percent for high school graduates compared to 10 percent for more educated Americans. It seems that with a growing economy, a slight increase in wages for a small percent of workers is not going to harm the economy. A 10 percent increase for more educated Americans, a larger set of workers, certainly hasn‚Äôt. So our economy would not be damaged by obeying American laws and sending illegal aliens home to then apply through the legal system. American workers would find jobs, and obtain wages that would help them get off government programs. Businesses would create new technology that would lower costs, and could actually help our economy expand further. I think this debate can be summed up best by the late Congressman Sonny Bono. When asked about his position on illegal immigration he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs illegal.‚Äù Americans must keep the same focus. Illegal aliens are here illegally, and we must recommit ourselves to enforcing our laws and securing our borders. ### Editorial List

These hispanics come over here with there fake identifications buy cars,building materials and numerous items on credit and just go and get a new name. Thew don't ever pay for these items.This is why they can do the work soo cheap. I worked around this hispanic guy that has had three different names in three years. I am now out of work and if our laws were enforced I would have a thriving construction company. Instead I am sitting at home e mailing you hoping for some kind of action. Please do something to help all of the unemployed american citizens. Thank you Mark Woodard

Comment: Honorable Gov. Perdue, What steps are you taking to reduce the number of illegal aliens in our state and to discourage them from coming here? I think we should not provide any government services to illegal aliens. Also all state and local government agencies should be required to report and assist ICE in returning these persons to their countries of citizenship. Regards, Paul Leto

Why is taxpayer money being given to illegal aliens?



I sent this to my 3 elected Congressional representatives in Washington, DC abut it also applies to my elected representatives here in North Carolina.



I just got done doing my tax return and I am pissed off. What the hell is going on up there in Congress by my elected representatives? Why in the name of God are you people taking so much from the poor people of this country and giving it to everybody else in the world? Why are we being taxed to death so that my elected representatives can give it all away? What are you people thinking about?



My wife and I† make less than $80,000.00 a year, live in a double wide manufactured home and drive 2 used cars. We are not rich but we get taxed so that you all can give it to illegal aliens in the form of welfare, food stamps, FREE education for their kids, FREE health care and social security (using stolen social security numbers, no less). Plus, who knows how many billions of dollars are being sent overseas in the form of redistribution of wealth by my elected representatives?



I am a veteran of the U.S. Marines and the Vietnam War and I am getting more pissed off daily by the bullshit that I see coming out of Washington, DC. You people had better start getting your priorities straight and start remembering what country's citizens that you are supposed to represent!!! This is still the United States of America and you people should start acting like you are valid, ELECTED representatives of this country. William Nick, Sr

Gov. Perdue

Illegal immigration is not just about Juan and Maria are just here taking jobs Americanís will not nor cannot do, it is also about illegal aliens who are terrorists posing as Latinos. These facts are being obscured by the ridiculous assertion that Americans are lazy and do not work, only Hispanics work hard. Bull! Please never forget that we have illegal alien terrorists in the nation that would love to kill us. Think about this when the subject comes up.

Terrorists teaming with drug cartels

The Washington Times

By Sara A. Carter
August 8, 2007

Islamic extremists embedded in the United States ó posing as Hispanic nationals ó are partnering with violent Mexican drug gangs to finance terror networks in the Middle East, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration report.

"Since drug traffickers and terrorists operate in a clandestine environment, both groups utilize similar methodologies to function ... all lend themselves to facilitation and are among the essential elements that may contribute to the successful conclusion of a catastrophic event by terrorists," said the confidential report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times.

The 2005 report outlines an ongoing scheme in which multiple Middle Eastern drug-trafficking and terrorist cells operating in the U.S. fund terror networks overseas, aided by established Mexican cartels with highly sophisticated trafficking routes.

These terrorist groups, or sleeper cells, include people who speak Arabic, Spanish and Hebrew and, for the most part, arouse no suspicion in their communities.

"It is very likely that any future 'September 11th' type of terrorist event in the United States may be facilitated, wittingly or unwittingly, by drug traffickers operating on both sides of the United States-Mexico border," the DEA report says.

Rep. Ed Royce of California, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs terrorism and nonproliferation subcommittee, said the DEA document substantiates information that his committee has been given in the past year.

"Hearings I held in Laredo [Texas] last year and this DEA report show that our southern border is a terrorist risk," Mr. Royce said. "Law enforcement has warned that people from Arab countries have crossed the border and adopted Hispanic surnames. The drug cartels have highly sophisticated smuggling and money-laundering networks, which terrorists could access."

Garrison K. Courtney, spokes- man for the DEA, would not comment on the document. However, he said that the DEA, which has only 5,000 active agents worldwide, is sharing information with other U.S. intelligence agencies and working closely with local law enforcement.

"We focus on drugs, but we keep our eyes open for any connection that can aid our other partners in law enforcement," Mr. Courtney said. "Everything we do relies on our ability to gather intelligence. We have said for years that there are shades of gray in the organizations we're dealing with. Intelligence requires us to look at the whole picture. Realistically to leave out a certain set of dots could be a huge mistake."

In the two years since the report was written, other DEA intelligence officials have said they are still struggling to cooperate with and share and gather information from other lead U.S. agencies charged with fighting the war on terrorism.

Lack of information sharing between U.S. intelligence agencies is creating a blind spot in the war on terror and has left the U.S. vulnerable to another attack, the report states.

"We are the eyes and ears when it comes to gathering intelligence on the cartels and smugglers," said the DEA official. "What we know for sure is that persons associated with terrorist groups have discovered what cartels have known all along ó the border is the backdoor into the U.S."

According to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report obtained by The Times, nearly every part of the Border Patrol's national strategy is failing.

"Al Qaeda has been trying to smuggle terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally into the United States," the 2006 document states. "This organization has also tried to enter the U.S. by taking advantage of its most vulnerable border areas. They seek to smuggle OTMs [other than Mexicans] from Middle Eastern countries into the U.S."

Peter Brown, terrorism and security consultant, stated that the "biggest element" to the DEA report is the ease with which terrorist cells have taken on new identities.

"The ability for people to completely transform their nationalities absent of their own identities is a dangerous step in the evolution of this cross-border operation," he said. "This is a true threat."

Lending credence to Mr. Brown's concern, an El Paso, Texas, law-enforcement report documents the influx of "approximately 20 Arab persons a week utilizing the Travis County Court in Austin to change their names and driver's licenses from Arabic to Hispanic surnames."

Under the current drug-intelligence collection, analysis and reporting posture, the DEA runs the risk of failing to detect or report the entry of terrorists, weapons of mass destruction or portable conventional weapons into the United States, according to the DEA document.

Many times, smugglers don't know what they are transporting.

"Despite all the pronouncements of the administration that these networks and their funding is being traced," Mr. Brown warned, "progress has been limited, and in certain circles of intelligence, they are nonexistent."

Californian seeks hearing on Islamic, Mexican ties

Rep. Ed Royce, California Republican, said recent reports expose U.S. vulnerability.

A ranking House Republican yesterday demanded a hearing based on recent reports that Islamic terrorists embedded in the United States are teaming with Mexican drug cartels to fund terrorism networks overseas.

Rep. Ed Royce, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs terrorism and nonproliferation subcommittee, said the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) document ó first reported yesterday by The Washington Times ó highlights how vulnerable the nation is when fighting the war on terrorism.

"I'll be asking the terrorism subcommittee to hold a hearing on the DEA report's disturbing findings," said Mr. Royce of California. "A flood of name changes from Arabic to Hispanic and the reported linking of drug cartels on the Texas border with Middle East terrorism needs to be thoroughly investigated."

Likewise, Rep. John Culberson, Texas Republican, said the DEA document revealed startling evidence that Islamic radicals are camouflaging themselves as Hispanics while conducting business with violent drug-trafficking organizations.

"I have been ringing the bell about this serious threat of Islamic individuals changing their surnames to Hispanic surnames for three to four years," Mr. Culberson said. "Unfortunately, Homeland Security's highest priority is to hide the truth from Congress and the public. I just hope we're not closing the barn door after terrorists have already made their way in."

Mr. Culberson, a member of the House Appropriations homeland security subcommittee, yesterday wrote a letter to the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. David E. Price, North Carolina Democrat, requesting a full investigation and hearing into the matter. A spokesman for Mr. Price said the committee is contacting the law-enforcement agencies and will work closely with Mr. Culberson's office on the matter.

"We certainly want to learn more about the matter from the agencies involved," said Paul Cox, press secretary to Mr. Price.

The 2005 DEA report outlines several incidents in which multiple Middle Eastern drug-trafficking and terrorist cells in the U.S. are funding terrorism networks overseas with the aid of Mexican cartels. These sleeper cells use established Mexican cartels with highly sophisticated trafficking routes to move narcotics ó and other contraband ó in and out of the United States, the report said.

These "persons of interest" speak Arabic, Spanish and Hebrew fluently, according to the document.

The report includes photographs of known Middle Easterners who "appear to be Hispanic; they are in fact, all Spanish-speaking Arabic drug traffickers supporting Middle East terrorism from their base of operations" in the southwestern United States, according to the DEA.

Michael Maxwell, a senior analyst with the House Appropriations homeland security subcommittee, said that the report is evidence that terrorism cells exist in the U.S. and are being aided by dangerous narco-trafficking cartels.

"While the procurement of fraudulent or multiple identities by terrorists to hide criminal activity is not new, the information suggests terrorist tradecraft is evolving and relationships now exist between Mexican and Middle Eastern individuals or groups, embedded here in the United States," he added.

The ties are as deep as family, according to the DEA report, which said that a Middle Eastern member of the Muslim Brotherhood, involved in narcotics sales and other crimes, married into a Mexican narcotics family.

"One of the targets of this investigation is an Arabic man," the document said.

A 2006 Department of Homeland Security intelligence report ó also obtained by The Times ó said that Al Qaeda has tried and is planning on using the Southwest border to enter the U.S.

Mark Juergensmeyer, director of the Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara and a terrorism specialist, said that links between terrorism and narcotics trafficking have been well-established in foreign nations, such as Afghanistan.

But Mr. Juergensmeyer said the DEA report linking terrorist organizations in the United States to Mexican drug cartels displays a new evolution in terrorist tactics and poses a serious concern in the area of security.

"In some ways, that's even more frightening to think that drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico may adopt some jihadist ideology," he said. "If it's an ideology being adopted by a drug culture then that makes this situation very dangerous."

Drug cartel terrorist ties known in 2001

Asa Hutchinson

A former director of the Drug Enforcement Administration warned federal officials shortly after the September 11 attacks that violent drug cartels from Mexico were teaming with Muslim gangs to fund terrorist organizations overseas.

Asa Hutchinson, who also has been a Homeland Security undersecretary, said that in 2001, DEA agents uncovered the link between the drug cartels and terrorist groups but too few government officials listened.

"I think it's important to recognize that the link between terrorism and drug trafficking exists," said Mr. Hutchinson in a phone interview from Arkansas. "While we are fighting terrorists, we should not neglect our fight against drug traffickers. We shouldn't neglect it, because the link is there."

Last week, The Washington Times disclosed a confidential DEA report substantiating the link between Islamist sleeper cells in the U.S. and Mexican drug cartels. The report, which included several documented U.S. investigations into the terrorist/cartel connection, stated that Middle Eastern operatives funded terrorist groups with drug money linked to Mexican cartels.

Furthermore, the 2005 document suggests that some Islamist terrorists are disguising themselves as Hispanics.

In 2001, Mr. Hutchinson said, he told federal officials that terrorists would use any internal weakness if government officials failed to maintain adequate resources, a foolproof immigration system and enhanced border-security measures. He became director of the DEA just one month before al Qaeda operatives hijacked four U.S. jetliners and killed almost 3,000 people.

"After September 11, our agents interviewed some of our sources in Mexico," Mr. Hutchinson said. "During the course of that, they started seeing the connection globally between terrorists and drug trafficking."

During his three years at the DEA, he said, intelligence agents discovered that Middle Eastern gangs were having pseudoephedrine, an over-the-counter drug, shipped from China and smuggled into the U.S. from Canada, to Mexican drug syndicates for manufacturing methamphetamine.

These "large bulks" of pseudoephedrine were then sold to cartels and transported with the aid of the Muslim gangs to "super meth labs" in Mexico. The proceeds from those sales were then transferred to Middle Eastern terrorist organizations.

"We know some of the money wound up back in the hands of terrorist organizations in the Middle East," Mr. Hutchinson said. "It is a partnership of convenience. The drug cartels would probably like to distinguish themselves from terrorists, but their tactics are nearly the same. They just may not ask what they are smuggling. They may not know; they may not care."

Afghanistan, he said, may be one of the most obvious examples of narcotics profits funding terrorist groups, particularly the Taliban militia that harbored Osama bin Laden before the September 11 attacks. According to the U.N. World Drug Report for 2007, which was issued last month, Afghanistan is responsible for 92 percent of the opium produced in the world last year.

"Wherever you look globally, you see extremist groups benefiting from drug trafficking," he said. "You see the Taliban benefiting from opium. We see money coming from drug trafficking in the United States making its way back to terrorist groups overseas."

The 2005 DEA report includes photographs of known Middle Easterners who "appear to be Hispanic; they are in fact all Spanish-speaking Arab drug traffickers supporting Middle East terrorism from their base of operations" in the southwestern United States. These "persons of interest" use fake U.S. documents and their facility with Spanish allows them to blend in.

"I believed that was a possibility from the time I became director of the DEA," Mr. Hutchinson said. "It should be no surprise to anyone that terrorists would exploit our weakness."

Comment: I have been in NC for 20 years, I have watched as illegal workers cut myself and hundreds of other North Carolinians out of work. I have yet to see any sign of local, county or state law enforcement bitting down on what is hurting NC blue collar workers. Are we waiting for the illegals to run for Govenor or President before we realize their is a problem. Please explain to me why I am in Texas looking for work and my family is in NC fighting a foreclosure. But yet illegal workers live in my town work in my neighborhood and law enforcement drives on by. This is a very frustrating situation, signed, Away from home and hungry.

Subject: Crime / Illegals / Borders / Protection

Comment: Governor Perdue: Please read below at what we are facing in the U.S. I am even more stressed about immigration because my uncle‚Äôs car was hit by another car full of illegal‚Äôs (this happened several months ago). They ran and then hit another car a mile or two away. The police got to them and reported it but there wasn‚Äôt an arrest. By the way they had beer and liquor in the car. My uncle‚Äôs car was totaled and of course the illegal‚Äôs have no insurance. By the way, my aunt went to where the illegals car was impounded and they were there picking it up and left. My aunt fussed at the cop releasing the impounded illegals car and he threatened to charge her if she did not shut up. The only people that are under the law in this country are the ones who are legal citizens and work and pay taxes! This email comes in three parts: Part 1: In just one year. Remember the election in 2006? Thought you might like to read the following: A little over one year ago: 1) Consumer confidence stood at a 2 1/2 year high; 2) Regular gasoline sold for $2.19 a gallon; 3) The unemployment rate was 4.5%. Since voting in a Democratic Congress in 2006 we have seen: 1) Consumer confidence plummets; 2) The cost of regular gasoline soar to over $3.50 a gallon; 3) Unemployment is up to 5% (a 10% increase); 4) American households have seen $2.3 trillion in equity value evaporate (stock and mutual fund losses); 5) Americans have seen their home equity drop by $1.2 trillion dollars; 6) 1% of American homes are in foreclosure. America voted for change in 2006 and we got it! Remember its Congress that makes law not the President. He has to work with what's handed to him. Quote of the Day........"My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world. I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it." -- Barack Obama Part 2: Taxes... Whether Democrat or a Republican you will find these statistics enlightening and amazing. www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html Taxes under Clinton 1999 /Taxes under Bush 2008 Single making 30K - tax $8,400 /Single making 30K - tax $4,500 Single making 50K - tax $14,000 /Single making 50K - tax $12,500 Single making 75K - tax $23,250 /Single making 75K - tax $18,750 Married making 60K - tax $16,800 /Married making 60K- tax $9,000 Married making 75K - tax $21,000 /Married making 75K - tax $18,750 Married making 125K - tax $38,750 /Married making 125K - tax $31,250 Both democratic candidates will return to the higher tax rates It is amazing how many people that fall into the categories above think Bush is screwing them and Bill Clinton was the greatest President ever. If Obama or Hillary is elected, they both say they will repeal the Bush tax cuts and a good portion of the people that fall into the categories above can't wait for it to happen. This is like the movie The Sting with Paul Newman; you scam somebody out of some money and they don't even know what happened. PART 3: You think the war in Iraq is costing us too much?

For years I've wondered why our government hasn't acted to stop the flood of illegal aliens pouring into our country. I've heard complaints and questions. The excuse usually given by politicians is, "They do jobs our citizens won't do."

†However, the people with whom I have discussed the topic usually respond, "Not true. We used to do those jobs."

†If farms need the help, a farm registry program should be set up, but stop illegals who are taking other jobs - including construction jobs - that our own citizens want. Unskilled jobs taken by illegals are needed by our citizens as unemployment increases.

These illegal aliens are costing taxpayers billions, mainly for their education, health care and prisons. It has been estimated that illegal aliens cost the state of California $9 billion a year.

A report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, based in Washington, D.C., estimated $7.7 billion yearly to educate the children while special English classes and school lunch programs add even more.

At a cost of $63 a day, taxpayers spend more than $3 million dollars a day to house alien prisoners, most of whom are thought to be illegals, in federal prisons.

†Census officials estimate 10 million to 12 million aliens are in the U.S., but illegals tend to avoid the census so a larger estimate of 18 million was made in 2005 by the chairman of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus.

†The Los Angeles Police Department bans immigration enforcement and mirrors other large cities in this practice. One captain was quoted as saying, "We can't even talk about it. People are afraid of backlash from Hispanics. I would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about it (enforcing immigration laws)."

†In Los Angeles, 95% of homicides are reportedly attributed to illegal aliens. Two-thirds of all fugitive warrants are for illegals. Authorities attribute 60 percent of all drug traffic to illegals.

†People in all the border states are alarmed.

†The U.S. is in serious economic trouble. Illegal aliens are costing multiple billions every year for services. Further, much of what illegals earn is sent to their families in Mexico and doesn't come back, adding to the drain of money out of the U.S.

†There are many who will shriek "Racism!"

†We are in a struggle for the economic survival of the U.S. We face terrible debts and unemployment. Laws exist against this invasion by illegals and those who hire them. These laws need to be enforced.

The first thing that comes to mind is the comment by Sen. David Hoyle, a Gaston County member of the Communist, Socialist, Progressive, Marxists, Liberal, Radical Islamic, RINO, Compassionate Conservative, & Democrat PartyÖ."We couldn't afford it.î Senator, please keep in mind, this is taxpayerís money, and quit spending it like it is water.

Didnít the state have about $2 billion dollars left over in a previous year and you folks spent it instead of giving it back to taxpayers or at least depositing it in our rain day fund. America is broke!

The "official" debt of the United States is only around $11 trillion dollars, before useless stimulus packages. This is a manageable number; we could pay it off in a few decades if we quit buying luxuries like food and clothing, and take a few other minor economy measures. Unfortunately, the "$11 trillion" number was produced by government accounting, which among other things allows one to ignore Social Security, Medicare, and the new prescription drug benefit. This is like ignoring rent, food, and utilities in your household budgetÖ it will lead to a few bounced checks. Our real debt is about ten times higher.

Who says so? The President of the Dallas Federal Reserve, Richard W. Fisher. In a May speech at the Commonwealth Club of California, he states that the US national debt is close to $100 trillion. You can <http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080528.cfm>read his whole speech at the Federal Reserve web site. <http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/index.cfm>http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/index.cfm

RALEIGH -- The federal government's economic stimulus may siphon money out of North Carolina's treasury at the same time it is shoveling dollars in.

The plan signed into law by President Obama on Tuesday funnels $6.1 billion to the state for projects such as roads and schools. The federal tax breaks in the plan, however, may force state officials to offer parallel state tax cuts that would cost the state at least $760 million during the next two years.

"Everybody's talking about what we're going to get," said state Sen. Dan Clodfelter, a Charlotte Democrat and a co-chairman of the Senate committee on tax laws. "But nobody is talking about what we might be losing." State lawmakers were banking on the federal government to provide money that would help close an estimated $2 billion gap in next year's budget. The stimulus package provides some of those dollars.

At the same time, state Revenue Department officials estimated that the cost of changing state tax laws to mirror the federal tax cuts in the stimulus plan would run $340 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $420 million for the next year, according to a copy of the figures provided by two senators.

Those figures could grow.

"We have folks looking at it," said Secretary of Revenue Ken Lay, a former bank executive from Charlotte.

The $787 billion federal stimulus includes $282 billion in tax breaks. Among them are breaks for businesses that the states often mimic, such as accelerated tax write-offs for equipment and computer purchases.

Individual tax breaks that the state ordinarily would copy include a temporary increase in the earned income tax credit and suspending the tax on the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits.

The state legislature would have to approve changes in state taxes, and North Carolina historically has followed Washington's lead on tax laws. During the last recession in 2002, though, the state did not follow some of the federal tax cuts passed at the time.

"We couldn't afford it," said Sen. David Hoyle, a Gaston County Democrat and another co-chairman of the committee on tax laws.

Now lawmakers are again faced with the question of whether to copy federal tax breaks while trying to close a budget gap.

"In this environment," Hoyle said, "that's just not likely to happen."

The idea behind the tax breaks is to help sustain businesses and their jobs. Sen. Pete Brunstetter, a Winston-Salem area Republican, said the federal tax breaks are written with the intention that states will follow suit, providing a break at both levels.

If the state doesn't offer the breaks, too, "you won't get the full benefit of the tax cut," Brunstetter said.

Comment: From 6 million to 7 million illegal immigrants currently hold jobs in the U.S. ‚Äî jobs that could be taken by the millions of less-educated native Americans who are now unemployed. The United States needs to take a firm stance on enforcing theses laws. Our President has recently been televised telling us that we need to be responsible. That we have a financial crisis going on. Lets make sure that these jobs are available to legal citizens of The United States. Thank you, Robin Perrin

Subject: Ilegal aliens and Christians

Comment: I have two major problems and I think they need to be addressed. One give Christians back their rights to be able to say Merry Christmas, have the ten commandments displayed, or any other Christian symbol they so desire. All these other people, the atheists and Muslims that this seems to offend, don't seem to get it. They have the right to look the other way or turn a deaf ear to Christian prayer, Merry Christmas, or the posting of the ten commandments. This country was founded on the basis of free religion. Well these groups are infringing upon the rights of Christians everywhere. If God offends them so much, then perhaps they had better stop handling American money because on it it says In God We Trust. Help give God back to America. Another thing is all this coddling and free help that is given to illegals living in this country. They are given resources that even some American citizens are denied. Send them back where they belong, or make them take the long road as the majority of people who have come to the United States. They should learn English. That is the language spoken over here. Stop giving them medicaid and foodstamps. The American taxpayers are the ones footing the bill for all these programs that are so easily given to these illegal aliens who have no right to them. Stop this travesty and give American back to the God fearing Americans as it should be. Take a stand for what is right and do something about it. Susan O'Neal

For years I've wondered why our government hasn't acted to stop the flood of illegal aliens pouring into our country. I've heard complaints and questions. The excuse usually given by politicians is, "They do jobs our citizens won't do."

†However, the people with whom I have discussed the topic usually respond, "Not true. We used to do those jobs."

†If farms need the help, a farm registry program should be set up, but stop illegals who are taking other jobs - including construction jobs - that our own citizens want. Unskilled jobs taken by illegals are needed by our citizens as unemployment increases.

These illegal aliens are costing taxpayers billions, mainly for their education, health care and prisons. It has been estimated that illegal aliens cost the state of California $9 billion a year.

A report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, based in Washington, D.C., estimated $7.7 billion yearly to educate the children while special English classes and school lunch programs add even more.

At a cost of $63 a day, taxpayers spend more than $3 million dollars a day to house alien prisoners, most of whom are thought to be illegals, in federal prisons.

†Census officials estimate 10 million to 12 million aliens are in the U.S., but illegals tend to avoid the census so a larger estimate of 18 million was made in 2005 by the chairman of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus.

†The Los Angeles Police Department bans immigration enforcement and mirrors other large cities in this practice. One captain was quoted as saying, "We can't even talk about it. People are afraid of backlash from Hispanics. I would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about it (enforcing immigration laws)."

†In Los Angeles, 95% of homicides are reportedly attributed to illegal aliens. Two-thirds of all fugitive warrants are for illegals. Authorities attribute 60 percent of all drug traffic to illegals.

†People in all the border states are alarmed.

†The U.S. is in serious economic trouble. Illegal aliens are costing multiple billions every year for services. Further, much of what illegals earn is sent to their families in Mexico and doesn't come back, adding to the drain of money out of the U.S.

†There are many who will shriek "Racism!"

†We are in a struggle for the economic survival of the U.S. We face terrible debts and unemployment. Laws exist against this invasion by illegals and those who hire them. These laws need to be enforced.

WHY ARE WE BANKRUPT?

More Than 6 Million Illegals Hold Jobs





Wednesday, February 18, 2009 3:23 PM

By:†Jim Meyers


A








from 6 million to 7 million illegal immigrants currently hold jobs in the U.S. ó jobs that could be taken by the millions of less-educated native Americans who are now unemployed.

A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) discloses that 12.8 million native-born high school dropouts and young American natives with only a high school education are unemployed.

Among all native-born adults with a high school diploma or less, 24.3 million are unemployed.

The unemployment rate among native-born high school dropouts is 17 percent. But the rate among legal and illegal immigrants without a high school diploma is only 10.6 percent.

The CIS, an independent research organization, notes that illegal immigrants are ìoverwhelmingly employed in lower-skilled and lower-paying jobs,î but adds that ìit is difficult to find any evidence of a shortage of less-educated workersÖ

ìIf the United States chose to more vigorously enforce immigration laws over the next year, and this resulted in 1 to 2 million illegal workers deciding to leave, it could significantly improve the employment prospects for less-educated natives.

ìAn economic downturn would seem to be the ideal time to step up enforcement because such efforts would be buttresses by the economic situation, and a recession is the time when Americans, especially the poorest and least educated, are most in need of jobs.î

The CIS points out that an average of 138,000 new foreign workers were authorized each month in 2008, and one-third of adult immigrants have not completed high school.

The CIS observes: ìThis raises the serious question of whether such a high level of immigration makes sense, given the current concern about joblessness.î

Gov. Perdue:

Please keep this in mind so you can initiate action to get Americanís back to work.



You can thank our Communist, Socialist, Progressive, Marxists, Liberal, Radical Islamic, RINO, Compassionate Conservative, & Democrat Party for this. Their public relations group, the Useless Drive-By Media aids them. They both want to destroy America through outsourcing of our jobs to countries like Communist Red China and insourcing the estimated 1.5 billion world workers earning $2.00 or less a day. They are more than willing to take your jobs while you pay to educate their children and provide them free medical care. The globalist new-world order folks like the socialist/communist U.S. Chamber of Commerce are heavily pushing this. Do you know they filed a lawsuit against DHS and the taxpayer funded E-Verify program? It is time to boycott all chamber of commerce members until they send a letter to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce telling them to knock it off so Americanís can go to work.

Stimulus may aid illegal workers

The federal bill does not require employers to verify an employee's legal status, and it's estimated that 5,000 undocumented workers in North Carolina will benefit.

By Franco Ordonez - The Charlotte Observer

Thousands of North Carolina jobs and millions in wages created from the federal economic stimulus package could wind up going to illegal immigrants [aliens].

Congress stripped language from the $787 billion package that would have required employers to verify the legal status of workers paid with stimulus money.

The White House estimates the package will generate or save an estimated 105,000 jobs in North Carolina over the next two years.

While it's impossible to say definitively how many illegal immigrants [aliens] will get jobs, multiple studies estimate at least 14 percent of the construction labor force is in the U.S. illegally. Experts say actual numbers are likely much higher.

North Carolina could get $1.3 billion for highway and school construction, which, based on federal estimates, could mean more than 5,000 jobs for undocumented workers [aliens].

"That's not right," said Jon Holstead, 24, a Charlotte electrician helping to build Salome Church Road Elementary School near Lowe's Motor Speedway. "You have Americans out of work, but you have illegal immigrants [aliens] coming to work."



February harsh on job market

February is shaping up to be another brutal month of job losses: The number of laid-off workers receiving unemployment benefits hit an all-time high of 4.99 million for the week ending Feb. 7, The Labor Department reported Thursday.

Also reported Thursday:

Wholesale prices jumped 0.8 percent last month, the biggest gain since July and well above the 0.2 percent increase that economists expected.

The New York-based Conference Board said its January index of leading economic indicators rose 0.4 percent, the second straight monthly gain.

However, economists dismissed the gains in both wholesale prices and economic indicators as temporary blips that did not signal either a problem with inflation or a potential rebound in the economy.

The stimulus package was a popular topic this week at the school construction site where Americans and immigrants work side-by-side. Several immigrants on the project said they are working without proper legal papers.

A masonry worker, Juan Luis, 28, said Latinos are struggling as much as anyone.

"People say Latinos [aliens] take our jobs, but no one wants to do the kind of work we do," he said. "Americans just don't see it that way."

[FRANKíS NOTE: If this was true, just how did we get the jobs done before illegal aliens? This was a statement by <http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ei=0x-gSaW9JpjAtgedsoyMDQ&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&q=El+Presidente&spell=1>El Presidente†Bush and it is also stupid. BOTH political parties have done absolutely nothing to fix what our government did to us during LBJís Great Society in 1965. The government studies everything so why are there no cost and environmental studies on illegal immigration at the federal, state, and local levels?

The Supreme Court wrongly ruled in 1982, American taxpayers had to finance the education (K-12) of illegal alien children. What has been the cost at the local, state, and federal levels? Why are there no studies? What has been the overall impact to the ìNo Child Left Behindî program? We are forced to cram illegal alien kids into our classrooms where they are not academically fast enough to keep up, thus grades suffer. Why are there no cost and environmental studies? In Wake County, NC, it costs $9,420 to educate a single child. Ask our politicians; especially Sen. Burr and Sen. Hagan, why there no studies? Ask them to initiate a cost and environmental study on the overall cost of illegal immigration since 1965. How can anyone make a decision without the facts and cost?]

More than $770 million of the state's stimulus money is expected for roads. A 2006 Observer investigation found illegal immigrants -- using Social Security numbers that were fake, stolen or belonging to dead people -- working for major N.C. road-building companies. Using a sample of payroll records from large contractors, including Rea Contracting and Blount-Sanford Construction, the newspaper found questionable Social Security numbers for a third of 85 workers.

[FRANKíS NOTE: On August 3, 2007, ICE and other law enforcement agencies arrested the owner of Tarrasco Steel in a probe for hiring 77 illegal aliens doing jobs Americanís want to do. Jose S. Gonzalez falsified and altered information on their <http://www.ice.gov/exec/leaving.asp?url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-9>I-9 Employee Eligibility Forms. These are critical infrastructure construction sites.]

The unemployment rate in North Carolina was 8.7 percent in December; in South Carolina, 9.5 percent. Last year, S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford, who's one of a handful of Republican governors who are considering turning down money from the stimulus package, signed legislation that requires S.C. businesses to verify immigration status. North Carolina has no such law or policy.

The House of Representatives included an amendment in the original stimulus bill that would have required all recipients of stimulus money to use E-Verify, a federal program that checks Social Security numbers. House and Senate negotiators removed the requirement in the final version.

Supporters of E-Verify acknowledge errors but say the program still effectively identifies illegal immigrants. [FRANKíS NOTE: The study is 99.6% effective and takes seconds to complete. The employer cannot initiate the DHS E-Verify request until a job offer has been made.]

"Would it keep out every illegal? No," said Steven Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that advocates stronger immigration enforcement. "Like in anything, is there going to be fraud? Sure. ... The point is this could be an important tool to deter illegal employment."

Although they voted against the overall stimulus package, state GOP legislators such as Rep. Sue Myrick supported keeping verification in the bill.

The office of Rep. Patrick McHenry, a Cherryville Republican, said he joined other Republicans in a letter disagreeing with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which recommended not including E-Verify in the stimulus package.

Sen. Richard Burr, a Winston-Salem Republican, said in a statement: "E-Verify is an important tool to help us enforce laws already on the books, and it is unfortunate the Senate was not given an opportunity to vote on the provision."

Opponents of E-Verify say it would hinder the economic recovery.

In a recent statement, the Immigration Policy Center, a pro-immigrant research [ a immigration law foundation that benefits from illegal aliens] group, said E-Verify is "deeply flawed and ensnares American job-seekers in database errors, adds to the costs incurred by employers required to use it, and does not actually prevent undocumented immigrants from getting jobs." [FRANKíS NOTE: This is a grossly inaccurate statement to say the least! The process takes seconds to complete. It is much like paying as bill with a debit card. It takes seconds and is 99.6% accurate.]

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that expanding the federal verification program could cost $17 billion over the next 10 years.

A 2006 study by the Kenan Institute at UNC-Chapel Hill estimated that Hispanics poured more than $9 billion a year into the economy even after saving or sending home 20 percent of their income.

The spiraling economy has sent some immigrants back to their home countries. Those who remain are vying for far fewer jobs -- often in competition with blue-collar American workers. [FRANKíS NOTE: This is a flawed study paid for by the North Carolina Bankers Association. Look at independent studies such as one by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR) <http://www.fairus.org/>http://www.fairus.org. Go to their website and link to the recent study, <http://www.fairus.org/site/News2/1590770182?page=NewsArticle&id=19723&security=1601&news_iv_ctrl=1761>The Costs of Illegal Immigration to North Carolinians (2008). Read, ìThe Fiscal Impact of Immigrationî by Edwin S. Rubenstein http://www.esrresearch.com/Rubensteinreport.pdf

During a break from installing fire sprinklers at the Salome Church Road school, Thomas Peck, 29, and Robert Vanderburg, 26, sat in Peck's truck to discuss the economy and their hopes for the stimulus package. Looking over at the Latino masonry workers, they said friends could use some of those jobs.

"The more immigrants come over here, the less jobs we have," Vanderburg said. "They come and work for $6 or $7 an hour. An American needs $15 to $16 to get by."

†FNC



SEAN HANNITY, HOST: The group is responsible for over 50 attacks on U.S. soil and has over 35 compounds right here in our very own nation. Now, a new investigation by the Christian Action Network has uncovered some disturbing information about the spread of homegrown terrorists and what they mean for America.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

HANNITY (voice-over): It's a frightening thought: Islamic terrorist training camps right here in America in our backyards. The group Muslims of America, or Jamaat ul-Fuqra, as they're called in Pakistan, have established over 35 communities across the U.S.

The group claims to be peaceful, but a videotape uncovered by the Christian Action Network shows that they can have a much more sinister side.

The video, called "The Soldiers of Allah," features Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani, the mastermind and the leader of the group here in the U.S.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are establishing training camps. You can reach us. At you know, Quranic open university offices in New York, or in Canada, or in Michigan, or in South Carolina or in Pakistan. Wherever you are, you can reach us.

HANNITY: The tape goes on to teach Gilani's American followers tactics in guerilla warfare, including scaling mountains, subduing enemies, murdering guards, hijacking cars, kidnapping, weapons training, and setting off explosives.

Gilani is a Pakistani national best known for allegedly setting up journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. Pearl was on the way to meet with him when he was abducted and eventually gruesomely beheaded.

Armed with the, quote, "Soldier of Allah" training video and a history of Gilani's terrorist rhetoric, investigators went to several of the compounds to confront his followers.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are a liar, and you are a liar.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't say another word.

HANNITY: They were met with denial, hostility, and in some cases, even violence.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Clearly looks like either knife holes or bullet holes.

HANNITY: And the question remains: why have these communities been left to flourish here in the U.S.? And is it only a matter of time before this anger spills on over into a violent incident?

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HANNITY: And Martin Mawyer now joins us.

Thirty-five facilities in the U.S. Tell me this ó tell me this is not true, and how does this continue to exist?

ï <http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,494424,00.html##>Video: Watch Sean's interview

MARTIN MAWYER, CHRISTIANACTION.ORG: There's 35 compounds, villages, communities that Sheikh Gilani has inside the United States. They range anywhere from the East coast of New York to South Carolina to the West Coast, Seattle, Washington, and from New York down to Texas.

HANNITY: Knowing the extremism that you're talking about, that he advocates here, and this is not in dispute, correct?

MAWYER: No, it's not in dispute.

HANNITY: Then why would the United States government allow these facilities to stay open?

MAWYER: Well, we spent two and a half years investigating this group, and during that time we interviewed law enforcement about why these groups, why these facilities were allowed to exist in the United States.

We got a host of reasons, but the No. 1 reason is they are protected by the U.S. Constitution, and they are protected by state constitutions in the United States. Really, law enforcement's hands are tried in trying to shut these groups down.

HANNITY: I want you to explain to our audience here, because you're describing this particular man, his involvement, you say, in the Daniel Pearl, you know, beheading. How certain are you that every one of those compounds shares the radical views?

MAWYER: We went to seven of these compounds. We had the "Soldiers of Allah" videotape, which your viewers just watched. And we said, "We're going to set out on a mission. We're going to visit the seven compounds we were aware of and ask their leaders to watch this tape, either accept or reject Sheikh Gilani's call to be an Islamic guerilla warfare training camp." None of them rejected the tape.

HANNITY: How is he connected specifically to each and every compound?

MAWYER: Well, each and every compound is owned by a group called Muslims of America. Muslims of America in the United States is their American name for a group based in Pakistan called Jamaat ul-Fuqra.

HANNITY: Which is the one that he is ó and these are his words, and this is what his advocacy is.

So in other words, let me guess, and you tell me if I'm wrong here. So that when you went to the seven compounds, of the 35, if you were to ó if they were to condemn the statements of him, that would mean to them what? For them what?

MAWYER: Well, actually, none of them would condemn them. These people believe Sheikh Gilani is the direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, that he speaks for the Prophet Mohammed. They file ó follow him with utmost loyalty. They believe basically, he's speaking for the word of Allah. They will not condemn him. They will not criticize him. That's what we learned.

As a matter of fact, in one camp in Georgia one of the leaders watched the "Soldiers of Allah" video tape and said what's wrong with Sheikh Gilani setting up paramilitary training camps inside the United States? I encourage your viewers to watch this tape to see what happens.

HANNITY: Do you think ó you think Gilani's facilities in the U.S. are planning attacks on American cities and ó it's almost unimaginable in a post-9/11 world that that could exist. You're saying you think that they're planning, plotting, scheming the next attack against the Americans?

MAWYER: Not only do I believe that, not only would people who watch this documentary believe that, but even the law enforcement officials that we have spoken with, not the ones based in Washington, D.C., but the field officers, they believe that. We've had law enforcement tell us they have weapons of mass destruction, that they...

HANNITY: What ó what kind of weapons of mass destruction?

MAWYER: Well, in some cases I can't even tell you, Sean, because the confidential information that was given to me by these particular law enforcement officials.

HANNITY: You're saying without a doubt you can look in these cameras tonight and tell the American people that there are terrorist training camps on our soil, we're not doing anything about it, and they're planning, and they will hit America?

MAWYER: I would say without a doubt al Qaeda would love to have such compounds that range from 25 acres to 300 acres sitting on American soil in order to hide terrorists, hide weapons, and train future jihadists for the United States. It's shocking.

HANNITY: Mr. Mawyer, it's shocking. Thank you for being with us. Appreciate it. Thank you for your time.

MAWYER: Thank you.

Watch "Hannity" weeknights at 9 p.m. ET!

ìHomegrown Jihad:
The Terrorist Camps Around U.S.î
A Documentary You Must See!!

By Brigitte Gabriel




You have to see this to believe it!

A new documentary film entitled ìHomegrown Jihad: The Terrorist Camps Around U.S.î has just been released. I know the expression ìa must-seeî is over-used --- but in this case itís right on target.

This is a must-see film.

For several years there have been news reports and commentaries circulating about the Jamaat ul-Fuqra compounds here in the U.S. Jamaat ul-Fuqra, known as ìMuslims of Americaî here in the U.S., has close to 40 such compounds here in our country.

I discuss these compounds and the founder of Jamaat ul-Fuqra, Sheikh Mubarak Gilani, in my book They Must Be Stopped.

But just as a picture is worth a thousand words, a film is worth 10,000 words. ìHomegrown Jihadî is compelling, shocking, even frightening. As I said --- you must see it.

The producers of this film, PRB Films in association with the Christian Action Network, have done America a tremendous service in putting this documentary together. They have ìconnected the dotsî between the terrorist actions and intentions of Sheikh Gilani and these compounds. In this film you will see:

* Law enforcement and media documentation of the dozens of criminal and terrorist acts that have been perpetrated by Jaamat ul-Fuqra followers here in America.
* Extensive clips from a chilling Jamaat ul-Fuqra terrorist training video entitled ìSoldiers of Allah.î You could be living near a compound where this training is taking place. Even if youíre not, itís only a matter of time before a Jamaat ul-Fuqra member engages in a terrorist act somewhere in America.
* Aerial video of many of the camps, as well as footage of Christian Action Network officials going to the camps to talk with Jamaat ul Fuqra members. In one instance the cameraman is assaulted and their car is attacked. Some of this footage is very intense.
* Interviews with terrorism experts, law enforcement officials, and people who live near the camps. In one segment youíll be shocked to learn how Colorado law enforcement officials and even Coloradoís governor asked for FBI assistance in dealing with one of these compounds ñ to no avail.
My words simply donít do justice to what you will see in this film documentary. When you watch it you will be outraged, and you will no doubt ask the question we ask: Why isnít law enforcement doing something about these camps? Isnít there something that can be done?

Yes there is!

The first action I need you to take is to get ìHomegrown Jihadî from us TODAY. Use it to educate yourself, your family, your friends, elected officials you know ñ anyone you can think of.

And by getting the film you will help us take action. Hereís how.

* Become one of our monthly contributing Patriot Partners, make a monthly gift of $15 or more, and Iíll rush you the film. Simply <https://www.egsnetwork.com/gift/gift.php?giftid=7415AC7F-694D-417E-B372-126831E8EC2E>click here, fill out the safe and secure online form, select the ìmonthlyî gift in the ìfrequencyî box, and put in an amount of $15 or more.
Becoming a Patriotic Partner monthly contributor is the most effective way you can help us help you. This year, we want to put pressure on elected officials, from Congress down to city councils, to take the steps necessary to see that these camps are investigated and, hopefully, shut down.

Surely you would agree that $15 a month ñ just 50 cents a day ñ is a small price to pay for this.

We have the largest grassroots organization in America dedicated to combating the spread of radical Islam, and we will make our voice heard. We have allies in Congress who agree with us and share our concerns.

What we donít have ñ and what we need ñ is a lobbyist in Washington. An experienced

Comment: I would like to know what is going to be done about all of these illegal immigrants utilizing programs funded by legal tax paying citizens. It's unfair and something needs to be done. They get free benefits that they do not have a right to. All programs should be re-evaluated and we need to be able to report illegal immigrants so they can go through the proper channels to become legal citizens.

After several decades of the federal government turning a blind eye to our porous Southern border and their reluctance to enact real immigration reform the problem of illegal immigration now reaches every corner of our nation. Our porous Southern border has not only become a national security risk, with hundreds of thousands of undocumented foreigners pouring across our borders and Mexican drug wars spilling over onto U.S. soil, but it has also become an economic strain on our society.

Comment: $50,000 for gang prevention. You want to get rid of gangs? How about not giving the illegals the incentives to stay in NC? No more free health care-they are bankrupting our hospitals and clinics. If they want to go to public school here, they must pay as much as students that attend a private school. Don't think they don't have the money! Have you checked the amount being wire transferred back to Mexico and Latin America each weekend? They also receive food stamps. Which is why they can afford to send all that money back home. Please get tought on immigration...in this economy, it's time.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue; I would like to ask you what we are doing in NC to limit and eliminate the illegal immigrants from our workforce. I see people everyday that are in NC and working illegally. I do not understand how companys can hire undocumented or falsely documented workers when our own citizens are out of work. I have been hearing how the new construction projects are going to create so many jobs; how will your office help insure that these jobs will not go to illegal workers. The facts are clear that many employers are hiring illegals to save on wages, taxes and benefits expenses. These practices are not fair to the our citizens our economy nor to the employee. Can you tell me what your office is doing to fix this problem. Thank you for your time and service. Sincerely; Floyd Thomas Eden NC

Comment: Dear Gov. Purdue, Illegal Mexicans crossing the border are turning our cities, states, and country into a third world toilet, exporting their poverty and crime to America. Americans do not want any amnesty for aliens. What we do want is for our "esteemed" elected officials to secure our open borders, enforce current immigration laws, punish employers who hire these felons in the first place, cut ALL social services to illegals, begin some sort of mass deportation process back across the border to "Mehico," and END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, SANCTUARY CITIES, AND CHAIN MIGRATION. Taxpayers are sick and tired of footing the bill for these criminals and their token anchor babies.

Subject: New "work corner" for illegals looking for work in Chatham County

Comment: Amoco Station Ilegals March 16, 2009 Dear Sally Kost, Chatham County Commisioners, (Kay Hagan, Richard Burr, and David Price also contacted) At the corners of Hwy. 64 and Farrington Rd., at the Amoco gas station. there is a new "hang out spot" for (illegal) Hispanic men who are looking to find work. This is becoming obvious to several of us who live close by, and to contractors looking for cheap labor. It appears that many people are aware of the Commissioner's vote to not support ICE last month, and some are taking advantage of it. Last week my neighbor watched a guy load a whole truckload of Mexicans into his vehicle and drive away with them (to work). My neighbor is also in the construction business, but instead is hiring Americans who need a job. It is also quite obvious to others what is going on. I am contacting you first to make you aware, if you are not aware already. Secondly, I am contacting you to ask you to do something about this. It is quite a disgrace when we turn our heads, and our backs, to our fellow Americans who also desperately need work right now. Please do something about this. Thank you, Diane Borgman
