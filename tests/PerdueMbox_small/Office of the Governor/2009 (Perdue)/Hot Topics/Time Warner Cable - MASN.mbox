Governor Perdue:

I'm so sick of this.  I am considering switching back to TWC, but this kind of thing makes me want to stay away.  If you get this over with before the MLB 2009 opening day, I would make the call immediately.

I know both TWC and MASN's position.  Act like adults and stop stalling.  THe courts have said you need to carry this channel (and, hopefully, it's HD channel) immediately.  Now DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network.

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.  I have been a life long Orioles fan and I am more than willing to pay to watch them.  But Time Warner and MLB does not even give us that option.  There is no logical reason why the state of NC should be considered local to Baltimore.  Because of the blackout restrictions, I am not able to order mlb.tv or MLB ExtraInnings.  Something needs to change.  Either force Time Warner to play ball or remove us from the blackout restrictions and let the die hard fans pay to watch their favorite team.

Governor Perdue:

When is Time Warner Cable going to start carrying MASN?  My last cable bill was $25 higher than the previous one, but we're still unable to get this channel!!  There appears to be no good reason why they aren't carrying it.  And of course, the 2009 season is almost upon us, and my beloved Yankees are playing their opening 3 games against the Baltimore Orioles, and we won't be able to see any of those games unless we go to an establishment that has DirecTV!!  I don't understand why Time Warner Cable won't at least make MASN available in their MLB Extra Innings package which we subscribe to each year at a total cost of $169.

Please tell Time Warner cable in North Carolina to give the fans a break and start carrying MASN.
