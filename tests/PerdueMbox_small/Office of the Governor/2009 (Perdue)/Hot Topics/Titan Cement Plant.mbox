X-Folder: Titan Cement Plant


My name is Ian Oeschger. I am a resident of New Hanover County and I
strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth
largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate
moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of
this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public heath are
known.



Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country.
They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming
pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has
asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under
federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that
causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many
other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending
schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be
up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the
site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank
among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial
emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is
unacceptable.

I am especially concerned about mercury and my child's health

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State
Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any
project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public
health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air
permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this
major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.
I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA
rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an
'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is
unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this
plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do
everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop
this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium
on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Ian Oeschger

My name is Joel Bourne. I am a resident of New Hanover County and I
strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth
largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate
moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of

among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial
emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is

As a father of three young children, a recreational fisherman, a surfer,
and a small business owner in New Hanover County, I am very concerned
about the impacts of this plant on my family and my quality of life. I
could have moved my business to any community in the nation, yet I chose
Wilmington for its quality of life, and what I thought was its clean
environment. I did not move here for local cement. This industry is simply
incompatible with our coastal environment.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State
Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any

health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air

I am a small business owner in Wilmington, and I am furious to know that
my tax dollars are being used to court a heavy industry that stands to
reduce our quality of life, negatively impact the natural resources on
which our local fisheries and tourism depend and make this an all-around
less attractive place to live and work.  With input from taxpayers,
Wilmington and New Hanover County should consider using those dollars to
court low-impact / high technology industries to move their operations
here.  We have so much to offer those businesses, and I bet if we think
creatively, we can come up with a better way to use use those tax dollars
to grow our local economy by leveraging our our natural resources and
outstanding quality of life.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State

I am a mother of two small children, including one with asthma.  I want

quality are questionable and the fish are inedible due to mercury
contamination.

My family has lived in the region for over twelve years. We moved here
because of the many benefits of the community, and I would not choose to
live and raise my children in a community where heavily polluting
industries are allowed to operate. The citizens deserve a thorough and
comprehensive evaluation of Titan's proposal, which will only be assured
if we have the time afforded by a moratorium, and the establishment of an
unbiased legislative study commission. I urge you to support these
actions.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State

X-Folder: Titan Cement Plant


My name is Dana Larkin. I am a resident of New Hanover County and I
strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth
largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate
moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of
this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are
known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country.
They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming
pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has
asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under
federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that
causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many
other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending
schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be
up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the
site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank
among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial
emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is
unacceptable.

I am a mother of 2 boys who will be attending the new school in Castle
Hayne. This school is less than 2 miles from the proposed site, and I am
concerned about the health risks. Also, when my husband and I moved to the
east coast from California, we could have chosen any area, but chose
Wilmington for its natural resources so we could enjoy them with our sons.
We all enjoy boating, swimming, fishing, and kayaking, and it's hard to
watch an industry such as Titan being invited here to ruin those
resources.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State
Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any
project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public
health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air
permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this
major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.
I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA
rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an
'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is
unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this
plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do
everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop
this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium
on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Dana Larkin

My name is Bob Cockman. I am a resident of Pender County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.

I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My name is Cindy Yates. I am a resident of New Hanover County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

We live in paradise which has been proven by the influx of people moving into our area. I live about 4 miles from the proposed Titan site and believe me I'll be happy to sell you my house at any time. I have 2 grandchildren who I do not wish to expose to inhalation of particulate matter and ingestion of mercury. This is not the type of business we need in our beautiful delicate area.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they may be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

I am a small business person with family in NHC for 30 years, swimming, sailing, fishing and living on the water.  We cannot let this short term job stimulus blind us to the fact that once the plant closes and it will, we will be stuck with a vast amount of environmental damage that will be cost prohibitive to clean up.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

I am extremely worried about the effects of Titan Cement Plant, I live in Wilmington NC because I enjoy kayaking, fishing, and surfing in the beautiful waters of Carolina Beach, Kure Beach and Wrightsville Beach, also in all the intracoastal waterways.  I also have a one year old and worry about the effects of increase mercury in the environment. I am a small business owner and hope that you take all of our concerns very seriously.

Hello, I am a mother of two boys that are very active in recycling and reusing items instead of throwing them in the trash.  We Work very hard at using items that are safe for our environment.  Please stop the Titam Cement Plant from coming to our area.  We have beautiful land, water and sky to protect.  Please keep it clean for my children to enjoy for years to come.

Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I have one child that is scheduled to attend one of the schools in the proposed area and one on the way and due in June.  I am also a small business owner who is very concerned about the effects of pollutants on our health, children, unborn children and economy.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My name is Lisa Crowell. I am a resident of Pender County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I am a mother of two and am very concerned about the environment.  I am also a member of  PenderWatch and have been a participant of the roadside clean-ups in Hampstead. I am now heading up the next roadside clean-up.  I am also co-coordinating a beach clean-up and an oyster shell recycling bagging project with a group of visiting college students in March.  We moved here a year ago, and we are very concerned about keeping the environment safe for the citizens of the area and with protecting the environment for the flora and fauna that live here.  Wetlands should be protected since they cannot be replaced.  Having a cement plant here in this area would be very hazardous to the health of so many, not to mention the very likely negative effect on tourism to our area.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they may be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Hello elected reps of Wilmington. I'm Alexandra P. and I'm e-mailing you asking to consider all the pollution that will be caused by the TITAN pollutants. I would like to imform you that I am currently 12 years old, and even I think this is unacceptable! Why would you put about 8000 students at risk to these horrible illnesses? I'd just like to say my mind. But seriously. Why? That's all I'm asking.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.

I am a father of three girls and believe that the health of my family and of all families in eastern and central NC is more important than the economic gains proposed by this project. Please say "no" and find another way to increase jobs and the tax base in New Hanover County.

I am a local business owner who relies on the local water environment for personal recreation, personal lifestyle, and for my business customers.

Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I'm a mother of two young children who would most likely be districted to what my friends and I are calling the "Titan School". Fortunately, I will have the ability to opt out of the public system and send them to private school, which I will absolutely do. There's no chance I would allow my kids to attend school near this plant. But I'm dismayed at the thought of all the families who won't have a choice due to economic circumstances, and will be forced to either move, if they can swing it, or knowingly expose their children to neurotoxic waste. Please don't put your constituents in that horrible position!

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they may be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Elizabeth Evans

My name is Ian Oeschger. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

I am a mother of two and i assure you we will consider moving if this plant is built as will many people with young children.

I am simply an old lifetime resident of Wilmington, as were my parents and grandparents, and I treasure the wide area, its people, its beauty, its way of life, its history, despite lamentable periods.  Please do all you can to stop Titan and future efforts of this kind.I should like to mention that Sims Hugo Neu, as far as I know, still owns the area near Navassa, an area that is still zoned in its favor.  That, too, still presents a problem for this wide area. Thank you for all efforts you have already made to keep the Wilmington area and surroundings safe and please be good enough to continue to combat this present threat.  Margaret L. Rorison

My name is Trey Schmit. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

PLEASE DONT LET THIS HAPPEN FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.  PLEASE DON'T SELL US OUT!

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they may be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Trey Schmit

Years ago I worked for a company that provided services to Southwest Portland Cement in El Paso, Texas.   I can assure you that the process of creating cement is dirty and creates massive amounts of dust and chemical pollution. Even worse, Titan will be mining an ecologically irreplaceable wetlands area and could possibly endanger the underlying water aquifer.  Please, be responsive to the inhabitants of this county and North Carolina and stop this plant from locating here.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

My name is Jerome Friar. I am a resident of Pender County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

The environmental risks regarding Titan's mercury emissions is reason enough to keep this industry out of our state.  Wilmington already has industry which emit mercury as a byproduct.  This has been scientifically proven.  Our ecosystem in SE North Carolina is fragile and we must search out companies which will complement those concerns.  Titan make absolutely no logical sense.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they may be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Jerome Friar

My name is Jack Anderson-. I am a resident of New Hanover County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

We are a retired couple who came here to enjoy the fresh sea air and healthful climate.  What are you thinking?  NO to Titan.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.
