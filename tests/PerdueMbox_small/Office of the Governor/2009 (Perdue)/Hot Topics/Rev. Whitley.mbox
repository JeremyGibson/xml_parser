Comment: I hope you realize one little simple truth.The second amendment guarantees us all the right to keep and bear arms.It is also covers everything and anything associated with our individual rights as usa citizens.I have noticed that Mr. Whitley is trying to circumvent the 2nd amendment by trying to get legislation passed that would require anyone wanting to purchase ammunition for our legally obtained firearms,to get a permit to buy the ammunition.We already have to have either a permit from the sheriff's dept. or a right to carry permit to even purchase a firearm as it is,let alone require us to have one to buy the ammunition!How many permits are we supposed to have?It is bad enough that the "obama" administration is waiting serial numbers on all ammunition and ban any that's not including reloaded ammunition!If you happen to see any legislation from the misguided reverend whitley,please inform him that his legislation is totally and utterly against the constitution and is even illegal to bring into legislation because of the heller vs. dc lawsuit,the 2nd amendment,and the fact the american people will not stand for it.It is bad enough out 2nd amendment rights are going to under go a series of attacks under the "obama" administration while "he" tries to get rid of it altogether!Just inform the "not too good" reverend that he needs to go back to church and stay there!Leave the law and the 2nd amendment alone!Thank you for your time.

Hello, My name is Rick Ward.  I live in Manns Harbor, NC 27953.  My email is <mailto:rtwdaw@hotmail.com>rtwdaw@hotmail.com.  I have an urgent concern.  It is that anti-gun activist Reverend Melvin Whitley has been promoting a "Bullet Ownership Bill," which would require anyone who wishes to purchase ammunition to first acquire a permit.  I believe it flies in the face of our founding fathers and would make a laughing stalk of this state on national news.  Please help.  Thank you,  Rick Ward

Comment: Gov. Perdue ... Rev. M. Whitney is attempting an end run around the USSC Heller ruling by having the Durham City Council push a"Bullet Ownership Bill" in the state legistlature, a bill requiring permits to by ammunition. I strongly ask you to do all in your power to stop this attack on a law abiding citizen's 2nd Amendment rights. Thank You. T.F.Eaton

Comment: This e-mail is to inform you that citizens in North Carolina do not support any legislation to limit the sale of ammunition to law abiding citizens as protected under the Second amendment. Further, we do not support the use of funds other than to create eco-friendly jobs with transparency of funding to show how each dollar is spent and the job(s) that were created. Best wishes in your new job. Sincerely, Janice Putnam, UNC Class of 81 and 83

Subject: Possible Durham Proposal

Comment: I sent the following email to all of the Durham city Council regarding Rev. Whitley's proposed permit to buy ammunition proposal. Should this, or any similar proposal come before you, I strongly urge you to vote against it. Thanks, and please let em know how you plan to vote on such bills. Richard Chiaramonte r.chiaram@verizon.net Bahama, NC 27503 Dear Durham City Council, I am writing today to strongly urge you to reject Reverend Melvin Whitley attempt to add further restrictions on the rights of law-abiding citizens. Asking all law abiding citizens to pay for the few law breaking citizens that abuse their rights is always the wrong direction to take. As you know Rev. Whitley proposal would require anyone who purchases ammunition to first acquire a permit. This would add greatly to the workload and expense of the police department, not to mention adding an unreasonable expense to every purchase. In addition, does the Reverend, or you, really think that anyone intent on committing a crime, would go through the effort to get a permit for anything, especially ammunition! You may also be aware of the recent Supreme Court's Heller decision, affirming that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. Just as law-abiding citizens have the right to own firearms, they have the right to own the ammunition for those arms. I strongly urge you to reject this proposal, and any proposals that infringe on the rights of honest citizens. Please let me know how you plan to vote on this issue. Thanks, Sincerely, Richard Chiaramonte r.chiaram@verizon.net Bahama, NC
