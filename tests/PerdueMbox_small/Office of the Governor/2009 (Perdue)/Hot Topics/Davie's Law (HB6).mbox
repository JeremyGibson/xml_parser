Subject: HB 6--Davie's Law

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: I am a former resident of your beautiful state and my daughter still lives in the Princeton area. I did three years' volunteer work at the Clayton, NC animal shelter (Johnston Cty SPCA) and really appreciate anything you can do to help this bill become a law. Before my friend, Melinda Barefoot, established the Johnston County SPCA, the police officers of Clayton would tie dogs to a tree and shot them. Your help is GREATLY appreciated! Cheryl

Comment: I would respectfully ask that you support Davie's law. These poor animals should never have to die under the horrendous conditions of the gas chamber. We as a people should heed Ghandi's words. A nation can be defined by the way it treats it's animals. Thank you for alowing me to present my views.

Subject: H.B. 6, Davie's Bill

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I strongly urge you to support H.B. 6, known as Davieâ€™s Law, which has been filed in the North Carolina House. Davie's Law is named for Davie, a puppy who survived a North Carolina gas chamber. He was found in the trash after he was gassed at a shelter. Davie's Law would require the removal of all gas chambers from North Carolina shelters. The bill would mandate euthanasia by lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital or an equivalent, or oral ingestion of the drug, for all shelter animals. The law would also ban injection through the heart, a cruel and painful procedure known as a "heartstick." Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina currently euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively. Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals. In the 32 county and city shelters that still use gas chambers, some use commercially manufactured units, while others are crudely built units constructed of cinderblock, metal, and wood. A recent study from the American Humane Association by national animal care and control consultant Doug Fakkema shows that euthanasia by injection is less expensive than the gassing in every scenario. This study was based on recent figures obtained from North Carolina animal shelters. Please support this important bill!

Davies Law would require the removal of all gas chambers for North Carolina shelters. These chambers are cruel and should be outlawed. The animals do not have a voice and are relying on us.

Comment: I am writing to urge you to support the .B. 6, known as Davie's Law. Millions of helpless animals have to be euthanized yearly. This is a very sad and unfortunate reality; please make their suffering less and ban all gassing of animals. I have faith that you were elected by the people because we the people feel you will do the right thing...though euthanizing unwanted animals is not the answer to this issue. I hope with you will try to make extra efforts to make people understand the importance of adoption and spay and neutering pet so the issue of over population is lessened. Thank you for your time and taking action in this matter.

Subject: Please support H.B.6/Davie's Law

Comment: We are writing you today as our North Carolina Governor to ask you to please support H.B.6, known as Davie's Law. Davie's Law is named for Davie, a puppy who survived a North Carolina gas chamber. He was found in the trash after he was gassed at a shelter. The bill is endorsed by In Defense of Animals, American Humane Association, Animal Law Coaliton, Born Free USA, and the North Carolina Coalition for Humane Euthanasia, as well as many local veterinarians and animal welfare organizations. Rep. Cary Allred is the primary sponsor along with Reps. Rick Glazier (District 45), Ty Harrell (District 41) and Pat McElraft (District 13). Davie's Law would require the removal of all gas chambers from North Carolina shelters. The bill would mandate euthanasia by lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital or an equivalent, or oral ingestion of the drug, for all shelter animals. The law would also ban injection thru the heart, a cruel and painful procedure known as a "heartstick." Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina currently euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively.

A recent study from the American Humane Association by national Animal Care and Control Consultant Doug Fakkema shows that euthanasia by injection is less expensive than the gassing in every scenario. This study was based on recent figures obtained from North Carolina animal shelters. Although we would dearly love for all animals to be saved because NC is totally dedicated to no-kill shelters, because that isn't currently happening, please help animals who must be euthanized to receive the most humane treatment possible. Thank you from animal lovers & all the animals we speak for. Blessings to you - Scott & Sherry Bell ^..^ 622 N. Elm St., Eden, NC 27288

I am writing today to ask that you give your full support for H.B. 6 also known as Davie’s Law.



It is long past time that North Carolina prohibits the barbaric practice of gassing its unwanted animals.  As you know, gassing is not always effective and there are far more humane methods to handle this situation.



Please support this critical piece of legislation for the animals and for your constituents.



Thank you.

Comment: I am not an over zealous animal rights activist. I am just an average pet lover who believes that the sheer number of unwanted and unloved animals in our country is heartbreaking. The very least we can do is humanely euthanize them-it may be the only opportunity they ever have to be treated humanely. Thanks Mary

Comment: I am writing to urge you to support this bill ending the euthanasia of animals by gassing. It is horribly cruel and if an animal has to be euthanized due to humans being irresponsible and letting breeding get out of control, then it should be done in the most humane way possible. Gas chambers are cruel and outdated and the animals have suffered long enough. Thank you. Sincerely, Candice Garrett

Davie's Law/ Humane Euthanasia in Shelters (House Bill #6) was filed Wednesday, January 28 in the North Carolina General Assembly by Representative Cary Allred.  The bill is named for a<http://www.freewebs.com/ncche/Davie20.jpg> puppy who survived a North Carolina gas chamber, later to be found in alive a plastic bag in a dumpster by a citizen taking out her trash.  Many shelters still use the CO gas chamber and other cruel and inhumane methods to end the lives of lost and abandoned animals.  If Davie's Law passes, it would ensure that no animal would ever again be subjected to this treatment in a North Carolina shelter. 

The bill is endorsed by the American Humane Association, Animal Law Coalition, In Defense of Animals, Born Free USA, and many veterinarians and animal welfare organizations.  It would require humane euthanasia by injection of sodium pentobarbital, or an alternate oral version of the drug, for all animals euthanized in the custody of shelters.  Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively.  Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals.  Still, thirty-two county and city shelters kill animals in gas chambers made of cinderblock, metal, and even wood.   

House Bill #6 can be found at this link <http://ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=H6>http://ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2009&BillID=H6.  Other primary sponsors include Representatives Rick Glazier, Ty Harrell, and Pat McElraft. 

Thanks for your support for humane euthanasia in North Carolina!  For more information,  please contact North Carolina Coalition for Humane Ethanasia  <http://ncche.com/>http://ncche.com/, <mailto:nccoalition@yahoo.com>nccoalition@yahoo.com

"To a man whose mind is free there is something even more intolerable in the sufferings of animals than in the sufferings of man. For with the latter it is at least admitted that suffering is evil and that the man who causes it is a criminal. But thousands of animals are uselessly butchered every day without a shadow of remorse. If any man were to refer to it, he would be thought ridiculous. And that is the unpardonable crime."  Romain Rolland, author, Nobel Prize 1915

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Ms. eileen smith

Address: 1 rifle court, barnegat, NJ 08005

Email: whiterose@whiterosepath.com

Subject: H.B. 6/S.B. 199.

Comment: Dear Honorable Madam, I urge your support of Davie's Law, H.B. 6/S.B. 199. Davie's Law is named for Davie, a puppy pictured here, http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-chambers/article/572 who survived a North Carolina gas chamber. He was found in the trash after he was gassed at a shelter. Read the bill here. Rep. Cary Allred is the primary sponsor along with Reps. Rick Glazier (District 45), Ty Harrell (District 41) and Pat McElraft (District 13). The bill would mandate euthanasia by lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital or an equivalent, or oral ingestion of the drug, for all shelter animals. The law would ban injection, however, thru the heart, a cruel and painful procedure known as heartstick. Davie's Law would require the removal of all gas chambers from North Carolina shelters. Sixty-five animal shelters in North Carolina currently euthanize primarily by injection, and fifty-nine of those report using this method exclusively. Employees in those shelters have been trained to safely deal with wildlife and aggressive animals. In the 32 county and city shelters that still use gas chambers, some use commercially manufactured units, while others are crudely built units constructed of cinderblock, metal, and wood. A recent study from the American Humane Association by national Animal Care and Control Consultant, Doug Fakkema, shows that euthanasia by injection is less expensive than the gassing in every scenario. This study is attached to this article as a download and was based on recent figures obtained from North Carolina animal shelters. Thank you for your time, Eileen Smith

Subject: Davie's Law

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Please support Davie's law for humane euthanasia for shelter animals. As the proud "mom" of three stray animals in my lifetime, I cannot tell you what having them in my life has done for my sense of self and those around me. I was able to end my beloved Sula Dog's life with dignity and grace and want the same for those animals who are not fortunate enough to find loving homes. Please support this H.B. 6/S.B. 199. thank you for your time and consideration. I remain grateful for your service to this, my mother's home state! SP Holland

Comment: Please support S,B 199 Davie's Law to the fullest. As someone who battles for animal rights on a constant basis I know that this is a much needed law. Cruelty of all forms should not have to be endured by animals, they have feelings too, God created them before he did man, perhaps they are his preference. I don't wish to stand before my Creator one day and try to explain why I did not do my part, would you. Respectfully Elizabeth

Subject: Davie's Law proposed Bill

Comment: I am writing this email to voice my opinion on methods used to put down animals. The CO2 gas chambers need to be banned ASAP and a more humane way put in place. The CO2 chambers do not always kill the animals and the ones that do pass die a horrible death. I know first hand the horrible effects CO2 has on individuals as my wife took her own life using same method. I was the one who found her and can tell you its not a pretty, painless way to go. Animals give unconditional love and subjecting them to this cruel death is beyond inhumane. I realize there would be more costs associated with more humane methods, but giving the animals a peaceful passing when there lives have been anything such, is the right thing to do. Please stand behind this Bill and show compassion, just like animal's do for us! After all its not the animals fault, irresponsible people are the reason for the overabundant pet population. If another Bill was passed requiring neuter/spay programs, banning of puppy mills, and insurance requirements for aggressive breeds... the need for such mass terminations would decrease dramatically. I appreciate you time and action on this matter!

My daughter is doing a graduation project on the humane treatment of animals and through her work we found out about the horrific way animals are being treated in some of our state's shelters. In researching the issue more I found that you have been a supporter of humane euthanasia. I'd just like to thank you. Also...off topic...I'm a training coordinator for biotechnology in our community college system...thanks for your push to make NC #1 in biotech manufacturing. Julie Kinlaw

Comment: I voted for Bev Perdue and I would like to know how she will assure that Davie's Law will pass to end all gas chambers in North Carolina, including the Craven-Pamlico Animal Shelter. There is a lack of adoption programs for these animals and Craven County killed 306% more animals per human resident thatn any other shelter in the nation!!! Is she going to make needless animal suffering stop? I would like to know that my vote went to a woman of action and a good heart to help these defenseless animals. Thank you.

Subject: Davie's Law H.B. 6

Comment: I am writing to ask that you please do everything in your power to push the Davie's Law H.B. 6 bill through. It is morally unacceptable and inhumane to have animals at shelters killed in such a horrific way with the gas chamber method. Because the gas chamber method is so ineffective, some of these poor suffering animals are often placed in trash bags while still alive then thrown into dumpsters and landfills to die slowly of suffocation There is nothing humane about this. There is no doubt that there is overcrowding in our shelters for many reasons and some animals cannot be placed and unfortunately must be euthanized. But the reasons for this overcrowding can be traced back directly to humans! If every person that took on the responsibility of a pet would have that animal neutered or spayed ,the number of stray and unwanted animals would drastically decrease. The animals that end up in shelters because humans refuse to take responsibility for their well being should at least be afforded a painless and humane euthanasia. As you probably know euthanasia means "good death". Their is nothing good about dying in a gas chamber and being left for dead in a dumpster. As humans the least we can do for the animals we abandon is give them a good death. Please see that the gas chambers are deemed inhumane in our great state of North Carolina. Thank you for hearing my plea. Sincerely, Carol Orr 138 E. Knollbrook Dr. Mocksville,NC 27028 336-749-4390

Comment: I understand that a bill has been introduced to ban gas chamber's from being used to destroy unwanted animals. I hope that you will be supporting this bill. North Carolina needs to move to a more enlightened approach to animal cruelty/welfare. I would think that you would be outraged and try to make it stop. I do understand that there is a terrible problem with over population and that for that reason, euthanization is the best approach. However, imagine what those animals go through, all cats in the gas chamber at one time, or all dogs. Clawing, scratching, hurting each other. Scared out of their wits while oxygen is being sucked out of them. The lucky ones are the ones that die first (usually the ones on top). Those that are underneath the other animals die an even slower and more horrifying death. Then, there are the ones that are just unconscious and thrown in trash bags to be carried to the dump. It is very rare they are as lucky as Davie was. These animals didn't ask to be brought into this world. For whatever reason, they ended up at a shelter and end their days there. The least we can do is to make their last moments peaceful rather than terrifying. Thank you for you time, Elizabeth Talton
