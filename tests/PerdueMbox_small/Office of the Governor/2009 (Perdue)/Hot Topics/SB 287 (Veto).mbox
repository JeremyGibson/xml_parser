Sen. Rand,


In general, but especially in the current economic climate, North Carolina state government should be on the forefront of enacting and enforcing cost-efficient and cost-saving policies in its facilities. By simply enacting power-saving policies like expecting state government employees to set computer CPUs and monitors to power-saving modes when out of use can save up to 80% on the cost of electricity across all government offices (<http://pmdb.cadmusdev.com/powermanagement/quickCalc.html>http://pmdb.cadmusdev.com/powermanagement/quickCalc.html and <http://www.epa.gov/epahome/workplac.htm>http://www.epa.gov/epahome/workplac.htm). Requiring that employees power down unnecessary office equipment at the end of the workday, including CPUs, monitors, speakers, printers, and copiers, improves reductions in energy costs. State employees should also be encouraged to make a better effort to turn off the lights in empty offices, conference rooms, and storage rooms.


In addition, better policies and enforcement of existing and new policies for using and purchasing office supplies should be considered. I often hear stories from classroom teachers who have severely limited classroom supplies and who go to every extreme to recycle whatever material is available to them in order to use in their classrooms. State government as a†whole would be well-served to take a lesson from those resourceful teachers. Many administrative assistants already serve in the capacity of purchasing agentsí for their officeís supply needs. Perhaps they should be empowered to more strictly monitor the use of supplies. Leadership might also consider providing each office with a yearly allotment that once depleted cannot be replenished in that fiscal year.


As a state employee speaking on behalf of many of my colleagues, we want to work with Governor Perdue and the General Assembly to identify cost-cutting measures that are immediate and relatively simple to implement. It is discouraging to think that simple cost-saving measures are being overlooked while dramatic changes such as reductions in state employee health benefits are being touted as a primary solution to the stateís budget shortfall. State government employees are already plagued with low morale and often are not highly regarded by the general public. Combine that with hiring freezes, salary freezes, and potential layoffs, the work environment in state government offices is toxic and reducing one of the major benefits of being a state employee creates an increasingly negative outlook from within our own ranks. This negativity and the anxiety created by the unknown results in even more loss in employee productivity. These options will save money and have the added benefit of bringing North Carolina closer to its ideals of becoming a more energy-efficient and environmentally-conscious state.


Thank you for your consideration,

Melinda A. Taylor

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I have just recently been made aware of and have looked up the bill sponsored by Tony Rand (State Senate Bill 287) to change state employee benefits. This is an outrage. After all the American people have been asked to do to bail out those who have corrupted our economy, for the state to then turn around and cut our benefits is completely unacceptable. We have given enough, keep this state going and have frankly had it. I urge you to Veto this bill and help the people that have put you in office to keep one of the few things we have left, our health care benefits. Sincerely, Larry Bass 57 Squirrel Ridge Marion, NC 28752 lsb61@verizon.net

Comment: I am writing this in opposition to Senate Bill 287. I feel that this bill will have a very negative impact on our state. If state employees were forced to mail order perscriptions we as a state would be losing jobs to other states. I feel this is the exact opposite direction we should be moving as a state. We should be creating jobs and not creating more unemployment. Please help us save North Carolina jobs and independent pharmacies. Thank You.

Email: sapstersister@yahoo.com

Subject: Senate Bill 287 - Vote No!

Comment: Tell your lawmaker to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù to Senate Bill 287! Some of the benefit reductions in SB 287 include: -Increasing the member-only annual deductible to $800 -Eliminating the 90/10 PPO option, routine eye exams, exams for hearing aid prescriptions, fitting and the device -Moving smokers to the 70/30 option effective July 1, 2010 -Moving overweight participants with a Body Mass Index (BMI) higher than 40 to the 70/30 option effective July 1, 2011 My name is Monique Millsap and I live at 902 Navaho Drive Apt 102 Raleigh, NC 27609. I don't agree completely with this bill because it is discriminatory and does not resolve underlying problems. What about those with conditions like anorexia and bulimia or thin people with high cholesterol and blood pressure? I would fit into the category of special people who can get their doctor to write the plan to get a choice, but many people can't. I challenge you to realize what it is like to try to do all on the salary that we get. What would you do if you only got $1500 per month and had to provide for your family? I really believe that the fact that Mr. Rand makes way more in salary and can go month to month without choosing which bill to pay gives him a blind eye to all that the impact of this bill would mean for our state. Yes, it provides some options for moving North Carolinians to a healthier life but never takes into account the difficulties one has to go through to achieve it. Simple is what all the messages portray to have a healthy lifestyle, but nobody looks at the choices that have to be sacrificed to maintain it. Many people get excited about starting something but it is the month to month maintenance that really determines if they can make it through. Doctors give advice and coalitions are formed to eat according to the pyramids or stop smoking, but the programs that are required to be paid for to achieve those goals are not reachable. How about I get the offer that my health insurance paid for Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, medically supervised exercise programs? I look at these things and some parts are covered by insurance with permission but the copay is the clincher. Imagine trying to pay $25, $50, $75 each visit that it takes to participate in the medically supervised exercise. For overweight people, that is 3 - 5 times per week to hit the goal weight. Add a nutritionist to that and that is another $40 copay for a specialist. Where do you get the money to lose the weight? That's just the program. Did you realize it costs to eat healthy? It cost me when I have tried before about $100 per week for me alone. Let's add two kids. Who has that kind of money on $1500 per month? This is your average state employee. Let's face it, the average take home salary is between $1200 and $2000 per month. My specific issue is also with the overweight category. Yes I am overweight. Yes I have tried many things to correct that. However, as a Type II diabetic, it is difficult to do so because it is just generally harder to control your weight due to the ups and downs of the condition. It is depressing to go through. Compile that with being allergic to Iodine and Povidone. I cannot take any of the best prescribed medicines for diabetes nor eat many of the lower carbohydrate vegetables because when I do, I have to go to the hospital for allergic reactions or worse, an asthma attack. Now it comes down to choice with the conditions....pay for medication to maintain them or choose the ones that will keep you alive. If I had to choose between weight and asthma/allergies, I would have to choose the latter. I was for the first time in my life after maintaining these conditions, hospitalized for an asthma attack at age 37. If I died, my kids who face their own challenges would not have me. I put first their need to eat healthy over mine. That means that I pay $111 per month just for school breakfast and lunch. It is a family of 3. When you only have $50 left to buy groceries for the month, how do you control your weight? Now as a result of the hospitalization, medical bills are in the thousands and let me explain that the majority of them have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH WEIGHT! I have never gone to the Emergency Room for my weight or my diabetes. I have mainly gone for my asthma and my allergies. The thought of one more $100 copay had me calling my doctor so that I could pay $20 in October. However, thanks to a good friend who told the doctor she heard rattling in my chest and a short stay in the hospital, I can write this request to you today. Now let's add to the $161 in food per month, the $350 for prescriptions. How about I have 7 prescriptions for asthma and allergies and only 1 for my diabetes. I have obstructive sleep apnea and have to sleep with a machine and oxygen to stay alive and ward off migraines which I was hospitalized for also. I take aspirin for a heart condition that 25% of the population has and only 2 for blood pressure. I pay $4 per month for blood pressure pills and buy whatever else I can over the counter. I just feel that you need to take a closer look at the bill in light of most of the state employees and really think about how this short term solution to a budget deficit is going to long-term negatively impact your state workers and teachers. If they can't afford to control these two issues of weight and smoking, now, then how do you expect them to afford them after you take away coverage? How does that impact our children? Sincerely, Monique Millsap

Dear Governor Perdue,

†††† Let me begin by saying that in the recent election I voted for you because you†were supposed to be in support of North Carolina pharmacies.† I hope that we, NC pharmacy employees, can still look to you for support with our problems.††North Carolina Senator Tony Rand has presented a bill that will be devastating to†many pharmacies if it is passed the way written.† Our pharmacies rely on the business brought to us by the State Teachers and Employees.† ††
†††† I am a pharmacy technician in Randleman North Carolina.† I have worked in pharmacy for ten years, and this job is my livelihood.† I feel that the NC Senate is targeting all pharmacies in North Carolina with the proposed bill SB-287.† If this bill is passed it will be detrimental to not only independent pharmacies but chain pharmacies as well.† State Teachers and Employees are a major portion of our business.† If we lose them as customers many pharmacies will be put out of business, and the unemployment rate in North Carolina will continue to increase.† An estimated 5400 jobs will be lost in NC if this bill is passed the way it is written now.† MEDCO HEALTH is a large company that has presented Sen. Rand with a proposal that seems too good to be true.† But lets look at the facts:† Medco does not care about NC's problems. Medco has shorted the federal government around 150 million dollars.† Medco has their own repackaging plants which means they can set their own AWP.†
†††† Please tell me how sending a major portion of North Carolina's health care to other states is going to be beneficial to North Carolina.† New alternatives need to be researched.† Have we even considered the fact that a major problem in North Carolina is the Medicaid system.† NOT STATE TEACHERS AND EMPLOYEES!!!!!† Maybe instead of hurting pharmacies by withholding our business, we could take a closer look at the major problems with Medicaid.† Medicaid is abused everyday by people who know how to play the system to benefit themselves.† It is a shame that the NC Medicaid system is in such horrible shape that people who really need help are looked down upon because others take advantage of the system.† The state's insurance program is not the major problem.† There are many alternatives other than this that can be looked at.† Please consider keeping State Teachers and Employees business in North Carolina with local pharmacies.† Our state cannot afford to lose more jobs and businesses to other states.†

†††As a community of pharmacy employees we ask you for your support in helping us keep business in North Carolina.† I think we†all believe†the only way to help North Carolina is to develop new ways to help the businesses that are already here.†

Thank you for your time

Candice Williams

Subject: senate bill 287

Comment: I have been a teacher in Alleghany County and NCAE member for 15 years. My wife is a pharmacist at one of the two local drug stores in our small, rural town. I am extremely concerned about the pharmacy plan portion of Senate Bill 287. It appears this plan could force state employees to order their prescriptions through the mail, possibly from another state. This could cause serious economic harm to Alleghany County and in my opinion, the entire state. I understand the budget dilema, but taking more jobs and tax dollars out of N.C. makes no sense at all. In our community everyone knows everyone else, and my wife has gone into the pharmacy many times, late and after hours to help out a member of the community with a needed prescription. Will the mail order pharmacists do the same? I see know positives with this for state employees or local business. I am proud to say that I voted for N.C.'s first female Governor, please Governor Pardue, don't let me, my wife and our three wonderful children down. Stop or change this bill.

Subject: Bill SB 287 (State Employee Health Care) PLEASE HELP!

Comment: Dear Gov. Purdue Hello, My name is Michael Garrison. I live in Burlington as does my fiance' who is a state employee as well. She teaches autistic children in Guilford County. The issue at hand is the bill SB 287. It would do the state employees a great injustice to have this passed bc the proposals are just insane (for lack of better terms). Please read. "SB 287, sponsored by Rand, drastically cuts benefits and increases out-of-pocket costs, including: ‚Ä¢ Doubling the annual deductible for employees on the standard plan (80/20) ‚Ä¢ Eliminating the 90/10 PPO, routine eye exams and exams for hearing aid prescriptions, fittings and the device ‚Ä¢ Moving smokers to the 70/30 PPO effective July 1, 2010 ‚Ä¢ Moving overweight participants with a Body Mass Index higher than 40 to the 70/30 option effective July 1, 2011" Not only do we face "furloughs" (bc I am a UNC employee) which will cut down on my income, we now have to worry about the doubling of our annual deductable??? I do not get it. BCBS, a non profit, administers our plan and they (according to recent media reports) made a PROFIT of 186 MILLION dollars last year. The BCBS's CEO made 4 MILLION dollars last year and thats a 23% raise!! Something smells fishy here. They made an extreme profit for a non profit organization to begin with and now they are asking to double our deductables? That amounts to around $700.00 a year!! We cannot afford this. I cannot afford this and neither can my soon to be wife. We plan on having children in the near future as well. How are we to be healthy by visiting our Dr's if we cannot afford it? How can we take care of our children medically if the cost doubles and our benefits decrease?? It saddens us greatly that SOME of our own representatives do not look after their constituents. There are many other ways to drive down these costs but due to the now repealed law the BCBS contracts are now private. Taxpayers are now not allowed to have access to these contracts to see if any cost-savings measures can be found. This is another injustice to the taxpayers of this great state. We as taxpayers should not be left in the dark! We will remember this come next election year! I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Please toss this sorry no good crooked bill out. Regards Mike Garrison

I am not happy with your proposed budget and it's effect on state employees .If you freeze our longevity pay what are you going to take away from the other state employees that don't get longevity ?.....Why penalize your career employees who have given 10,15,20 plus years of service to North Carolina ...this is not fair .....those of us that are in the $32,000 and below range also can not afford a cut in salary either or have our health benefits suffer. I am also concerned about shutting down the prisons and moving prisoners to also overcrowded prisons only to not have sufficient personnel to guard them.....there has to be a better way....

Comment: Gov. Perdue, If I remember correctly the state of NC SEANC endorsed you for Gov. It looks as if you are making some terrible choices. If this bill passes, NC can proudly say they are 50th in health care spending per plan member. Shame on you. It is also a shame to recommend taking away longevity pay, that is about the only benefit left for NC employees, soon they will have nothing , no benefits at all. I voted for you for Gov. and I sure hope you don't make me sick of that. You sure sounded like you were for state employees before and now it looks totally opposite. Why don't you do something most politicians never accomplish,,,, stick to your word, look our for state employees and make our state a proud place to work as it has always been , up until the recent past.

The Honorable Govenor of North Carolina, Ms.†B. Purdue†

As a teacher in the state of NC, I learned today about the proposed (and almost -very quickly and questionably- adopted bill) to change the state health plan.† I and, I'm sure, thousands†of†teachers were stunned by much of what we read.†† It is not that we do not understand the severity of the†recession†in†our economy and its effects across our state, but that there are multiple objections about many parts of the bill and that the bill was to be passed with little note or awareness to the members affected by its changes.

These points are just a few of the†issues that are very objectionalble:† (And are only the highlights of the objections - I and others like me - realize there are a vast number of points and explanations to justify these measures made by the state, but†many of the†basic premises that are proposed in this bill, are in essence wrong.
* If one is overweight or obese, they will be put on the 70/30 plan, if they fail to overcome this problem. † This is discriminatory and†I believe unconstitutional.†I am over 55 years old - I have gained weight as I've aged, but I am healthy, and not obese.
* †How many congressmen are overweight?† What types of health plans do congressmen have?†How many people weigh as much as they did when they were 25 or 30?†
* Smoking - while I do not smoke - this state†with one hand produces tobacco and on the other hand wants to penalize its teachers & family†members†for using a product that is part of its economy.
* The plan†currently does not pay anything to help a person lose weight, or quit smoking, and now will take away eye exams and other important diagnostic tests or make its members pay more, but it wants its teachers to be in top form to teach, on a salary that†cannot support a family with one paycheck, especially now that the cost of the plan will rise.
* Now employees will pay part of the†cost of their insurance plan out of paycheck deductions†and increase the cost for coverage for†children and spouses.†So, in essence, expect them to pay for†a plan they may not have a choice about;††pay for extra costs to achieve the plan's goals for the members; increase co-pays, perscription charges, deductables, eye exams, specialists, and much more†that may be essential, ALL ON A SALARY THAT†DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO†SUPPORT A FAMILY NOW, (espcially one parent homes) and†can't receive any raises because of the economy. †
* Education wants to attract young, well-educated teachers and keep them this way?
* It seems that all too often teachers are seen as people who are not well-educated, have summers off, get great benefits, and do not work all that much because they get out of school at 3:30.† I refuse to even discuss these statements with people anymore, because they are ignorant of how hard and dedicated the teachers of NC are.†Yet we always do more with less and once again are being asked to give up more. †
* I and many of my colleagues†arrive at†work at 6 or 6:30 a.m. and work many days past 5:00 p.m. or later and weekends. We volunteer for so many organizations, clubs, sports, free tutoring, and we do†so much paperwork that is not related to actually teaching, that I am overwhelmed by the work load - which by the way - adds to stress -†and studies have shown is related to weight gain. Now we must watch our health plan decline (even more).†
* There is a bill in the legislature proposed by one representative to make the graduation project OPTIONAL†in order to cut costs.† That is a change that can help cut costs and work load.† Please support it.
* The bill is very sketchy about information that is needed by its members to see exact costs.
* Retired people will suffer greatly under this proposed bill as they are already on a fixed income.†
* All money from the education lottery should go to education as it was promoted and passed because of this idea.† None of this money should go to the general fund.
I cannot understand how at the very basic levels of this bill, it could be thought of as acceptable. Please support your state's teachers and change this bill.† Give all members of the state health plan time to read and understand it and not allow it to be†pushed through our state legislature without much more careful analysis.†
Thank you.
