Comment: Please consider keeping the Wright School in Durham open as I have a very close friend whose daughter just graduated from there middle of last year and it has completely transformed her life. She has learned life behaviors she wasn't able to learn at home and she will now have a brighter future. Thank you. Kim Petty

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am a longtime public educator who has experienced firsthand what children in this state need. I am writing today to encourage you to support the Wright School fully in this year's budget and in coming years. My colleague and friend Linda McDonough is a parent with a child at Wright School. Her daughter has been helped tremendously by her stay at the school. This is a program that works in taking difficult cases and making a difference in children's lives. I think that the state should focus on what works in government. Please fully fund this worthy educational initiative, Governor Purdue. Sincerely Yours, David Frauenfelder, Ph.D.

Subject: Do Not Close the Wright School

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As one of the families that voted for you, We are writing to ask you to reconsider your recommendation to close The Wright School. Our 12 year old daughter, Mackenna attended the Wright School after we struggled with her emotional and psychological state without avail for more than 7 years. In 2007, we were in the process of preparing our Wright School application when Mackenna's 8 year old sister was diagnosed with terminal bone Cancer. This took Mackenna's fragile emotional state to an all time critical point but she was thankfully accepted into the Wright School. If it were not for the highly qualified and caring staff at the Wright School, I am convinced that our daughter Mackenna would most likely be institutionalized today as a result of her sister's death because she would not have been emotionally equipped to deal with it prior to her re-education at the Wright School. We believe in the Wright School so completely that when our daughter Colleen died in June of 2008, we requested that donations be made to the Wright School in lieu of flowers. Unfortunately, these donations do not replace the critical funding that the state provides the school. Please reconsider your decision to close this school. If it is closed, We are convinced that a much higher price will be paid as many children will end up in other institutions with much higher price tags and end up using IPRS and other state funds. Respectfully Yours, James and Diane Moore Raleigh, NC

Subject: The Wright School

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: I am writing about the Wright School, which is in danger of being closed in these difficult financial times. I realize you have some tough choices to make, but I have seen the difference this school has made in the lives of kids, and a dear family friend in particular. This child was fostered, then adopted by a caring woman who had a degree in Special Education. Her issues emerged early-on, and continued to escalate for 10 years. And I know the child well; when not acting out, she is sweet, thoughtful and intelligent. When certain things overwhelm her, she is totally unmanageable - and I had a husband and teen boy helping me! This family lived through years of uncontrollable rages and their fallout; the Wright School was their last hope. And the staff there has worked miracles with this child and the family is functioning once again (this took work with the child and her family). If not for the Wright School, there is no doubt she, and many otheres, would end up in a Detention Facility instead of back into a functioning home. Please save the Wright School...it is so critical to the children of NC. Sincerely, Lisa Ray

Subject: Wright School funding

Comment: Hello Governor Purdue, and thank you for being accessible to us in this way. I wanted to tell you about my own support for the Wright School - I hope it is not too late for North Carolina to change our plan to close the school. I understand the difficult financial times we're in. But I believe that there must be better short-term spending cuts which we could implement - ones easier to correct later, or ones which would have less long-term impact. For I do believe that the positive results the Wright School achieves pay for far more than its cost in long term savings and benefits to the state. Also, this program would be particularly difficult to recreate quickly, and as successfully as it is operating today, once we get past the current crisis and decide again that this kind of North Carolina school should be funded by our state and our citizens. Thank you again for considering our comments and thoughts and priorities for North Carolina in this way. Jon Schwartz Chapel Hill

Re: Proposed N.C. Budget Cuts in DHR: Whitaker School and Wright School
Dear Governor Perdue:
I am writing this letter to express disappointment and opposition to the proposed budget cuts that would result in the closing of both the Whitaker School and the Wright School.  These two programs currently serve some of the most emotionally disturbed, at-risk students in the state.  It would be an extremely shortsighted decision for both humanitarian and fiscal reasons for these services to be cut.  As you may know, many of the children in these programs have been abused, neglected, and are without any social support or structure in their lives. If anything, these types of programs need more funding.  These facilities are designed to prevent future problems by intervening with current problems.  As you know, mental health care services in North Carolina are currently deplorable, and many people who require such services are ending up in our prisons, emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and morgues, resulting in both increasing long-term human misery and monetary costs.  
These two programs provide services that our state should feel obligated to provide its youth.
Our school system has had a number of students who benefited from treatment from the Wright and Whitaker Schools. I do not believe that if the benefit and worth of these programs was competently evaluated that these proposed cuts would be given a second thought by anyone who cares about the youth of this State.   I understand that the economic situation is dire at this time, and we suggest that rather than taking away from those who already have close to nothing, consider making budget cuts that take a more "top-down" approach.   The closing of these two schools will only succeed in making a bad situation much worse.
I strongly encourage you to withdraw this proposal and to visit these schools and learn more about their mission, structure, and the services they provide to this under-served population of troubled youth in our state.

Respectfully,

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue I understand that budget cuts are about to force the closing of The NC Wright School. I strongly oppose this! I feel that it's extremely important that this school remain open, because of the crucial effect I have seen it have upon families I know personally. I don't think we can afford to eliminate a service so important; we will only pay the price later, when these troubled kids become much bigger problems to society and to the State. Please do not cut the budget for the NC Wright School! Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely yours, Patricia J. Ayers Chapel Hill, NC

Comment: In my view, it is false economy to try to help the state budget by closing Wright and Whitaker Schools. Untreated mental illness in children and adolescents is not only a problem for families, it's very costly for the state in terms of impact on schools, criminal justice, social services, and many other ways. Treatment works! And these schools have demonstrated their cost-effectiveness. I have a son who was psychotic at age 11 (now 48 and relatively independent) -- we were able to afford care at Duke and John Umstead Hospital's Children's Unit, as well as supportive private schools after that. Many families cannot afford any of this -- and the state cannot afford to let these kids down. I would be happy to put up with fewer new roads or higher taxes to provide for the needs of our people. Thank you.

Subject: Re: The closing of Wright School

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I hope you are NEVER in the position to know what it's like to have a family member suffer with mental illness, but I would like for you to know a little about how this affected my family. My cousin Randy was an smart and loving teenager when he began to show the effects of mental illness. At that time, he was an average, fun-loving kid, with a big mop of curly hair, an impish smile, and a husky laugh that made everyone around him laugh, too. Then his behavior changed. He began to hear voices in his head, began to act inappropriate ways, to do things that didn't make any kind of sense, that were totally unlike him. His diagnosis of Schizophrenia shattered his parents, but they were determined to do all they could for him. In the 70's, there was much less that could be done for those suffering from mental illness, still, his parents tried and tried again to get him the help he needed. He was in and out of a number of facilities for several years, as the rest of us were growing up, learning to drive, having typical teenage fun. I remember our family reunion, at Carolina Beach, in August of 1979. Randy was in a mental hospital at the time. We called him from a pay phone on the board walk and all of the cousins waited for our turn to chat with him, to tell him we loved him, that we wished he was with us. I cannot imagine the torment that Randy went through. He so wanted to be "normal" like the rest of us. He wanted so much to please the parents that he loved, but he knew that he caused them untold tears and worry. His suffering was never ending and inescapable. He could never know if the things he saw were really there and he couldn't get away from the whisperings he heard. On March 3, 1983, he seemed to be in one of his more lucid moods. He and his mother spent an enjoyable evening watching a movie together. When it was over, he kissed his mother good-night, told her he loved her, then went into the basement, where he put a hunting rifle under his chin and pulled the trigger. He was 21 years old. In a week and a half, it will be 26 years since that night, though in many ways, it seems like it happened yesterday. I'm sure it's true for all people who lose loved ones through suicide that you NEVER get over the "Why's" and "What if's". WHAT IF the hunting rifle and the bullets had been disposed of, so Randy hadn't had access? WHAT IF his brother had gotten home just a few minutes earlier, in time to stop him? WHY did this have to happen to our family, to our sweet, talented cousin/nephew/son/brother? WHY would a loving God inflict anyone with such a cruel, tormenting disease? I read the other day that researchers are hoping to isolate a cure for Schizophrenia by 2013. What an answer to prayer that day will be. Still, untold thousands of young people TODAY are suffering like my cousin suffered, from schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. I like to imagine that if my cousin were a young person today, his story would have a different outcome. If he had had the opportunity to attend a facility like the Wright School, he would been around other kids who suffered with similar afflictions, instead of always feeling "different". He would have learned to live with his affliction, without being made to feel that he responsible for it. He would've been been taught how to appreciate and use the many God-given talents which made him unique, instead of being sure that he was "defective", "unworthy" and "a burden". I'd like to imagine that if my cousin had access to a facility like the Wright School, he'd be alive today, with a family of his own. I like to imagine him surviving to face the wrinkles and bulges of middle age alongside me, instead of being eternally 21. I'd like to imagine him as a happy, whole, functioning adult, instead of the anguished and tormented child who pulled that trigger. I did NOT mean to write a letter of this length, which has taken me the better part of a work week to finish, as well as a whole lot of tears. But maybe this letter is my chance to glean something worthwhile out of Randy's fate. If I can influence your decision, to persuade you of the worth of the Wright School and other facilities that treat young people with mental illnesses and persuade you to leave these facilities open, then you will truly be honoring him and his memory. There is a quote that has come to my mind over and over, these last few days, as I've been writing this letter, one that has been attributed to many world leaders throughout the centuries. Gandhi said, "A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members." But I like Hubert Humphrey's take on this philosophy the best. He said, "...the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; those who are in the shadows of life; the sick, the needy and the handicapped. " On your Inauguration Day, I watched you take your oath with my daughters, shed a tear and told them that the inauguration of our first female Governor and our first Black President meant that politics - and our country - were forever changed for the better. Please, Governor Perdue, DO THE RIGHT THING by leaving the Wright School - and other mental health facilities - open! Do this for my cousin, Randy, and all the children who still suffer like he did, for those who are still "in the dawn of their lives". Thank you so very much. Sincerely, Teri Johnson Pasley

I write in support of Wright School. It provides excellent long term residential treatment for youngsters with serious emotional and behavioral problems. This program works! It is cost effective! It is a shining star in North Carolina's mental health system!

Please do your part to ensure that Wright School remains fully funded now and in the future.

Dear Governor Perdue,

As a mental health professional, I was shocked and dismayed to hear of
plans to close Wright School and Whitaker School. As a staff member on
the UNC Child and Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatric Unit, I would often
refer our toughest cases to these schools, because I knew that they
were effective. These schools have changed the lives of many children,
and are considered 'miracle workers' by many. Yes, they are expensive,
but considering how cost-effective they are (how expensive is it to
house a felon in a penitentiary?), they are doubtlessly worth the
money.

I urge you to reconsider this plan.

Sincerely,

Comment: It would be penny-wise and pound-foolish to deny critical mental health resources to kids who need them. Treatment is always cheaper than incarceration! Sincerely, Carl Stearns

Hello,

My name is Pamela Gray and I am a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in Durham, NC.  I provide in-home therapy to children and adolsecents and their familes.  Many of the children and and families I work with cope with a range of severe mental, emotional, and beavhiroal issues that challenge their ability to function daily. 

I am concerned about the news that Gov. Purdue plans to close the doors of the Wright School Re-Education Center in Durham.  I hope that she reconsiders this plan, as the Wright School offers high-quality treatment for children and their families who have reached the end of the line and have no where else to go. 

Many of these kids have been kicked out of multiple schools, and have no ability to maintain in a traditional school setting.  I understand the argument that cost of treatment is high ($28,000 per stay).  However, imagine the long-term costs to society of an adult who is

* emotionally disturbed
* possibly with a severe mental illness
* has no education since there was no educatonal facility who could meet their needs
* has poor socialization because they never received the treatment that they needed
* is isolated from their family who is "burnt out" from caretaking, and
* has no ability to cope with their own mental health symptoms or with the world around them 
The costs will be far greater than if the individual had the chance to be at the Wright School, so that they and their families could gain the skills necessary to cope with their symtoms, and the education necessary to be productive members of society despite their disabilities.

Please keep this option open to the mentally ill children of North Carolina and their families.  Please send me a reply so that I know this message was read.

Thank you!

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #18186] Budget cut concern
Date: Fri, 27 Feb 2009 14:26:48 -0500
X-Folder: Wright School

Dear Governor Perdue;

I applaud your efforts to bring state costs under control. There are
always better ways of using our resources for state government.

I do want to urge you not to cut services and programs that do work
well. An example of this is in the education sector. As a former
teacher and administrator I view with interest things that do and
don't work. From personal experience I know that one idea that has
worked and I hope that it will not be on the list for cutting or
closing.

Wright School is a residential mental health treatment facility that
provides best practice, cost-effective treatment to NC children with
serious mental, emotional and behavioral disorders, ages 6-12. They
provide support to the childs family and community in building the
capacity to meet childrens special needs in their home, school and
local community. Children stay an average of six months and return
home each weekend. As part of the NC Department of Health and Human
Services, the childs stay is free to parents and the childs
community, and is one of the few places parents can seek help without
adding financial worries to their load.

Wright School is cost-effective. It costs the state approximately
$28,000 for each childs stay. While that sounds like a lot,
hospitalization in a psychiatric ward costs around $1000 per day. Many
of the children at Wright School have been hospitalized numerous
times. These kids also often take up school, police, and local
resources.

Wright School works. 95% of parents whose children have attended
Wright School report being pleased with the services they received. A
high number of Wright School graduates maintain long term progress.
These are some of the states most troubled and violent children who
have proved resistant to other interventions. See www.wrightschool.org/study.htm
  for research findings. The staff is highly trained and has very
little turnover.

Wright School provides hope to parents and children who have gone too
long without it. The staff believes each child can improve, regardless
of diagnosis. They dont give up. And that belief is justified as
children begin to feel pride in their improvement.

Wright School is based on sound research-based principles, called Re-
Education. See www.wrightschool.org/reed.htm for the list. Number 12
begins A child should know some joy in each day . . .  Joy is not
something troubled children or their parents expect to feel. Parents
will tell you that Wright School works miracles and returns joy to
their lives and the lives of their children.

Governor Perdue, I have a granddaughter in this school who will be
graduating this summer. She is an extremely bright young lady but has
had severe behavioral problems. The staff at Wright  School have
worked with her very effectively and will continue to do so until she
is settled into her regular school this coming fall. I shutter to
think what will happen to others in her situation that would qualify
for the program and find that it has been closed.

Wright School is something that works. Let us not punish them for
being successful.

Thank you for your consideration.

Comment: Please keep Wright and Whitaker Schools open. These facilities may seem expensive; however they save our state money in the long term. These preventative programs keep children out of hospitals, which are much more expensive, overall. Please reconsider the closure of these schools because many of our children will be adversely affected by their closures.

Subject: Wright School in Durham

Comment: It is my understanding that the Wright School in Durham may not be funded. I beg you not to close the doors on this facility. I have a son in school there now, and I have seen firsthand what can be accomplished. My son has had behavioral problems since the age of two. He has been hospitalized numerous times in the past, once staying for two months when he was younger. He is now thirteen years old and has had charges brought against him for hitting several school employees before going to the Wright School. He has tried different medications for ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and early onset bipolar disorder. He has been seen by a behavioral pediatrician since the age of two. He was born crack cocaine positive, and I adopted him at the age of fourteen months. I am an educator in an elementary school and have taught for thirty-six years. I have read extensively trying to help him. He has had therapy through our mental health facility in our county since the age of five. I basically have tried to get help for him any where that I could think to look. I had heard wonderful things about Wright School and was able to get my son in the school at the end of September, 2008. He had begun to hate going to school and did not want to do his work. Since going to Wright School, he has begun to enjoy school again because he is learning to control his actions. He is learning what to do when he feels frustrated because they are teaching him coping skills. I am following up at home with their methods. He will "graduate" from Wright School March 26th. The liason from Wright School, his former principal and teacher, my son and I, and others met last week and all involved were extremely pleased with the way he was able to communicate his feelings with them. They saw great changes in him. Before he would have totally withdrawn, been sullen, and avoided eye contact. Now he is much more open, makes eye contact, and is able to admit his mistakes. He has learned to remove himself from a situation that before would have caused him to explode and attack. I now have hope that he can continue in seventh grade in public school and be successful and happy without having to worry that someone around him may get hurt because of his actions. Wright School has helped to give my son a much brighter future - but not only my son, but many more before him. This is one of the programs that must not be cut. It is too vital to our youth. Hospitalizations in a psychiatric ward for a week are not the answer. In fact, nothing was really accomplished for my son when he was hospitalized those times. Keep the Wright School open is my plea.

Subject: Please keep Wright School open

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing in support of the Wright School. I have heard that this school may be closed due to the economic crisis in North Carolina. I am writing both as a friend of a mother with a child in the school, and as a professional trained in Social Work and Maternal and Child Health. My friend's child, and my friend, who adopted the child in the Wright School, have both suffered a great deal since the child was very young. The child has had very severe behavior issues as long as I can remember and has been through years of testing and various interventions, all to little avail. My friend is a teacher by profession and has more patience than I have ever seen in a parent, and has struggled to find a way to help her child. Finally, her child ended up at the Wright School, and is flourishing for the first time in many years. The problems with her child have cost her her job, and since her child is in the Wright School, she can work again. The Wright School and the Wittaker School (where fellow social workers have worked and have excellent things to say about the program) are important in preventing children with severe behavioral issues and even violent tendencies from ending up quitting school and ending up in the criminal justice system. I urge you to keep the school open not only for kids like my friend's child, but for the well-being of our state, which needs such preventive measures to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens. I realize that these are difficult times, and that you must make many tough choices. However, I urge you to work to keep the Wright School and the Wittiker School open. Sincerely, Sara Smith, MSPH, MSW

Subject: Closing Wright School

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, If you choose to close the Wright School in Durham that will be a shame and a mistake. I was appointed by Secretary Hooker Buell to be a member of the Human Rights Committee at Wright School several years ago and I can tell you that the services provided to the children and greater community are beyond invaluable. I also worked for the state at Dorothea Dix for 7 years and know first hand how badly run a state facility can be. The Wright School is about the ONLY state facillity I know of that has hard working, truly caring professionals who see their jobs as more than a "job." Please do not take away one of the only shining stars in DHHS. You will impact not only the current children of NC, but the future of NC as well. This is NOT the place to cut. Sincerely, Sylvia McCarty

Comment: The staff at Wright School has 400 years of collective experience. Not only do they save kids but they train others in effective methods as well. Closing it is both giving up on some of our neediest kids as well as "eating our seed corn". On the anniversary of Eve Carson's death, we need to work to keep NC's most troubled and violent children from following the path that Lovette and Atwater did. This is not a program to close. Please don't continue mental health deform. We elected you to be something better than that. Thank you, Linda McDonough, whose child has been helped by Wright School

Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to urge you and the NC Legislators to spare the Wright School in Durham as you are making your necessary budget cuts. I understand that these cuts are necessary, however, North Carolina's children need The Wright School to stay open. For families, such as my friends, this school has been a miracle for her mentally ill, adopted child. This child was born to a drug addicted mother and has struggle with mental illness for most of her 10 years of life. finally, this year, she has gotten some real help by attending The Wright School, and for the first time her mother has hope that she can be successful in society. I heard you say last night that you would not cut services for our most important resource-- our children. For children who suffer from mental illness, this school has a proven track record for success. Please keep in mind the following facts and figures: Wright School is cost-effective. It costs the state approximately $28,000 for each childs stay. While that sounds like a lot, hospitalization in a psychiatric ward costs around $1000 per day. Many of the children at Wright School have been hospitalized numerous times. These kids also often take up school, police, and local resources. Wright School works. 95% of parents whose children have attended Wright School report being pleased with the services they received.

Comment: Dear Governor: As part of your budget proposal, you have indicated your desire to close the Wright School, which is the only one residential one in NC serving mentally ill children 6-12 years old. In a state that has historically underfunded programs for the mentally ill (it made some progress in the past year, however) this represents a serious backward step. We are keenly aware of the very difficult state budget that the financial crisis makes necessary, but surely there must be some other areas where reductions can be made in order to spare the Wright School. As the old saying goes, you spend now or you spend much more later. Inadequate support now for the mentally ill results in much greater directly related costs in the future. Thank you for your attention. Denny O'Neal and Helen Drivas

Subject: NC DHHS Budget / The Wright School

Comment: Dear Ms. Perdue, My daughter, Mackenna, attended the Wright School for 7 months in 2007. We had been dealing with her mental health issues with only minimal success for over five years prior to this. We had tried many different psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and programs. The Wright School helped my daughter more than any of these other people or programs -- and they had the deck stacked against them at the time because my younger daughter Colleen, Mackenna's, younger sister, was dying with cancer. Despite this horrible family medical situation the Wright school made far more progress -- lasting progress -- with Mackenna. We have been out of Wright School for six months, but we are still enjoying the benefits of this progress as Mackenna is doing well at Durant Middle School, both socially and acedemically. She is playing team sports for the first time in her life. She is just functioning on a new level. We can't thank the wonderful people at the Wright School enough. I am personally willing to contribute money or time if that in any way will help keep the Wright School open. Please let me know if there is anything I can personally do to help influence the budget decisions in the Wright School's favor. Sincerely, James V. Moore, III

Subject: Possibility of closing Wright and Whitaker Schools

Comment: It has come to my attention that closing Wright School in Durham and Whitaker School in Butner are listed as possible money-saving options on the table for North Carolina. While I certainly appreciate the necessity to slash costs during these devastating times, I also understand the critical place these Schools have in the lives of families with troubled children. One of those children attends my church, and I know first-hand how important the Wright School program is for this family. At present, there are NO OTHER options ("community settings") in Durham County for emotionally disturbed children. These children cannot be mainstreamed in most cases, and attempts to do so would be potentially dangerous for them and for the community. I urge you to reconsider closing Wright and/or Whitaker as an option for cutting costs. There has to be another way.

Re: Proposed N.C. Budget Cuts in DHR: Whitaker School and Wright School


Dear Governor Perdue:

I am writing this letter to express disappointment and opposition to the proposed budget cuts that would result in the closing of both the Whitaker School and the Wright School.  These two programs currently serve some of the most emotionally disturbed, at-risk students in the state.  It would be extremely concerning for both humanitarian and fiscal reasons for these services to be cut.  Many of the children in these programs have been abused, neglected, and are without any social support or structure in their lives. If anything, these types of programs need more funding.  These facilities are designed to prevent future problems by intervening with current problems.  As you know, mental health care services in North Carolina are currently deplorable, and many people who require such services are ending up in our prisons, emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and morgues, resulting in both increasing long-term human misery and monetary costs.  These two programs provide services that our state should feel obligated to provide its youth.

Our school system has had a number of students who benefited from treatment from the Wright and Whitaker Schools. I do not believe that if the benefit and worth of these programs was competently evaluated that these proposed cuts would be given a second thought by anyone who cares about the youth of this State.   I understand that the economic situation is dire at this time, and I suggest that rather than taking away from those who already have close to nothing, consider making budget cuts that take a more âtop-downâ approach.   The closing of these two schools will only succeed in making a bad situation much worse.

I strongly encourage you to withdraw this proposal and to visit these schools and learn more about their mission, structure, and the services they provide to this underserved population of troubled youth in our state.

Respectfully,


Bethany Passick

Comment: My brother is employed at the Wright school and I am a firm believer that what they do there makes a huge difference in those childrens lives. For some it is the only stability that they have ever known and the staff truly loves those children. Please reconsider your budget cuts for these children's sake. Thank you

Comment: PLEASE DO NOT close or reduce funding to the Wright School or the Whitaker School. These programs and the services they provide to families in North Carolina are vital to essential behavior modification/re-training for youth who already struggle at home, in school and in their communities. Without such programs they will quickly become members of an invisible society in this state and another sad statistic of the failing mental health care system in North Carolina;

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please use your influence as governor to keep intact the budget of the  
Wright School, the most effective program for our state's mentally ill  
and most vulnerable children.

I know you agree that the best government is that which allocates  
resources to those who are least able to take care of themselves.  
Please continue full funding of the Wright School for children who are  
doing much, much better in the school's care than possible anywhere  
else.

Sincerely,

     As a social worker intern in Warren County, I have seen what a 
lack of resources can mean for children in the foster care system. 
Children in care need structure, guidance, role models, and, in many 
cases, therapy. Warren County is poor and rural and its foster children 
do not get the funding, facilities, or opportunities that are available 
to children in larger counties. The Wright School and the Whitaker 
School have become an important resource to this county and its 
residents in recent months. These schools may be the only option for 
placement when children are affected by mental illness or severe 
behavioral issues.

     I have personally followed one student?s progression into the 
Wright School. The options available to this child were exhausted prior 
to application for enrollment to the Wright School. The agency and the 
family tried a foster home, a therapeutic foster home, a therapeutic 
group home, and intensive in-home services to assist the child with 
severe emotional needs. None were effective in curbing the child?s 
angry outbursts, improving his interactions with peers, or addressing 
the mental illness diagnosis. In the last few months, this child has 
made incredible progress with the guidance and support of the staff at 
the Wright School. For the first time, the treatment team has created 
an IEP directly related to addressing the child?s personal needs and 
holds monthly meetings to evaluate the child?s progress towards his 
goals. If goals prove to be unattainable in the short term, the team 
rewrites the goals into smaller steps so that the child will feel 
successful in his efforts to accomplish each item on the list.       
Not only has the Wright School been supportive of the child, but the 
staff has worked diligently on issues affecting the family as a unit. 
The school is assisting in reunification efforts between the mother and 
child and maintains a family centered approach at all times. Staff from 
Wright School have encouraged the mother to participate in a parenting 
workshop that they hold on campus as well as meeting with her one on 
one to address her individual parenting skill needs in her home. They 
approach this task at the mother?s pace and praise her successes at 
each turn. The team respects the outside relationships that have been 
formed with therapists and caseworkers who are not on their staff and 
give them an equal voice in the treatment plan for the well-being of 
the family.

     The Wright School has made an incredible difference in the life of 
one troubled boy from Warren County through dedication and diligence of 
the staff. This child came from public school where he was in trouble 
most days and a foster family who called the police because they could 
not handle his behavior. Today, he has received numerous awards for 
behavior, anger management, peer relationships, and academic progress 
based solely on the influence of the Wright School.  It would be a 
shame for such a valuable resource for the mentally ill in North 
Carolina to lose funding.

     Please help maintain the services provided at the Wright School 
and the Whitaker School through your vote on the state budget.

RE: Proposal to close Wright and Whitaker Schools



Dear Governor Perdue,



The Chatham County Board of Commissioners is requesting that you reconsider your decision to close both the Wright and Whitaker Schools, which provide critical residential mental health services for children from our county and across the state.  We understand your need to reduce State expenditures in these economically difficult times; however, eliminating these vital programs will not only put the lives of emotionally disturbed children/adolescents who are at risk of needing higher levels of care, but will actually cost the state and local governments considerably more in public expenditures over time.  Moreover, there are currently are no suitable replacements for these residential programs. Thus, even in the short term, the expenditures you might save in these two programs will result in additional and far more costly expenditures when this type of treatment falls completely on the other resources of the State and/or counties. (See the attached background information sheet.) The programs at Wright and Whitaker provide essential treatment for children/adolescents in need by working directly with the parents on how to more effectively communicate with and otherwise manage their young people at home. 



By all accounts these institutions are both programmatically and fiscally efficient and effective. Additionally, these two schools have received overwhelming praise from the population they serve and from the social service and educational professionals in their home communities.  Many of these children and adolescents have been able to return to their families and local schools after treatment.  Professionals with our Orange Person Chatham Area Mental Health Program, which during the last four years has successfully placed fourteen (14) and seven (7) Chatham County children in the Wright and Whitaker schools respectively, have confirmed this.



If these schools are closed, costs for treatment will rise and fall on other resources of the State or those served will be left to their own devices to compensate. The Wright School for instance, costs about $28,000 for the childs stay. If a group home and day treatment program were the option, that figure goes to something like $64,000.  More importantly, the costs to the children and adolescents, their families and their communities of eliminating these crucial residential services  is incalculable, as our District Court judges will attest.



Most important, these schools actually work. The return to a more normal life and reintegration into the regular school system is far better than hospitalization or inadequate treatment in some other setting.  The low staff turnover rate for both schools attests to the dedication, effectiveness and training of these professionals.



We urge you to keep these schools open and viable. There may be some areas of mental health that are redundant, where costs might be cut, but the Wright and Whitaker Schools are not in that category.



Thank you for considering our urgent request that you reconsider your plans to close these two schools.



Sincerely,



Chairman Dr. George Lucier

For the Board of Chatham County Commissioners

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am writing in support of the Chatham County Commissioners' letter to 
you asking you to reconsider cutting Wright and Whitaker schools, and 
beyond that, to reinstate support to our most vulnerable populations  by 
putting back in the budget funds for mental health, developmental 
disability and substance abuse services in North Carolina.  These 
services actually save the state money by helping these citizens become 
more functional.  I also urge you to consider increasing funds through 
progressive taxation and through closing corporate loopholes.

I support the request of the Chatham County Commissioners to reconsider your decision to close these two schools. Having worked as a school psychologist for many years in NY before moving to NC I recognize that residential programs such as these are vital to our children with serious mental health problems that cannot be alleviated by local community resources.

IN ADDITION, please consider taking a few more minutes of your time to take action on both of these advocacy opportunities to prevent funding cuts to vital Mental Health (MH), Developmental Disability (DD) and Substance Abuse (SA) funding.


1) Please go to:  <http://www.petitiononline.com/MHDDSA/petition.html>http://www.PetitionOnline.com/MHDDSA/petition.html  and sign the online petition to "Maintain Funding Supports for Mental Health, Developmental Disability and Substance Abuse Services in North Carolina". 


2) Please call  (919)733-4240  or fax (919)733-2120 or email (<mailto:Governor.office@nc.gov>Governor.office@nc.gov) or write the Governors office and request that Gov. Perdue NOT cut funding for MH/DD/SA services.

Then go to the Capitol Advantage Legislative Site:  <http://capwiz.com/cdpmi/home/>http://capwiz.com/cdpmi/home/  to access info for contacting your NC legislators.
You can use the following message(s) from the petition requesting Governor Bev Perdue and members of the North Carolina Legislature to:

1. NOT reduce any funding to state budgets that serve people who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues.


2. NOT reduce funding to educational programs that provide services and supports to special needs children in North Carolina and to find a way to INCREASE funding sources to these vital programs.


Additional talking points:
*Mental Health funding in NC is currently 43rd per capita among all states in funding for mental illness in NC. The current status of inadequate resources and funding for services provided to citizens of North Carolina who struggle with mental illness, developmental delays or substance abuse issues should not be exacerbated with additional funding cuts.
