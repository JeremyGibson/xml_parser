Subject: Mileage tax

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I live in rural Stokes County because I am poor and cannot afford housing in Winston Salem. Everyone in my neighborhood lives in trailers and commutes to work. If you impose a mileage tax on us, it will in essense punish us for not being able to live in the city because of our economic situation. You will succeed in making us even less prosperous. As an American, I also strongly object to anyone tracking my movements. I am a law abiding citizen. But I understand that if, for instance, the government decides my religion is invalid, and I continue to worship, like what is happening right now in China and other countries every day, having a tracking device on me will be convenient. Does this sound paranoid? Maybe. Do I want to ever lose the ability to be completely free in America? A little freedom is being stolen away every year by our government agencies. My husband is Cuban. He lived through the loss of freedom in his country, and he was arrested and incarcerated by Castro. Did he ever expect that to happen in his country? No, the Cuban people were taken by surprise. They supported Castro on an "Anyone but Batista" platform, and they have been suffering ever since. We are definitely getting change in America. Scary change. Please do not contribute to taking away my freedom.

Subject: concern over mileage tax

Comment: Hello! I am VERY concerned over the rumors I have been hearing about taxing motorists on mileage. I deliver newspapers as my family's sole income as I have an elderly father to care for. If a measure like this was passed, it would place my family and the families of many people that need their vehicles for work in serious distress,not to mention even more unemployment since so many of us would have to quit our jobs because we could not afford the tax.I can understand placing toll booths on heavily traveled roads or even increasing the price of tag renewal. However, so many of the carriers I know simply cannot afford such a devastating blow. We do not make a large income and as newspaper carriers, we are ineligible for unemployment if something was to happen to our jobs. Such a tax would destroy our income completely.In addition to the newspaper carriers, I also think of the impact it would have on mail carriers. With rumors of mail going to five day delivery I would imagine this will decrease their income as well.If they were forced to pay additional money to deliver mail I feel they would also have to seek different employment. Sadly,in this day and time, that is much easier said than done. In closing, I would like to say that I am pleased to have you as our governor and pray that you will not consider such a drastic measure.The delivery people of North Carolina can't afford to see this happen. Thank you for your time and may God Bless You!!

Subject: TAXES

Comment: Gov. Purdue, I have one request to make of your office. Keep your hands off my money. The US government is doing a good job right now of making sure that we have less and less each day. I sure hope you don't intend to follow suit with any new tax and spend policies. And as for this proposed Mileage Tax. Stop it right there. I will pay my tax at the gas pump, but you keep your nose out of my personal driving habits. I will not stand for an Orwellian society. That is an intrusion into my personal life. I drive to and from work, for work, to church, friends, family and pleasure. I will not be made to feel that I am being spied on. Next thing you know, someone will want to put a tracking chip in my vehicle, and track me like some criminal. NO THANKS. If this state needs money for road repairs, put a toll on that road. Other states do it and no one complains. You either drive it or you don't. Pure and simple. Why doesn't someone up there in Raleigh "WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE" Lori Blais

Subject: Opposed to Mileage Tax

Comment: I am very opposed to the mileage tax. I was laid off in December and just started a new job last week. I had to take a pay cut of one third of my previous salary in my new position. My husband and I are already overtaxed. The only places that I typically drive are to work and to my mother's house. My mother is 70 and I am providing her with care and support. I drive 68 miles roundtrip to take her to the doctor, mow her yard, and help her around the house. This new tax would pose a great hardship. Sincerely, Sheila Johnson

Subject: Personal Property Taxes (Car tax)

Comment: I am fully against taxing our autos based on miles driven. Gas is way too high in NC, so that people do not drive any more than they have to now; and now, you want them to quit traveling or driving anywhere? How can you tax them on how many miles they drive? People, some, have very long commutes just to get to work. And vacation? Never, if this is how you will be taxed. This will hurt the economy even more. Please do not tax based on miles driven. That will definitely stop people from driving anywhere they do not need to and will penalize folks who have a long commute or just want to vacation. Thank you.

Subject: Enery Taxation

Comment: I can't believe that some people are urging that a mileage tax on vehicles be substituted for, or added to, a per-gallon tax. Do they honestly recommend that an 8,000 pound SUV polluting our environment at the rate of a gallon every 15 miles and tearing up the highways twice as fast as a 4,000 pound compact using one gallon every 45 miles be taxed at the same rate? Ridiculous!! That'll just penalize fuel efficiency when we should be rewarding it. This recommendation has to have been prepared by the oil industry, not by common sense people.

Subject: Smoking Ban and Mileage Gas Tax

Comment: Please make sure that NC does not pass a mileage gas tax. Gov't pushed for people to slow down on driving and for cars to produce more miles per gallon. Now they want to add another tax on miles driven. Enough is enough!!!!!!. We have to drive to different states just to find work, as the jobs in western NC is very limited. We would also like to support the ban on smoking in public places. It is hard to find a place to eat out when you are allergic to smoke. People don't smoke on airplanes, movies and a hand full of restaurants. I think they could hold off for a few minutes while you eat. You help is greatly appreciated
