Subject: Smokers and Fat People Insurance Increases

Comment: After watching the news I became aware of the proposed increase to insurance for smokers and obese individuals. "Did you run your 4 miles?" How completely clueless are you, by some guidelines I would just about bet that you yourself BEV Perdue would be considered over weight. Have you lost your mind? Do you really think that insurance companies NEED MORE MONEY?? I am a mother of 2 children, I have been battling the bulge since their birth and I currently can't get health insurance because of my weight. Can you not see past the nose on your face? Surly you can see that this is an attempt by the insurance companies to get more money?!!!! God I am so mad and to think I actually voted for you!

Subject: Health care plan

Comment: I agree that smokers and even abusers of alcohol should pay a higher price for health care. However, the issue of obesity is a sensitive area. How the standards for obesity are set, etc could become very contoversal. Some people are obese because of desease, illness or handicap. I saw the Gov on TV last night and her comments were sarcastic, degrading and uncalled for when she said: "at 5:30 this morning I did four miles, what were you doing then." Some retired employees are disabled and can't do "four miles" she owes those people an apology.
