Subject: Budget Cuts

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, I was encouraged when I went online and saw an outline of your proposed plan today. Please don't allow cuts to be made in education. As a Teacher's Assistant, I don't make a large amount of money. I get my joy from knowing that I am helping educate the next leaders of our great state and our great country. I love my job, and I love our kids! I work along with at least 12 other fine assistants who feel the same. Please keep us in mind when you make this tough decision. I would rather pay a little more in sales taxes, and still have a job. Thank you so much for letting me share this with you. Sincerely, Ginger Mullis

Subject: no pay increases for employees

Comment: I am an employee for Guilford County Schools and a Supervisor over 69 hard working school bus drivers who need and deserve their pay increase considering we have already been frozen before for 3 years, a fact some folks tend to forget. I have never written a goverment official before but feel I must speak out against this injustice. Let the Teachers and Principals live on what we make and see how many of them you have! You cannot keep taking from the middle class families and making sure the elite are taken care of. It is not fair!
