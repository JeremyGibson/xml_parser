Governor Perdue,

I want to thank you for your courageous leadership in proposing increased taxes on alcohol and tobacco.  For too long, our great state has lagged behind the nation in using such taxes to promote the health of our citizens.  Please let me know how I can support your efforts to pass this legislation.

Sincerely,

William Price, MD

I just wanted to say that I totally support your call for more taxes on tobacco and alcohol. I am not a smoker and never have been but I have spent many hours fighting for restrictions to public smoking. I believe raising the tax will reduce smoking even if the legislature does not have “b…s” to do something about it. I am, however, a drinker of good cold beer. I also support raising the tax on alcohol since so many problems come from consuming too much alcohol. It is time the sin paid for the problems it causes.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for proposing a $1.00 cigarette tax increase.  This will bring the tax in line with the national average and bring in needed revenue to help reduce the state's budget defecit.  Also, this will discourage young people from smoking and save billions in long-term health care costs.

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I applaud your proposal to increase cigarette and alcohol taxes. However, I'm deeply disappointed that there was no mention of increasing gasoline tax (but not diesel tax). Please act swiftly to correct this major oversight!

Dear Governor Bev Perdue,



I would like to take the time to say THANK YOU for proposing a tax increase on cigarettes.  It is a great way to help increase revenue for the state of NC in this time of troubling economics.  It is appalling to me that the cigarette tax rate is only 35 cents per pack when this is something that causes disease and death for not only the smoker but for the person affected by second hand smoke.  A great benefit of this tax increase will be the decline in youth smoking.  As a mother of two teenage children, this is very important to me. 



Thank you again for your care and concern of NC citizens. 



Sincerely,

Patty Hargrove

Dear Governor Perdue:

As a pathologist I see the effects of cigarette smoking on a daily basis. These include not only lung cancer but also heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, acute myeloid leukemia, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, laryngeal cancer, oral cancer and a host of other diseases.

I am sickened when I see a young person smoking. By increasing the cigarette tax you will not only raise revenue but also hopefully dissuade a large number of young people with limited resources from ever taking up the habit.

I do have one other recommendation. Please consider additional taxes on smokeless tobacco products as well. A large number of young people also try these highly addictive products which are the leading cause of oral cancer.

Again thank you for being brave enough to recommend this tax. Please stay the course even when the tobacco lobby strikes back.

Thanks

Dear Gov Perdue,

I applaud your decision to include a $1.00 per pack increase in the 
cigarette tax.

Both of my parents died from long-term cigarette usage, so I know 
firsthand about
the harmful consequences of cigarette smoking.  This tax should be a 
tremendous
incentive to stop or not start smoking and will have far-reaching 
positive results for
all the citizens of North Carolina.

Thank you, thank you,

Brenda Donleycott

Governor Perdue,

Thank you for your proposal to increase the cigarette tax in North Carolina by $1 per pack. This tax increase makes sense to raise valuable revenue for the state and decrease youth and hopefully adults from taking up or continuing to smoke and put their health and the health of others around them in harms way.
