Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to voice my protest toward your proposed outrageous tax increase of 385%† on a single pack of cigarettes in our great state of North Carolina.†

I† proudly voted for you and supported you in your recent campaign for Governor. As a life long resident of our state and retired tobacco factory worker in Cabarrus county, (forced into early retirement due to our plant's planned closing...another 2500 NC jobs down the drain), I am depending on my pension money (funded by Altria) to support my wife and myself in our retirement years.† If my pension money is gone due to a possible forced bankruptcy by legislation such as this, I beg the question?† Will the "Old North State" be there for me?

You cannot imagine my disappointment in your proposal.† I understand that our state is facing serious financial woes and tough decisions will have to be made.† But to propose such legislation that would most likely shut down an entire industry that is so important to our state, is beyond my comprehension.† It makes no sense to me for†our state to in essence, put more citizens out of work.

Why not a propose a ten, twenty, maybe even a twenty-five percent increase?†Those modest increases would generate some needed funds†while at the same time keep†thousands of North Carolinians working and save an industry from being put out of business.

†But a 385% increase?† Please!

Respectfully Yours,

Rick S. Lott

"God Bless The Old North State, and Long Live the Land Of the Long Leaf Pine"

To: The Honorable Governor Bev Purdue

PLEASE do NOT increase the Cigarette Taxes on North Carolina's citizens.

‚Äì More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, 
manufacturing and distribution.

‚Äì Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 
years.

‚Äì The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in 
history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C. This increase would just 
add to the problem...and as consumption goes down, the actual revenue 
for the State could actually go DOWN !!!

Economists predict North Carolina could lose 3,000 jobs as a result of 
the federal tax increase alone ‚Äì and that‚Äôs an increase of 62 cents a 
pack, compared with the $1 a pack increase you're proposing.

Washington D.C. may not care about jobs in N.C., but we expect better 
judgment out of Raleigh.

‚Äì On April 1, the average retail price of a carton of Full Priced 
Cigarettes will be $44. If your proposal is adopted, that could be $55 
per carton.

The new FET will increase the TAXES on NC Adult Smokers over $226 per 
year!! Your proposal would add another $360 per year for a pack-a-day 
smoker! That's almost $600 per year per citizen that chooses to consume 
a totally legal product.

‚Äì That has a disproportionate negative effect on the ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù in 
our state.

Overwhelmingly, Cig
arette taxes are paid by the "working poor."

- 55% of smokers are working poor.

- One in four smokers lives below the poverty line.

- Median family income of North Carolina smokers is $33,437.

- 80% of smokers make less than $75,000.

This affects all of us...not just smokers. If the tax goes up, then so 
does unemployment, crime, smuggled (non-taxed) goods. Retailers and 
Manufacturer jobs...and all the other consumer goods they purchase will 
be at risk.

PLEASE do NOT raise the cigarette taxes for North Carolina!

If you've read this far, I am much appreciative. I would very much like 
to hear your thoughts on why you think this proposal makes sense for 
North Carolina and hope that you're open minded enough to consider 
alternatives to your opinion on this matter.

Sincerely, a concerned citizen,

Mr. K C Satchell

Subject: Tobacco Tax Increase

Comment: I'd like to know your justification for taxing a minority to pay for the problems of a whole state. While I understand the need to raise money to pay for your inflated state budget, is it really fair to target a small percentage of the population to pay for it? It would be much more equitable for ALL of the citizens of the state to chip in. A smaller tax that targets a larger percentage of people is what's fair. A penny increase in the gas tax, or a 1/4 percent increase in sales tax is much more equitable than a large tax on the few.

Subject: BUDGET - CIGARETTE TAX

Comment: Our economy is tanking! How can the Governor consider a tax that will surely cost NC jobs? Why did she not speak up to protect our jobs during the Federal tax increase debate? Because we were told we cost more in health care, smokers paid for the "settlement". Now we are told we actually cost the Government less than non-smokers, but we continue to pay. We paid for the buyout - a program that kept domestic tobacco prices high, adding to the cost of cigarettes. They say smokers are addicts. How do addicts get money to pay the high price of street drugs? Is that what we want? I have been a strong Democrat all my life, supporting the Democratic ticket at all levels. If Democrats are willing to sacrifice NC jobs during a recession, we voters made a big mistake.

Believe me you, you will get voted out for doing that. The alcohol tax is OK since it causes people to black out, and die or kill others, but why did you only put .05 on it, but a lot more on cigs, when you know Obama is going to tax them too!!

Subject: taxes

Comment: Governor Perdue, I'm writing you in regards to the proposed tax hike in your new budget on cigarette and alcohol. This causes great concern to me and others that I have spoken with about it as it appears as if you are trying to open the door for furture reasons for taxation. As a transplant to Charlotte, NC from NY I know all about high and unfair taxes and I can tell you that they are the main reason for my relocation, sort of as a "political refugee" from the Democratically controlled NY. Your proposed budget is advertised as investing in our state by creating jobs, improving education, and increasing healthcare reform but I have heard nothing of cutting wasteful government spending programs, reducing the overall size of our budget, or trying to make any current programs more efficient. This is the main reason I see future tax hikes for outrageous reasons, you simply cannot afford your budget and have to produce the revenue from somewhere. Unfortunately government has NO means of production so ineveitably taxes will have to increase. Now I know that you may have good intentions but I urge you to rethink your decision as President Obamas new budget will already increase Americans tax burden before any increases you may have and quite frankly, the people are tired of you people thinking you can just throw a tax on something to get more money. I am in small business and if I want to stay operational I have to increase efficiency while finding new ways to create revenue. I can't for the life of me figure out why you people in office haven't figured out how to operate in this manner. Tobacco was one of the main reasons North Carolina came to be the great state that it is and now you want to further burden the very companies that have created so much revenue for this state, I don't see the logic. I fear your means of governing are going to have the same long term effects as New York has seen with a mass exodus of the citizens and business (both small and large)to flee a government that is ever growing and constantly needing more revenue to operate. In closing, I ask that you strongly reconsider your intentions with your budget, you and I both know that there is only so much hardship the people can take and by increasing the hardship, you WILL be losing popularity. Regards, Sean Brown

Subject: Raising taxes on Cigarettes

Comment: I have to express myself on this subject as I am one of many who have been laid off from a job of 5 years. Raising the tax on cigarettes is absolutely one of the worst things I think you can do to the already underpaid and out of work population we have here in NC.. Things are already tight financially in these households and now you want to add extra money burdens to them. Smoking is some people only vise that gives them a sense of relief. Most of these people who smoke in this state aren't the ones able to spend money golfing or going out to eat weekly even. This tax will either force some of these unemployed and/or low income people to take money away from their kids for the cigarettes or forcing them to quit which will make for a lot of unemployed and/or low income cranky people in this state. Yes, if they quit it will be good for the health insurance companies, but it will also result in not getting the proposed taxes you think the state will get from these already hurting individuals. So, in a way you are cutting your own throat by increasing these taxes which are used predominately by low-mid income households and our ever growing unemployed. Please consider this before hurting more of us little people. Try adding an extra tax to golf courses to help out the state or higher tax on entertainment in the state, etc.... Just think before going forward with this. Thank you !!

Comment: While I cannot in good conscience defend the use of tobacco, I do not understand the logic of crippling an industry that has given so much to our state. Taxing tobacco into bankruptcy is not a cure all for years of mismanagement so how can you expect it to bail us out now? If this tax passes, I'll vote next time, but it will not be for Beverly Perdue.

Subject: Budget

Comment: Governor Purdue, First of all, thank for your service to NC, and the sacrifices that are required to hold public office. For that we are truly grateful to you. We are also cognizant of the terrible budget situation you have inherited, and the tough choices that must be made to deal with this crisis. Our State will surely suffer without a balance budget. I must however point out that a cigarette tax hike of $1.00 per pack requires smokers to bear an unfair share of the revenue increases required to balance the budget. We would first like to see deeper cuts in government spending. Additionally, in proposing such, you are ignoring the fact that tobacco revenues in NC are not just derived from cigarette taxes. They are also derived from the family tobacco farms tax base, and tobacco industry workers. Raising the state excise tax just lowers your tax base on the other end, so the $1.00 a pack will not fully make its way into the State coffers. While desperate times may require desperate measures, fairness should still be a consideration of our leadership. Thank you for your consideration.

Comment: Something for the Governor to think about: ‚Äì More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution. and that‚Äôs not counting all of the other jobs and businesses affected when tobacco-related jobs are cut (e.g., unemployed workers buy less of everything else ‚Äì from milk and bread to cars and houses). ‚Äì Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 years. Apparently the Governor wants to drive that into double digits. ‚Äì The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C.

Cigarette taxes are paid by the "working poor." 55% of smokers are working poor. One in four smokers lives below the poverty line.

Subject: Cigarett Taxes

Comment: March 17, 2009 To: Governor Beverly Perdue From: Dewey Simms Mount Holly, N.C. 28120 Subject: Concerning your propose tax increase on Cigarettes. Let me first say that I am a Non-Smoker but what you are proposing is no more than the Boston Tea Party from the 1700‚Äôs and this was before the government of this country was formed. It is clearly a way for big government, to take advantage of the average person, and leaving all of us with out certain rights. If government can single out one group of people it surely will single out other groups for other taxes. I believe that smoking is bad for anyone who partakes of the substance and anyone who may come in contact with secondhand smoke. I also believe it is the right of any individual as long as they are not harming anyone else while in the process of smoking to be able to do so without unfair taxation. I am also a believer in banning all smoking in public places because at that point the smoker is taking away my rights as a non-smoker. Now on the other hand the next governor that is instated in North Carolina does not like basketball and he or she thinks that it a good opportunity to raise taxes on all the basketball games to pay for rising health care cost. Again you and any other governor is taking away the rights of people to close for the themselves what they want to do and they enjoy doing with unfair taxation no matter what you consider good or bad for that person. I personally fill that the lottery is bad for the state because so many people play the lottery that have not the money to play. But at the same time I know that it is the rights of the people to close for themselves what they want to do. I believe that if you raise taxes on tobacco that it is the right of all the people to share in the taxes no matter what type of products or groups of people and what people call a sin tax for others. I would ask that you go back and rethink this very unfair tax and come up with some better ways of taxing people that is fair and not steal from one group of citizens of this great state of North Carolina. You do not have the right to do so!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: Tax

Comment: I am so disappointed in you, to think you would raise the state cigarette tax to over a dollar. Do you have a brain at all? With tobacco being one of NC's highest resources and all the jobs you are putting at risk. Don't you think unemployment is high enough. Nc can't even afford to pay the people out of work now, how far back is it 2, 3 months. You are running this state straight to hell. I hope your stay in office is short lived if not i fear we may as well give up and die. Stupid, stupid, stupid, yes thats what you are. Thanks for nothing I hope you sleep well and I hope you recieved alot of money for this. Have a good day the rest of us won't.

Subject: Sin Tax

Comment: The sin tax increase is a very bad idea, all you are going to create is increased revenue for our surrounding states, because people will start driving there and buying their cigarettes and wine/beer. There will be no increased revenue..Think back to times before we had a state lottery, look at the revenue our surrounding states gained from the residents of NC.

Subject: Cigarette Price Increase

Comment: I find it outrageous that the new governor wants to raise prices on cigarettes on top of a price raise that just went into effect. With our economy in the shape it is in now, it is not the time to be raising taxes to give more to others. Some cigarettes are already above $46 per carton and you want to raise it $10 more? I think it is not wise to bite the hand that has fed NC for many years nor the customers who buy their products. On top of this, I understand the house is also constructing a bill in which smoking will not be allowed at any workplace. Outrageous.

Subject: Purdue Budget and implications

Comment: The budget that you have proposed as the North Carolina Governor contains an OUTRAGEOUS $1 A PACK TAX INCREASE on cigarettes ‚Äì AND an 18 percent tax increase on Other Tobacco Products (OTP). With this proposal, you alone are putting the 50,000 North Carolina jobs related to the tobacco industry at risk. I OPPOSE this tax increase, and it is an OUTRAGEOUS attack on jobs in our state. Who are you working for. Obviously not the American people. More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution. And that‚Äôs not counting all of the other jobs and businesses affected when tobacco-related jobs are cut (e.g., unemployed workers buy less of everything else ‚Äì from milk and bread to cars and houses). Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 years. Apparently you intend to drive that into double digits. The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C. And now you are adding to the problem. Economists predict North Carolina could lose 3,000 jobs as a result of the federal tax increase alone ‚Äì and that‚Äôs an increase of 62 cents a pack, compared with the $1 a pack increase you want. Washington D.C. and your cronies may not care about jobs in N.C., but we expect better judgment out of Raleigh. On April 1, the average retail price of a carton of cigarettes will be $44. If you have your way, that could be $55 by July 1st. That has a disproportionate negative effect on the ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù in our state. Cigarette taxes are paid by the "working poor." 55% of smokers are working poor. One in four smokers lives below the poverty line. Median family income of North Carolina smokers is $33,437. 80% of smokers make less than $75,000. How long will you keep killing the "Golden Geese" and "Tax cash cows" of Tobacco, Alcohol and Manufacturing in the US. They have been bled unconstitutionally for a long time now. They have no choice but to lay-off workers and/or move operations overseas. When ALL manufacturing is out of the country will you be happy. You will be the lone happy one, since most will be unemployed. Except you, who won't suffer, because we pay your bills. Wake up, just manage your expenses properly for once. You promised to help NC grow. This definately does not show that intent. Thanks for letting North Carolinians they made a BIG mistake voting you into office. Many diehard Democrats have seen the destruction of the Party and will be changing their registation. Don't count on the vote next election. We vote to improve our country not hasten it's demise.

Subject: Getting support

Comment: Raising tobacco prices is not helping anyone but yourself Bev!! It's a shame that you all claim to be helping the poor but it's the poor that wind up getting the short end of the deals and pays out more. Statistics show that lower class people smoke more than higher class people. And by you raising taxes on tobacco products is causing US lower class people to have to pay more for a habit we have trouble breaking. Besides, who are you to have the right to say that we the lower class people should quit smoking because you want to keep raising prices? You are profiling and showing your prejudice side by raising prices of something that affects a certain percentage of North Carolinians. Do you feel that it is fair? If you do your history on OUR state - you will find that it was tobacco that built this state. What gives you the right to try and change history? If you are going to change something - how about change it that will affect EVERYONE in the state instead of a certain percentage? It's you as well as the rest of the thick pockets in this country that only think about their own pockets. I know you sleep better knowing you are getting your share and the heck with everyone else right?!

Subject: Taxes

Comment: Ms. Perdue, Please reconsider your proposed tax increase on cigarettes. Not only will it make local smokers quit, you will obliterate small business with this tax~ Small farms, retail tobacco stores and convenience stores. What little you gain in tax revenue will quickly be eaten up with unemployment and government assistance for displaced workers. With that said, I do realize this is a typical *bait and switch* maneuver Democrats and Unions are famous for. Ask for something outrageous and then when you back down to a lesser amount, people sigh with relief and let it go through. Either way, you win. Perhaps a better course of action would be for you to forfeit your state salary and benefits, as well as everyone in your cabinet, until our budget is balanced? You could go further and ask county and city officials to do the same, remitting said salaries directly to the state coffers. You also have the option of downsizing your lifestyle and leading by example. Just this year our family has gone from $80,000 a year to $35,000 because of lay~offs. Wouldn't a governor making the same sacrifice as many in her state set a shining example? Our state has strong roots in our independence, not in government control. To drive our tobacco producers out of this state for pet projects is a recipe for disaster. When you are done playing bait and switch, and have your added tax revenue from tobacco, please remember that for most of us, SC and Virginia are a short drive away for products we want to purchase. Remember who you're hurting in the end. Leslie Warr Thomasville, NC. 27360

Subject: The so-called sin tax

Comment: Governor Perdue, The new tax on cigarettes and alcohol is extremely unfair to the people of low income and they can hardly afford the taxes that they have to pay now.(I am one of them) The new tax increase will make the crime level in NC go higher and some of the employee at stores that sells cigarettes could get hurt or killed because they will have to steal the cigarettes that they can not afford to buy anymore. My girlfriend works at a convenience store and I don't want anything to happen to her; SHE'S MY WORLD. Sin refers to something that is illegal and the last time I checked, cigarettes and alcohol was legal in NC. If you can get the people back to work; then the state will have the money it needs. I am just one voter that voted for you and please don't make me regret my vote. Sincerely, Edward Dishman Democrat, North Carolina

Comment: As a smoker I am sick of politicians who are unable to manage budgets taxing smokers to make up for their incompetency. Why is it fair to single out smokers to tax? Yes, I know it is unhealthy and I have tried several times to quit. Are smokers the ones who made a mess of the budget? No, we are not; so why do you sinle us out? It is totally unfair. Have you ever thought of what would happen if everyone quit smoking. Where would you go to get your money then? Probably increase an already unfair gas tax, or raise my state taxes, or raise the sales tax - again. How about doing what you all get paid too much to do now and that is manage the state budget responsibly.

Subject: Proposed Tobacco Tax

Comment: Governor Perdue, Thanks for the proposed RIDICULOUS tax hike on tobacco. I for one will quit, so that is about $720.00 plus all of the other taxes the Great State of North Carolina will no longer be getting from me. I am sure there are many others across the state that will quit also. Not only have you seen fit to stop many folks from smoking, but just think how many employees of the tobacco companies that will be out of work. You will fit right in with all of the tax crazy democrat governors from the past across our Great Nation. Our Great State of North Carolina has depended on one of our number one cash crops, tobacco for employment and you are attacking that cash crop. Think of the income taxes you are knocking in the head also from all that will loose their jobs, the taxes the stores pay to the state will also be effected. Think of the trickle down effect of your decision. TAX and SPEND. Grab funds from the schools that were paid in to the illegal lottery that you helped push through. How long do you think the voters in this state will support you? You just helped the next Republican candidate win the Governors seat for North Carolina. While speaking of grabbing monies, what about the Pittman Robertson Excise Tax that is collected from sportsmen and distributed to each state for wildlife that goes into the states general fund, instead of straight to Wildlife Commission like most other states? Another tax that is being proposed on boaters, by charging $100.00 to take a course on boating safety, or be fined if we do not pay the fee is ridiculous also. What is the purpose of the course? I realize that our country is in a deep recession. I also realize that we have to do something to change that around. But do you think over taxing is the answer?

Comment: I just heard you are planning to increase the cigarette tax. Give us a break. We are retired and have only been living in NC for 3 years. The one pleasure I have left is smoking and now you are going to raise the tax on that. Taxes here are unreal and we are sorry we ever moved here. Please rethink this. The economy is such a bad state and you politicians make it worse by raising taxes. As it is we have to pay tax on everything here and it's getting to be too much. We had hoped to spend our life traveling and enjoying things but paying so much in taxes have hampered that. Please stop already. Kids are going to smoke if they want no matter how much tax you charge. Give us smokers a break for a change. Everyone picks on us enough already. Please rethink this tax. I don't want to go in the poor house for my one and only vise. Thank you.

Comment: Hello Ms. Perdue Firstly, congratulations on winning the Governor's office last November. I'm sure that you will do what you think is best for the state. I heard this morning of your plan to raise cigarette taxes by $1 per pack - in tandem with the recent $.60 per pack imposed by the Federal government. We recently decided to move to North Carolina because of similar silly policies in Massachusetts. We will now keep on going - right to South Carolina. We've put up with 'tax and spend' leadership for far too long. Cigarette taxes are foolish - increase the tax, folks quit smoking, minimal net gain in state revenue. It distresses me to see you subscribing to 'more of the same' mentality. Whay can't you folks ever think 'outside of the box'? Goodbye and good luck. We're already packing and hope to move OUT of North Carolina before April 1. regards and best wishes - Matt and Ryta Lindi former potential residents

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue If the North Carolina government keeps raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. You are ask for the black market to show up in North Carolina and too show its ugly face,criminal would rob a store just for cigarettes and alcohol.Are you willing to take that chance of someone loosing there life over a carton of cigarettes or a bottle of alcohol.What about the tobacco companies moving out of the United States or the state of North Carolina more job lost.Think about the tobacco companies going out of business where would you get the (SIN)!!! tax money then... You are calling this sin tax how dare you call it sin tax,I believe that the state of North Carolina has a bigger sin to look at we are being tax to death now that's a SIN!!! from our government of North Carolina..... The rich will stay rich the poor will stay poor in North Carolina,THAT A SIN!!!! Check out some of the bigger companies too see if they have paid there fair share of back taxes..... Governor Perdue you don't have the stomach for that because of your friend's are in higher places... I help vote you in, I can help vote you out next time,that is a promise.... I have to make a tough decision in the next election....

Hello, just a note to let you know to stay away from cigaretts, pick on something that is not likly to backfire in your face. Try raising the fine for "DRUNK DRIVING" to say $3000.00, that might raise tons of money and might even save of life if they think twice before driving drunk on our roads.

Then you can stand up and support my idea to run the Red Light Camera's so we can teach our kids all they can learn.

But, you won't do any of this, cause it takes guts and a true sence of caring for the North Carolina people. Will you prove me right? Well, will you?

Subject: proposed budget

Comment: I have read the articles on your proposed budget for next year, and I am appalled. I can not believe that on top of the federal craziness of tax increases, our governor wants to add more. This is a tobacco state, and if this budget is passed, together with the federal increase, a pack of cigarettes will go up $2.00 a pack. I do not smoke, but my husband runs a country store that he started when both of us lost our jobs. THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE AND COUNTRY CAN NOT STAND ANY MORE TAX INCREASES TO BAIL OUT THE WORLD!!!! There is so much waste in this state. Just ride around and look at the Dept of Transportation employees. I have seen more times than just one a construction crew of maybe 9 to 12. Of those 9 to 12, only 5 or 6 are working and the others are standing on the side of the road watching. I have worked for a state agency, and know first hand of the waste. The puchasing practice of state agencies should be the first to be looked at. For instance, pencils can be purchased at Wal-Mart. But because they are not an approved vendor, pencils are purchased some where else at 3 or 4 times the cost. If you are going to tax "luxury items", make sure you include all of them, not just the ones you do not care for. Such as boats, rv's, motorcycles, SUV's, alchol (5% is not equal to the tax you want on tobacco products), etc. Governor Perdue, we voted you into office because we believed in you. I know your job is not easy, but you can not add tax to the people of this state. We can not afford it.

Subject: Proposed Cigarette Tax Increase

Comment: I am writing this email to express my opposition to the proposed cigarette tax of a $1 a pack. I know we are facing hard times right, but to raise taxes and to cause more job losses in North Carolina is not the way to solve this problem. I do not feel it is fair for one group of people to carry the burden for everyone. They are not the sole contributor to our economic problems or health care issues. I feel the same way about all the bailout money we are just passing out. People need to take responsibility for their actions and suffer any consequences of those actions and not rely on the government and the country to bail them out and to continue to earn huge bonuses. I sincerly hope you will reconsider this tax increase as this will have a tremendous negative impact on North Carolina and I would hope this is not what you would want for this state.

Subject: OPPOSE Cigarette tax

Comment: I am OPPOSED to any tax on cigarettes. I cannot believe you would raise taxes from 35 cents per pack to $1.35 per pack and place the cost on the consumer less able to provide this money. This is NORTH CAROLINA- home of the largest employers of tobacco. UNBELIEVABLE!

I am so disappointed that I voted for you. You want to raise taxes on cigarettes by 1.35 a pack! That is crazy and won't work as a revenue stream. If you jack up the costs fewer people will smoke resulting in less revenue. Take into account this statistic,
> "According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, a $1 per pack cigarette tax increase will produce a 17 percent decline in youth smoking, keep nearly 90,000 North Carolina kids from becoming addicted smokers, prevent more than 44,000 North Carolina adults from suffering a premature smoking-caused death"
There you can plainly see they expect 134,000 fewer smoker because of this tax. If they smoke on average 1/2 a pack a day that is $.675 times 134,000 people a day in lost revenue. That works out to $33 million dollars in lost taxes a year. Why don't you cut spending instead of raising taxes! It's not that hard, see I'm having a hard time myself, so I cut back on spending. See how easy that would be! If your goal is better health, then outlaw cigarettes if they are that bad! I managed to quit smoking 19 months ago without the incentive of a tax increase.
Now lets talk about the economic impact of an additional 90,000 jobs lost! That is the estimate reported on WXII. There is nothing good about this plan and I beg of you to stop it while you can! Try president Obama's approach, "You cannot raise taxes during an economic decline"

Subject: Tax

Comment: More than 50,000 jobs in N.C. are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution and that‚Äôs not counting all of the other jobs and businesses affected when tobacco-related jobs are cut (e.g., unemployed workers buy less of everything else ‚Äì from milk and bread to cars and houses). Unemployment in the state is at 9.7 percent ‚Äì the highest in 25 years. Apparently the Governor wants to drive that into double digits. The federal government just imposed the highest tax on cigarettes in history ‚Äì that alone put jobs at risk in N.C. And now the Governor is adding to the problem.Economists predict North Carolina could lose 3,000 jobs as a result of the federal tax increase alone ‚Äì and that‚Äôs an increase of 62 cents a pack, compared with the $1 a pack increase the Governor wants. Washington D.C. may not care about jobs in N.C., but we expect better judgment out of Raleigh. On April 1, the average retail price of a carton of Camels will be $44. If Gov. Perdue has her way, that could be $55 by July 1st. That has a disproportionate negative effect on the ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù in our state. Cigarette taxes are paid by the "working poor." 55% of smokers are working poor. One in four smokers lives below the poverty line. Median family income of North Carolina smokers is $33,437. 80% of smokers make less than $75,000. You Have Lost your Minds

Subject: Tobacco Tax Increase

Comment: To Governor Bev Perdue: I currently serve in the capacity of Site Manager for Alcan Packaging, in Reidsville, NC, Rockingham. Alcan Packaging is a major packaging supplier to the tobacco industry. As I am sure you are aware, Rockingham County has the highest unemployment rate in North Carolina. We currently have plans to expand our business, resulting in 30 additional job, increasing our employment to 134 North Carolina tax payers. The proposed $1 tax increase per pack, not only jeopardizes the addition of 30 employees, but the future of our business in North Carolina to include our current base of 104 and a cascading affect on our suppliers. We respectively request that you reconsider this proposal, and seek alternative means of offset the NC budget deficit. A large part of North Carolina's industrial history and economy were built in the tobacco fields. Respectively, Ron Perry

The new proposed tax is going to hurt nobody but the blue collar working man. This upsets me that all the government wants to do anymore is raise taxes to help the budget. You are the ones screwing up the budget find another way to fix the economy than raising taxes because it does not seem to be working!!!!!!!! Hopefully you read this if not it just figures I‚Äôm just another small working man that‚Äôs not heard.

Comment: Dear Govenor: The cigarette tax is insane: with job losses and the stress that most people have and the addiction of such taxing cigarettes now is just insane you will create more medical and mental issues and robberies with this move at this time. It would make more sense to tax toilet paper than this at this time. Leave the folks with stress and job loss some sort of enjoyment when they cannot go out to eat and other niceties that the wealthy continue to enjoy. This would be a very bad move on your leadership at this time .

Subject: NO to the $1 / Pack Tax Increase

Comment: I am writing to respectfully communicate my disappointment in the Governor's decision to raise taxed on cigarettes. The tax will have an adverse affect on jobs for North Carolina. As a supporter of the Governor and an employee of the tobacco industry, I am concerned with the Governor's choice of politics and the hypocrisy of her campaign message of "Creating Jobs" and this tax increase will only raise the unemployment rate higher than the current rate of 9.7%. Is the Governor not aware that the President has just passed a Federal Excise Tax rate increase of $0.62, with an estimated loss of 3,000 jobs? Is the Governor's intent to raise that number to over 7,000 jobs? Please reconsider the $1.00 a pack tax.

Dear Governor Perdue,



Please work to reject proposed increases in North Carolina tobacco taxes.†


I strongly oppose any tobacco excise tax increases because the idea is destructive to our hard-working citizens, and will certainly lead to even higher unemployment in our state. ††Taxes on tobacco users are already many times greater than those on non-tobacco users, and we the people should not inflict any more disproportional financial pain on the taxpayers who already pay more than their fair share for our government to exist.†



Increased taxes on tobacco will cause even more unemployment in NC, and weíre at about 9.7% already.† More than 50,000 jobs in our state depend on tobacco farming, manufacturing and distribution. ††Put this on top of the largest Federal excise tax increase on cigarettes in our history, $6.20 per carton, and I canít believe you would support another $10.00 per carton tax on cigarettes.† †This looks very wrong - please come to your senses. †



More tax on smokers is discrimination, and if our elected officials feel its good business to punish citizens who chose to smoke, especially in this great tobacco state of North Carolina, then we very obviously need to elect people who can see that this kind of tax strategy will clearly cause our state to self-destruct !† †



Please consider these facts and opinions, and fight against higher taxes on our hard-working citizens.† †Give us a break !† †



Please respond to this, and let me know how you intend to proceed on this issue.





Respectfully,



Marc

Dear Governor Perdue,
Thank you so much for the picture you sent, I really appreciate it, and
you are loved and admired by a lot of people, including me. I have a
gripe
about your proposed sin tax. I believe it's a good thing except, on the
alcohol. Myself, I am a smoker, it's nasty I know but maybe this will be
an incentive to me stopping. I like non-smokers don't like being around
it
when I'm eating, so absence in public places is a very good thing. I
don't even smoke when others are in my vehicle.I do my best to not
intrude
my habit onto anybody except myself.I do believe that all of the taxing
and regulations has put a lot of tobacco farmers out of business and in
some cases out of a home, that I don't agree with.As for the alcohol, why
only 5% ? When it's such a dangerous drug. Alcohol has ruined more lives
and homes than tobacco has. I know I'd rather pass an active smoker on
the road than an active drinker. As you know I am what I call a retired
alcoholic, I'm coming up on 15 years of sobriety, and am also a very
active member of MADD as a DWI court monitor in Watauga County.It's awful
and down right sad in some cases of the problems raised from alcohol.Next
week Juan Reyes is going to court for various serious charges including
2nd degree murder for killing a 19-20 year old young man and almost
killing the rest of his family. I bet they would rather he had been only
smoking, instead of drinking.It wouldn't have happened. Why is it so hard
for people to open their eyes to reality when it comes to drinking? I'm
not taking up for smoking. But I am wondering, when will the Government
take a stand on alcohol like they have smoking? Even High Schools harp on
smoking, and that's great, but none of them harp on alcohol that much,
only "drug abuse" they don't specifically target drinking. When usually
alcohol is where it starts. If it were up to me all of it would be
illegal
then we'd all have to stop, but it's not, so we must try to change it.
Thank you for your time, much appreciation, Ronnie

I am appalled that the governor would raise cigarette and alcohol taxes during a time like this.† From her ivory tower, can she not see that those of us who are unemployed and will likely remain that way for some time have few pleasures left in life?† Before she raises yet another tax higher than the national average (i.e.gas, sales) I would like to know if every single agency has been audited for embezzlement, tax payer funded luxury vacations, and unmonitored credit card use.† This state has been known to look the other way for some of these infractions, maybe millions could be saved or recovered if she looks to her own house before she interferes with ours.

One thing I know for sure:† This lifelong, committed democrat will vote republican next election.

Subject: Cigarette Tax - not a good idea right now

Comment: I don't necessarily disagree with the intent of the cigarette tax but with unemployment at an all time high doing anything that will lead to additional job losses in the state does seem like a good idea right now. Especially if the losses are in a manufacturing area where we can't replace them. What is the true real gain of this idea when you look at the lost tax revenue and state expense created by lost jobs?
