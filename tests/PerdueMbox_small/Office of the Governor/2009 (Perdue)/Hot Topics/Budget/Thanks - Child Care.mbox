Dear Governor Perdue:

On behalf of young children and their families in Western North Carolina, I want to thank you for your support of Early Childhood Education Services in the 2009-10 State Budget.  Thank you for your recognition of the importance of the investment in young children between the ages of birth to five.  Adequate high quality subsidized child care is critical for North Carolina, not only to support the working families of North Carolina, but for the development of tomorrow's workforce.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am the owner of a large child care center in Durham with over 70 children who receive subsidy as well as a More at Four classroom. On behalf of these children, I would like to thank you for not cutting our funding. It is reassuring to know that you recognize the importance of quality early childhood programs and the funding needed to maintain them.

Governor Perdue,

I want to thank you for your efforts to continue the funding for early childhood education services. As a former early childhood instructor and Smart Start Board Member for Gaston/Lincoln, I know that these funds are used directly to improve children's development.  I cannot imagine how difficult it was to determine the state's crucial funding needs.   

Currently, I work at Gaston College. After reviewing the budget  posted on your website, I appreciate your dedication to the community college system. 

Sincerely,

Wanda Wyont

Dear Governor Perdue,

As chair of the North Carolina Child Care Coalition, I want to thank you and your staff for the good job you did in creating a budget for our state that nurtures and protects our most precious seed corn, our young children. 



It is so important that our preschool children receive the kind of quality early care and education they are provided with Smart Start and More at Four.  We are also glad that more young, low income, working families will receive the child care subsidy that they need to continue to work.  That is critical to our state’s economic growth. 



Thank you for noting in your budget that most of those children are in 3 – 5 Star child care facilities.  Quality child care programs are key to preparing our young children to enter school ready to succeed.  Thank you for a budget that acknowledges the priorities for children.

Subject: SMART START BUDGET CUTS

Comment: This is a message for Governor Bev Perdue. I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your proposal to cut funding for the North Carolina smart start program, the assistance that I was receiving for my daughter ended. I believe that everything happens for a reason, but I'm having trouble accepting this. I would like to enlighten you to my situation. I am a single mother of a beautiful seven month old daughter. Her name is Andie Elizabeth and she is my world. Unfortunately her father is not involved and does not pay child support. I work full time for the Sheriff's Office in my county as a 911 telecommunicator. I love my job, and they have been wonderful working with my schedule so I can continue to work there. I have also needed assistance with daycare, so that I can continue to work. I make just over $30,000 a year, which is a good salary, but not enough to really support my daughter as far as childcare is concerned. She attends Greenway Childcare Development Center. I absolutely love the staff and do not want her to stop going. Of course, I also donâ€™t want to have to quit my job and apply for welfare. The cost per week is $165. That equates to approximately $660 to $825 per month. I make too much money to qualify for any programs offered by DSS, short of the subsidy that I was receiving from Smart Start. I received a letter from DSS on the 10th of March advising me that the funding would end on the 20th of March. They said that legally they only had to give me two weeks notice. The letter was printed on the 6th of March, mailed on the 9th, and not received until the 10th. Iâ€™m not a mathematical expert but I hardly consider that two weeks. As far as the two week rule is concerned, it may be legal to only give a parent two weeks notice, but ethically it is wrong to not give more time. As a single mother, working full time, and not receiving child support it is mind blowing that I don't receive any aid. The only aid that I was eligible for was this program; not wic, not the Babylove program, no assistance with health insuranceâ€¦nothing. It is disheartening that children of aliens are now getting more help from the American government than a tax paying citizen. On top of that the local DSS office is more concerned with telling you their personal problems than helping you with yours. If I'm not mistaken, their job is to help people, which is a task at which they fail miserably. I know you canâ€™t control othersâ€™ actions, but you can control your own. I regret that I voted for you and will be sure to let everyone I know that a dysfunctional & unfair system that rewards you for not working, is even more screwed up thanks to your proposal. Please keep my daughter and I in your prayers because I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to come up with over $400 more a month.

I would personally like to thank you for protecting NC children and NC childcare workers with your new budget. I own a large childcare center in Harnett County and we also do More@ Four and your budget means so much to us. I have thirty two employees that will keep their jobs and 175 sets of parents that will also not have to worry about childcare. Most of our children are subsidized thur Smart Start and DSS and our parents could not work with out this help.



Again Thank You,

Dear Governor Perdue,



Thank you for excruciating work done by you and your staff in creating the proposed biennial budget.  As a provider of services for preschool children with disabilities and a member of the NC Childcare Coalition, I believe this budget is as fair and balanced as it could be in terms of early childhood services.  Doing the right thing for very young children is not just a “touchy-feely” kind of thing, it also makes excellent long-term economic sense.  Credible studies indicate that two years of quality early care and education will save over $250,000 per child over a lifetime in costs related to remedial education, welfare, incarceration, and violence-driven medical cost.  Former Hewlett Packard CEO Lewis Plant estimates that for every $1 invested in preschools, there is an annual return of $7.  The business community is catching on.



Thanks for your support for early childhood services.  It is a GREAT business decision.
