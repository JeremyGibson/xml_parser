Subject: Longevity pay

Comment: I have been an employee of the state of North Carolina for over 29 years. It is this year that I plan to retire and counted in my retirement plans are to pay off my visa which is with the logerty that I counted on and expect at my retirement date. When I was first hired with the state I was told to expect a five percent pat raise until I reached top pay. After 29 years. I haven't came close to top pay for the position I carry. Now it appears again I will be cheated by the state with pay the I was promised through the year. I could see if it was put from june or july when the budget goes into effect that we can no longer count on that money but not when It has been included into my pay from this time until the budget is passed. I need windows on my house should I say I plan on not paying my tax when it's due to put windows in my home. That money is due me and I feel strong even by a law suit that I am entitled to my pay. Fair is fair.

                        A user with email address of Dpsessoms@ncdot.gov submitted the following question. 



                        I do not understand why the State Employees have to always pay a major

price at budget time.  If you take away our longevity pay for two years,

you are doing a great injustice to State Employees and Teachers.  State

Employees' pay is always on the chopping block at budget time and every

year we take a beating where other CEO's and Administrators in colleges

like our previous Governor's Wife get all the perks.  Where is all the money from the lottery going and why do the already underpaid State Employees have to suffer every year???  This note is from a very frustrated and angry State Employee who works very hard every day and to hear that my longevity pay is going to be taken, makes me wonder even more why I should be so dedicated.

Comment: I am an employee of 23 years and have looked forward to my longitivity pay for many years. I realize that cuts should be made, but why are the most loyal, long-time employees being targeted? Incoming state employees are coming in making as much as the employees that have been here for numerous years. Also, when will the longitivity freeze go into effect? Thank you.

Subject: State employee tax

Comment: Why do we feel that it is ok to "tax" State employees? In addition to raising our deductible, now we're losing our longevity?! You're taking money directly out of the pockets of the people that serve the State to balance the budget. How is that fair? Why should State employees have to shoulder this burden? If you want to save money for the State Health Plan, start by not giving every legislature healthcare for life just for serving one term! Year after year you turn to us to shoulder more of the burden. The idea that we're going to take money from State employees is unfathomable and extremely disappointing, especially when the budget reflects an increase? Unbelieveable.

Governor Perdue,

Your proposed budget suspends employee longevity and replaces it with bonus time. Last time I checked, I couldn&#700;t find a store anywhere that accepted bonus time as a form of payment. WOW! You went for state employee's throats faster than Mike Easley did when he took office. Bare with me...it's hard to type with this knife in my back! Please explain why every new governing body attacks the very backbone of the state's success? Please explain why budget shortfalls have to fall on the employee's shoulders? If I balanced my checkbook like the government balances the budget, I would be in jail or sleeping under a bridge! Shouldn't basic math skills be a requirement when elected to positions responsible for managing tax payer's money? If the government eliminated all of the waste, taxes could be cut in half. How many millions are spent every year on emergency medicaid to dialyze illegal aliens and non-compliant drug addicts and alcoholics? How many millions are funneled into assistance programs every year that only promote government dependency? What about the millions and millions spent on pet projects that serve no purpose other than to spend tax payer's money without a conscience? The government goes through money like it's candy and suddenly, when it's all gone, state employees pay the price! Do you know what it is like to worry from day to day about how to keep the roof over your head and food on the table? I didn't think so. When you don't have much to begin with and the government keeps taking and taking, where is the incentive to try? How do you plan to replace the revenue from cigarettes when everyone quits smoking because the cost sky rocketed from taxes or smoking is banned totally? The government doesn't have the foresight to see that coming! The two positions you recently filled would have employed about six average salaried people. Did they really have to be paid that much? Exactly what do they do, guard dangerous prisoners or dodge traffic while patching a road? No! They will never get their hands dirty and, these are the same people who will never notice the ridiculous proposals that greatly effect employee&#700;s pay, health insurance and morale. I wonder what this will do for recruitment and retention efforts? Do you think people will be lined up for miles just to get a crack at government employment? It&#700;s time to start taking care of the people who take care of North Carolina.


Respectfully,
Citizen, Taxpayer, Employee and Voter

Subject: State Budget

Comment: I've been employed as a school teacher in North Carolina for 12 years now. I became eligible for longevity pay the past 2 years. Based on what was said on WRAL news tonight you are freezing longevity pay. It seems as though any time government makes cuts to save money it ends up affecting middle class people like me. I thought you were for education and teacher retention. Now you want to put a freeze on our salary? Does not make sense to me. I'd like to see government make some cuts at the top. Start looking at administrative positions in education. I'm sure you could save more money by looking at the salaries and benefits some these people have instead of making cuts at the teacher level. We are the ones in the classroom working directly with the students on a daily basis trying to educate them. Yet it seems as though we are valued the least.

Mrs . Perdue I am embarased to call NC home when I see a budget as I did today WHY are state employees asked to give up their longevity that they were promised when they were hired and get no pay raise and I see teachers getting a 1.8% raise is this state crazy, do you not consider every employee a state employee or do we have state employees and "teachers" I can't believe in this economy a certain group is getting a raise and the others that get the slap in the face every year are asked to give up their benefits you all are all ready after their health insurance and now this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS LUDACRIS I hope you remember who worked all night clearing your roads on 2 or 3 occasions it was not teachers i wish for once that state employees treat you all like you treat them and the next time it snows just leave the roads a mess and give you all a little payback but if they did they would all be layed off and the teachers would probaly get another raise this is your first year and already the same but if it continues to go this route you will not get another vote from me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Comment: Governor Perdue, In all due respect, please tell me that you are not proposing a "freeze" on longevity pay for teachers? As a teacher, in a school system that no longer offers 12-month pay option, I depend on this money to get me through the long summer months without a paycheck. I know that I am not the only teacher that feels this way, because I have discussed this issue with many others. We are feel that this will be detrimental to an already low teacher morale. Please reconsider this option in your budget plan. Many families depend on this small check for survival during the summer months. Thank you. William Hartman

                        I am very upset after voting for you Governor Perdue seeing  your plans to do me a great injustice as a  veteran state employee of 22 yrs and 6 months.  My longevity is all I have to look forward to and is used not for enjoyment but for expenses that come up every year at that time.  What do I have to look forward to now losing my property because I will no longer have this money.  you can find out ways to fix the budget besides taking away from those of us who have given this state many years of dedicated service.  I am really trying to see why so many other things are being brought forth to grow N.C. like a magazine??? ref.inmates  and whatever and those of us that serve and protect and keep the inmates in custody fall in with  the many who will suffer if you take our longevity. Please consider this at last result, can't afford to lose this money

Subject: proposed State Budget

Comment: The problem I have is that in your proposed budget you are providing for employees with 10 or more years of service extra bonus leave. Do you not feel that the State employees that have been with the state less than 10 years are just as important to the continuous functioning of the daily operations. Why are they being completely left out. For me that is like a slap in the face. In my opinion, if you can't do for all state employees, then you shouldn't do for any.

Comment: I'm Ellie Aycock, i have worked for the school system for 16 years. I think it is crazy to freeze our longgivity pay. We work hard each year to recieve this for our years of service. If Perdue is "a big girl" she should cut her pay and leave ours alone. Cut her 3% spending increase. How wil this help our economy? If she wants to "cut" things, why not cut all these "big dogs" in the central offices, her office and other places that make 6 figures and more? It won't hurt them but doing this to "us" will surely hurt us.I didn't think Perdue would have been the way she is, but yes i did....they all try to sound good to get in office to get the big bucks !!! She should work for what we work for and then let us cut out her money. Thanks for your time, Ellie Aycock

Comment: Why do you continue to penalize the state employees?? Longevity is the only "bonus" that we receive and now you are proposing to freeze it. Do you not realize how much that will hurt our pocketbooks??? As an employee of the school system, it is unbelievable that you would even suggest taking it away from us. What is even more revolting is that you are proposing a raise for teachers but not for the support staff. Who keeps the teachers going???? The support staff that are treated like 2nd class citizens!!! We do not receive ABC bonuses when teachers and their assistants do but yet we are required to keep the school running by keeping the office running. If anything, you should reward your classified employees and not give the teachers a raise. We work just as hard as they do!!!!

Subject: Proposed Budget

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am outraged by your budget proposal. As a University state employee of 14 years, I find it unacceptable that the budget YET AGAIN contains an increase for the teachers, none for the REST of the state employees, and the freezing of longevity pay. I don't mind giving up my longevity pay as long as the there are no increases for a separate class of employees. How can anyone suggest ANY raises for ANYONE in these budget times is completely beyond my capacity to understand. I am unwilling to accept that I have to give up part of my compensation pay while the teachers receive a pay increase. Please note that once again, the Governor's office for over 8 years now is creating a separate class of state employees who continually get preferential treatment. I can completely accept no raises but not a cut in state employees compensation while giving a pay raise to another class of state employees. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! Respectfully, Nili Clifford

I have endured years without cost of living increases, I've endured salaries that don't come close to that which my counterparts in the private sector make. I've put up with these things because I enjoy working for the state, and I've been told year after year that the longer I work here, the better the state will reward me for my loyalty. So now, after twelve years, I understand that your budget includes a freeze on longevity pay. I know that $340 is nothing to you, but for me, it's the difference between living in the house that I have inhabited for nine years or losing it. So I have a question: When I lose my house after the state to which I have dedicated my professional life robs me of the much needed money that I have earned and been promised, can I come stay in your mansion? Thanks for your time.

Governor Perdue,

Thank you for standing up to the big tobacco lobby with your $1.00 cigarette tax proposal.
It's about time NC gets in line with the rest of the country.

I hope and pray that HB 2, Prohibit Smoking in Public and Work Places is passed. I play music for a living and know for a fact that my health is jeopardized every time I go to work.

Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Ron Brendle

Governor Perdue,



Before I go on my bandwagon I would like to clarify your current proposal to freeze employee longevity payments.



Does this mean we will not receive longevity payments or will we receive payments at the current rate?   



Thank you for your response.

Subject: Longevity and bonus leave for teachers

Comment: Dr. Gorman sent a budget report today stating the request for a two-year freeze, beginning in 2009-2010, to teacher and state employee longevity payments. Non-certified staff will get bonus leave that equates to what their longevity payment would have been since they will not receive a salary increase next year. Is this really in your budget proposal? What about rewarding teachers who have been dedicated to their job for ten years or more? Do you want to punish teachers for their dedication? I personally disagree with this part of your proposal and believe it needs to be reconsidered! -A teacher about to receive longevity

Subject: Opposing Longevity Pay Freeze

Comment: I have heard that as part of the new budget proposal freezing the Longevity Pay of State Employees is under consideration. As a teacher in the NC Public Schools - where year after year we are asked to do more and more with fewer resources - I have to voice my opposition to the proposal to freeze Longevity Pay. Teachers are asked on a daily basis to do so many things - teach, nurse, counsel - I could go on and on about the many hats we wear. Freezing one of our financial benefits at a time where there is talk of us having to start paying part of our health insurance, where many teachers have spouses who have lost their jobs, when teachers are spending more money out of pocket to help needy students in their classrooms have the most basic supplies would be a disservice to those serving the children of North Carolina. I hope you will reconsider the freeze on Longevity Pay. Respectfully Yours, Kellie Capps, M.Ed., NBCT

Subject: Stopping Longevity Pay for 2 Years

Comment: Gov Bev Perdue, State employees don't make alot of money now. We've worked hard and many years to earn our longevity pay and have come to depend on it for college money for our children, home repairs, emergency money and/or extra money to get us through tough times. It takes money to stimulate the economy and evidently we will be receiving less. What were you thinking? Very Disappointed in my Vote, Sherri Roper

Subject: Longevity for teachers

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing, repectfully, to please ask that you reconsider freezing longevity payemnts for teachers. I am one of your 25 year veteran teachers. I am also a single mom with a son in college and one entering college in the fall of 2009. I rely HEAVILY on my longevity payment that I have received in December for the past 15 years. That money is earmarked for college funds that have to be made before the end of the month. I don't know how I will replace that money if it is taken away from me. I am also very discouraged that my value as a veteran teacher is so easily dismissed. I feel like all my years of hard work and dedication are not being rewarded as it is, but especially when I have earned those years of longevity and the monetary appreciation that comes with it. I LOVE my job as a first grade teacher. I realized many years ago that what I received through the gift of teaching was far more than the money I could make elsewhere. But, I appreciate every single dime I receive and I EARNED it. Please Please Please...reconsider this part of the proposal. I have been so down today thinking about how this action could affect my sons' college careers. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a Blessed Day Beverly Dees Lake Wylie Elementary Charlotte, NC beverly.dees@cms.k12.nc.us

Subject: Budget Cuts

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue I know you have to make budget cuts in Education for the State but please try not to hurt the classified people. The salaries in this school system are already so low and I think cutting the longevity, rumored, for classified would be a blow to us, yet again. Our salaries were frozen in past years and that threw us back about 10 years, now there is rumor that our longevity may be at stake. A lot of us are single and one income is all that we have to rely on. I believe cuts in other areas such as,top level administration would be more beneficial. They may not feel the pinch, but we will certainly be bruised from it. Thank you for listening.

Subject: Teacher Longevity Pay

Comment: I have been teaching for 25 years. I look forward to receiving my longevity check every March. It helps me pay taxes, which in turn, help North Carolina. I was quite disturbed today, when I read in the Winston Salem Journal, that Governor Perdue was considering eliminating teacher's longevity pay, as a way to save money in the budget. I can adamantly say this is a huge mistake. I am extremely disappointed in her thinking of this as an option, as I voted for her and thought she would do positive things for teachers. I can assure you that cutting a teacher's longevity is not the approach to take. Teachers in my school have been discussing the possibility that we may have a salary freeze, as we did several years ago, but not taking away pay from one of our benefits. I would encourage Governor Perdue to think long and hard about cutting the fat in people who have jobs that are not productive or letting go those people who are pulling their weight, but not taking away teacher longevity pay. There are alot of teachers who would rise up and revolt, if this were to be seriously considered. I hope she will reconsider this and take it off the table as a budget cut.

Governor Perdue I am quite concerned about your proposal to suspend of longevity pay for teachers for 2 years.  I helped start up Cape Lookout Alternative School in Carteret County and met you on several occassions. I have been a longtime supporter of you and your support of education and educators.  I ask that you rethink this proposal. I am shocked and concerned that our ranks would have to pay for the economic downturn.  Administration officials in education and the government make large salaries compared to teachers.  My raises have been minimal for the past several years.  The one thing I and other teachers have to look forward to is our longevity bonus.  Why not withhold ABC money, or reduce the salary of the top officials in the state, as well as the legislature?  Why hurt the very people who are innocent bystanders of this economic debacle?  I have had to supplement my job for years as a waitress.  I have accepted the lower pay with a smile and remain committed to my profession.  But your proposal is a slap in the face to those who toil uncomplaining for small salaries.    Please help us.  I have taught in North Carolina for 23 years knowingly working for pay far less than my northern counterparts.  We do not need to be the ones to pay for this shortfall.  Thank you for your time.

In the governors budget proposal she  proposed not giving state
employees their longevity pay for two years,  I hope  she and the
state legislators would reconsider that idea, a lot of state employees 
like myself
depend on  this money to help pay county taxes and to fill the
oil barrels for the coming winter.  When would this start?
If it starts with the new budget year some state employees have
already received their longevity checks and some have not.

Subject: PAY FREEZE

Comment: Madam Governor, I agree that drastic measures should be taken to balance the budget. However I think the legislature should bear the brunt of the burden as they are the ones who mispent and over appropriated the genral fund. Why havent you called on them to taken a 7 % reduction in their budget as you have other agencies. A suspension of the per diem alone would make a substantial savings to the state. Just having them finish their session on time would save thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. I dont mind sharing the pain..but lets all share, legisltors and teachers included. You cant justify give them a cost of living raise without the rest of the state getting it also. Its all or none. If layoffs are mandated...fine but we all suffer your office included. You promised change and transparency. Lets see it. Thanks for listening Kelly Rhodes

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue. It is with great respect that I send this email. As you are well aware, teaching is a wonderful and stressful job. Because of No Child Left Behind we have lost many good teachers. We are fortunate to still have several good teachers still hard at work. I am a second year teacher, but I was an assistant for 14 years before I recieved my degree and started teaching. Many things haave been taken away from us. Please, do not add to our already hard times. I ask that you do not proceed with the idea of freezing our longevity pay. Thank you for your time.

Comment: Governor Perdue, It has been brought to my attention that you have put before congress, a bill that would freeze and not allow longevity pay for state employees for the next two years. My husband and I are both educators. This bill would be taking around three thousand dollars from my family. This is money we depend on to pay our taxes, insurance, and for Christmas. I would like you to reconsider and think about the families that have two parents working for the state and how that will effect them and their children. Sincerly, Sherry Montague

Subject: Longevity For State Employees

Comment: I am a teacher assistant at Liberty Elem. in Liberty N.C. I have been an assistant for 13 years. I understand that the economy is in crisis now but to freeze our longevity is not the best way to cut costs. While I am blessed to have a job while so many others in our state do not, I truly believe teachers and assistants deserve this money. We are asked to do so much each day and are certainly not paid any more to do so. Please seriously consider the messages that many of us teachers and assistants have left for you and do not freeze our longevity. We are educating the youth of tomorrow--TODAY!! Thank you for your time.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am one of may teachers in North Carolina who supported your bid for governor. It was your many promises that lead us to do so. We feel that you have turned your back on us. The longevity pay issue stings. How is it fair to have given longevity to some teachers and then freeze it before others receive theirs? This does not seem morally nor legally sound. I was due to receive my longevity pay in April. What does this mean for me? I can say that if we do not see this, it most likely means lost votes for you should you decide to seek another term in office. I await your reply. Signed, Seriously Disappointed in Elizabeth City

Subject: new budget

Comment: I would like to know if you could clarify part of the new budget. It is the part where teachers longevity payment is frozen for two years. Does this mean it does not increase for the next two years or does this mean that the teachers that have dedicated the most time (more than 10 yeras) will recieve that a 2% raise (like everyone else), just to turn around and have it taken away by not getting (the promised) longevity payment. Because this would mean the only teachers not getting a raise are the most experienced and the most dedicated. I would like clarity on this because I am a teacher and there seems to be some confusion. Thank you for your time.

Subject: longevity

Comment: I think it would be unfair to take away money that is part of our pay. Do you take away money from everyone or just the teachers with 10 years experience or more? If you take away our money then you should take away the same amount of money from everyone who is in the work force. It is unfair to target our pay more than anyone else's pay. We are already underpaid for the hours we put in, voluntarily, taking papers home and doing planning at home. We do not even get a proper lunch because we have to sit in the cafeteria daily with approximately 200 students. Have you ever tried to digest a lunch in the cafeteria with 200 students for 180 days a year? I believe we earn everything we get and deserve more. I teach not for the money but for the personal satifaction I get when I see the light bulbs go off inside the heads of these wonderful children I teach. However, I firmly believe it is unfair to take away the longevity.
