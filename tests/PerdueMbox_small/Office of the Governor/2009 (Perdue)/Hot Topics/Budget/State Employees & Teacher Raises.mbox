Subject: Furlough for NC Educators

Comment: Madame Governor: In an economic time such as this, I do understand the need to cut back on spending in all areas, but it seems to me that when cuts are made the first place that officials look is in the area of Eduction. Why is this? Each year, educators in our district sacriice when parents fall short, the system lacks in classroom funds, and students are unable to pay fees for lunch, supplies, and materials, why should we sacrifice again when it comes to our salaries? Yesterday, educators in my area were asked to furlough, yes, give up a day without pay. Is it not enough that the funds allocated for Education from the lottery were sacrificed to cushion the deficit of the State budget? I think both of these statements are examples of great sacrifice. How much more do we need to sacrifice?

Subject: Teacher Assistant / Reading Tutor Pay

Comment: Dear Madame Governor Perdue: I have just read where you are wanting to increase an additional $350 million to the K-12 Schools in the state. My wife has been employeed by the Rowan-Salisbury Schools since 1980 as a teacher assistant, reading tutor, and one-on-one assistant except the years 1994-98 when she stayed home when our daughter was born. This year she will complete her 24th year in the system. She has a AS degree from Wingate and a BS from Applachian State which are both are in early childhood education. We have just taken our taxes to the CPA and her 2008 W-2 is for $20,396.00. I was making more than this back in the early 80's at a small company. I don't know if the other systems pay their assistants the same or better but the assistants in this state deserve more pay than they are receiving. Char-Meck has their salaries on line and some of their assistants are making up toward $30K. With the additional monies from the lottery and this additional funding it looks like we could give these employees a decent raise even though we are having tough financial times. Since their pay was finally set at pay grade 56 even the new hired assistants make almost as much as the ones that have been there all of their lives. There has been 9 bills written over the last 19 years for the teacher assistants pay to be put on a pay scheldule like the teachers have. These bills have never made it out of the committee though.I think it is high time that we help these people out and quit getting their hopes up each time the General Assembly meets. Thanks, Tom Corriher

Subject: Budget Cuts

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, I was encouraged when I went online and saw an outline of your proposed plan today. Please don't allow cuts to be made in education. As a Teacher's Assistant, I don't make a large amount of money. I get my joy from knowing that I am helping educate the next leaders of our great state and our great country. I love my job, and I love our kids! I work along with at least 12 other fine assistants who feel the same. Please keep us in mind when you make this tough decision. I would rather pay a little more in sales taxes, and still have a job. Thank you so much for letting me share this with you. Sincerely, Ginger Mullis

Subject: New Budget and State Employees Pay

Comment: As I listen and read about the new budget proposal that is being promoted the past day or two, there is one question that is burning in my mind. I am a 25 year State employee, and do realize that we will not see any kind of salary increse this year (and probably not for the next two or three if one is honest about it). However, the grand talk is about the education budget not being in any trouble of being reduced. Please do not let it be that teachers get a raise this year with so many others having to make great sacrifices!!!!!! Yes we need teachers, but they are no more deserving of raises this year than any other State employee. Should this be the case (that teachers get a raise and other State employees do not) it will be a complete tragedy and a total morale buster!!! A response is greatly appreciated.

Subject: State Budget

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I want to thank you for your addressing the budget shortfall for our state. I realize that the revenue shortfall must be addressed. I do however feel that the proposal to raise educator’s salaries and not other state workers is not right. The budget last year gave educators a much larger increase than non-educators. I feel that if any of us should be asked to sacrifice we all should be asked to do so. To elevate educator’s salaries and not other state employees indicates that somehow educators are valued more than others and, I believe, send the wrong message. Please revue your recommendations and reconsider what this budget is saying about the other dedicated state workers. Cordially, Ronald Michalowicz

Subject: State employee pay level freeze

Comment: As support personnel for a public school system, I was concerned with the proposal to eliminate step increases for non-teacher and non-upper administration school employees. On a daily basis we (secretaries, bookkeepers, bus routing clerks, etc.) are the employees that provide a face for the public. We work diligently to ensure concerns are addressed and that we are operating as efficiently as possible. While I understand that the position of teacher is an important one, why is it that the the support staff who handles the day-to-day operations is not rewarded for efficiency? Like everyone in the Nation at the moment, NC state employees are supporting their families to the best of their abilities. Many of us now support the entire household on a single income. Eliminating the longevity pay and freezing the step increases for some employees creates a significant hardship. In the current economic climate, any assistance is appreciated. Please consider some sort of financial support for the employees that keep things running smoothly so we can continue to provide excellent service to the State of NC and basic care/ support for our families.

Comment: Don't understand during a time when everyone in the private sector is taking pay and benefit cuts that the budget is going to provide teachers with a raise, while all the other state employees are not getting a raise.During such a terrible economic time how can we afford to treat the teachers better than all the other state employees. It seems to be typical over the years to treat the teachers better than every one else so why should I be surprised.I personally have taken a pay and benefit cut and was hoping that my wife who has worked for the state for 29 years would not be affected but it looks like longevity is going to get withheld but teachers still get a raise. I just don't agree.

Subject: No increase for State Workers

Comment: To Beverly Perdue, Governor of the State of NC: I am appalled at the fact that your budget is going to provide raises for teachers and not for state workers. With the economic conditions of the state, state workers especially in the Employment Security Commission Department are working harder than they have ever worked assisting the unemployed citizens of this state. They work tirelessly to make sure people are having some way to assist their quality of life. How can you give to one group and not to the other? State employees are just as important as the teachers of this state. If the teachers of this state are so good, why do a lot of unemployed persons younger than 40 have educational handicaps. Most can't write or spell or speak good English. I voted for you because I felt you would keep your promises and you believed in equality. By not providing salary increases for state workers seems quite unequal. State employees are just as vital and important as teachers. I hope that you reconsider your decision. As a State employee, I need an increase to meet the high prices of utilities, housing, food, etc. Teachers are not special citizens. Yours truly Stephanie H. Workman

Comment: I am writting to you in the hopes that you will consider the fate of state employees. We are a very hard working group, yet we normally get the short end of the stick. We are required to come to work at the drop of a hat so to speak, If something happens on or to our highways at 2:00am who gets up to help? The weatherman says 6-10 inches of snow. We are the ones that work 24 to 36 hrs straight because job cuts have left us short handed. Please help us, we make barely enough to survive, yet we are about to take yet another hit. We can't afford higher premiums, co-pays, and higher presciptions. Mrs. Perdue why do you want to cut 1400 more jobs. Who is going to push the snow off the roads next year if there wasn't enough of us to do it this year? Thank you for reading this and please, please, please, consider us .

Why in the world would she not give pay increases to these people also? This is a shame. Now I know I will die making $11.15 an hour. Good grief.

Subject: Protecting Teachers

Comment: Governor Perdue, I wanted to thank you for your comments recently about vowing to protect North Carolina's teachers. As a teacher in Wake County, I am very happy to hear that efforts will be made to do everything possible to keep as many of employed as can be. Although my future is uncertain, I feel relatively confident that I will have a job next year. There are many other hard working, well qualified people who do not share that confidence, though. It is amazing that we live in the fastest growing area in the country and the possibility of losing teachers exists. This is failure on the highest level, one that teachers did very little to bring on. Although I don't pretend to understand the total cause of this crisis we are in, I do know that it is greed that got us here. Teachers are the antithesis of that - taking below average wages to work in difficult situations. We make a difference, and that is enough for us. So I guess my one request is that you continue to do your part to protect us in every way possible so that the future of North Carolina can be as bright as the sun that shines over it. Thank you and best of luck through these difficult times.

Comment: Why is it that the classifed employees are always the ones that do not get recognized by the State? If we did not come to work at a school just one day, the school would maybe see what a very important part our job is. The schools could not run without the treasurer, front office secretary, guidance secretary, SIMS person, Testing Coordinator, custodians, bus drivers, etc. A TEACHER CANNOT TEACH WITH THEIR SUPPORT STAFF.....US! Do not let us be forgotten in 2009-2010 when you are deciding we deserves a raise.

Comment: I am outraged by the proposed $1.00 cigarette tax. I don't understand how putting 3000 employees in the traid area out of work stimulates the economy. Have the cigarette companies not suffered enough? They are suppling a product, which people choose to use. My suggestion is to tax a product which is made overseas. Why are politicans so determined to terminate this industry? We need this industry to remain open...in the United States.

Subject: Pay raise for Teacher Assistants

Comment: I do not think it is fair to give teachers raises and not the classified staff. As a classified staff member, our pay has been frozen many times over the years. Many of our classifieds are not even up to the standard of some of the newer employees coming in because of salary freezes on the older employees from the early years. Is there not a compromise that we can come to to help everyone? I know you have a tough job in this hard economic time, but just wondering if there is another way.

Subject: School Employee Raises

Comment: Gov. Perdue, This email is being sent in regard to the information received stating that teachers in NC would be considered for raises, but Classified Employees will not receive raises. My current position is Technology Instructor in a PK-5 computer lab. I do lesson plans and instruct up to 7 classes daily on a classified salary. In years past I too have been a teacher assistant in a classroom and know well the tasks these individuals have to perform. Many teachers have planning time, whereas classified employees are so stretched they have to sneak in a restroom break. Middle and High School teachers teach 3 classes daily with a 90 minute planning as well as a 30 minute lunch. Assistants and other staff are used to cover cafeteria duty for these teachers. It is my opinion that classified staff work as hard and many teachers for half the pay, because many do not have degrees and do not want the stress of being a teacher for one reason or another. Please consider these individuals as you are planning your budget and pay raises. Thanks, Kammy White

Subject: Same % Raise for Licensed and Classified Staff

Comment: I am a teacher and appreciate the rasie I am about to receive. I have tuition bils, mortgage bills, and cost of living expenses. Any additional monies is welcome. I also feel that classified staff should also receive the same percentage raise as teachers. They work hard beside us and contribute equally hard to our schools to help make them a safe learning environment for students. The cost of living went up for them just like it did for teachers. Classified staff do not earn close to what teachers are paid, so it is even more important that they receive a raise to assist in their living expenses. Thank you for listening.

Subject: Teacher pay and benefits

Comment: I am a teacher in Columbus County Schools. Two years ago I left Horry County Schools and took a $9000/year pay cut to come back and work for NC. I have licensure in 2 areas, a master's degree, 13 years of experience in special education, and National Board Certification. I have taught elementary, middle, high school, alternative schools, day treatment centers, and at NC State University. I feel as though I contribute a great deal to the education of NC students. However, I have to say that I am very displeased with the proposed cuts in our benefits. NC is not exactly the highest paid state for teachers, but I have always been happy with the benefits packages offered. I have 3 children and we participate in the 90/10 plan. I am highly upset by losing this option. In addition, the restrictions being placed to be allowed to participate in the 80/20 option are ridiculous. I am upset that NC would take part in discriminating against overweight individuals by offering them "less" health care, instead of the best possible. This will only make things worse not better. I am not overweight and would not be affected, but I have friends and relatives who will. I also have a son who is epileptic and I have some medical conditions that require medications. I am not happy about being required to use a mail order prescription plan either. Suppose his medication needs to be adjusted (as happens every few months or so)?? I will have already gotten a 3-month supply and have to change it? I also have to adjust my thyroid medications every few months. I prefer having my medications filled by a pharmacist that I personally know and trust, one who knows my medical history fairly well and makes it a point to check for any contradictions. How can a mail-order service do this for me? In addition, longevity pay is something that we work hard for. I have spent 11 years in NC schools and looked forward to receiving my longevity pay as incentive to stay here. It helps make up for the significant pay cut. However, it will be difficult for career teachers to stay in NC when we have no incentive to do so. I can go back to SC and make far more money with my National Boards. I do understand that there are some budget problems, but I can't believe that cutting out the best parts of working for NC is the only option you have. I urge you to reconsider this bill and be creative with the finances. We are always urged to "think outside the box" as teachers. We often find unique ways to provide our students with what they need even when money is not there. We often take money from our own pockets to make sure we can take care of our students. Why, then, can the state not take care of its employees in the same way? We don't sacrifice the education of our students because the money is not there. We find a way...every single day. So as our representatives, it is up to you to find a way to provide for us. Thank you for your time and consideration of this very important matter.

Subject: Raise for TEACHER

Comment: I among many state employees would like for the Governor to RETHING the raise for Teachers only. The classified persons at the school system should receive the same amount of pay increase as the Teachers. We all contribute to the schools. The cost of living went up for us like the Teachers. We do not make anywhere close to what the Teachers do so this is why it is so important that the classified receieve a raise. With out the classified people in the schools who would answer the phone,clean the floors,fix the food for the students to eat among many other things.? Do you really thing a TEACHER would do the work of a Classified person? When a student gets sick and throes up who do you think cleans it up? A Teach? NO When parents call in for information about classes or other questions do you think a Teacher does this? NO. The whole idea of only the TEACHERS getting a pay increase makes the classified feel so UNIMPORTANT to the Governor. PLEASE PLEASE GIVE THE CLASSIFIED STAFF A RAISE AND HELP TO BOOST THE MORAL OF US ALL. We ALL do a great job. And at times do much more then what our job requires. thank you for taking the time to read this and PLEASE RECONSIDER FOR THE SAKE OF THE CLASSIFIED STAFF IN ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS JANET JONES

Subject: State pay

Comment: Have just been advised by some state employees who put their lives at risk daily and some nights to "help keep NC citizens safe", even working with other federal agents FBI, etc. that they may not receive their earned longevity pay as promised. However, teachers must get their 1+ percentage of increase as it is in their contract. It seems that the earned longevity pay is also in the "contract" an employee signs and is promised when hired in certain positions. These need to be honored. It is important that while creating more jobs for people, that you treat the employees you have with respect and appreciation and honor them with pay increases as promised. As I have said before, our teachers are so important, but so are our SBI agents, and others in similar positions. I would appreciate your support in keeping the longevity pay in place that has already been promised; new employees can be advised of the change. Thanks, Peggy Snead

Subject: Teacher salary/longevity

Comment: I would like to respectfully request consideration for all teachers to sacrifice in an equivalent manner as other state employees during this budget shortfall. Ironically, as a school counselor and I would be on the receiving end of the proposed 1.8% increase. However, I feel strongly that we should all sacrifice equally, regardless of pay grade or department of employment, and not receive this increase. Additionally, I oppose the total suspension of longevity payments for public education employees unless other departments endure equivalent changes. First and foremost, we are all employees of this great state. We are in this together and should sacrifice together in the same manner. Additionally, as an elected member of our local municipal town government, I have a unique perspective regarding budget difficulties, having to personally wrestle with similar issues on a much smaller scale. Treating one group of employees differently from another only increases the liklihood of alienating one or more factions when it is of utmost importance that we are a cohesive group tackling this together.

Comment: I have just been informed that classified employees will not be getting a raise for 2009/10. I understand this if all state employees including teachers do not get raises because of the economice crunch. Classified people do not make anywhere near the salaries of teachers, principals, governors, etc. We are a vital part of the environment of the school setting. We normally do not get as much raise as teachers or other state employee in any given year. If they state of North Carolina would make all people pay their taxes then maybe we would not be in this situation. Classified individuals feel like they are second class citizens.

Subject: Education increases

Comment: Hello, I have just been informed that it is possible that teachers will get an increase in salary next year, but classified staff will not. PLEASE, PLEASE reconsider this. I am actually employed as a Technology Assistant, but I am speaking on behalf of classified employees in general. Unless someone has actually been in a classroom for sometime, they have no idea what really goes on. In order for teachers to be effective, they need a lot of support. This would include anything from preparing materials, to handling discipline. Assistants have already been cut back so much that each of them are now doing the duties of two assistants. Classified employees are already treated like "second-class citizens". To give teachers a raise and not compensate the classified staff at the same rate would be yet another slap in the face for us. Please reconsider. I know that education is extremely important to you. Teachers cannot do it alone. They need the support that Assistants give them, whether in the classroom, media, or technology. Thank you for your time.

Subject: Teacher Assistant pay

Comment: I am disturbed that teacher assistant's may not get a raise in the future and for the years of hard work we will not receive our longevity money. Most days I am in the class room not only helping the teacher but covering classes for teacher's. Most days I work the same hours as teachers. I am considered one of the working poor population now. I can barely make ends meet each month. I love my school and the children. I would hope to be valued instead of considered just a classified employee of the school system. I have been doing my job for l0 years now. I am hoping your views on this matter would have a lot of reconsideration. We are a community trying to raise children and we all work hard and love our children.

Comment: As I understand, teachers will be getting a raise next year, but why not classified employees? Their work is just as critical to the running of my school and their finnacial security as important. Please consider this.

Subject: Teacher Pay Raises

Comment: As a teacher assistant (classified employee), I do not understand the reasoning of giving teachers a pay raise and not classified employees. Teacher assistants carry an incredible workload, comparable to teachers, and are invaluable to the education experience in our schools. With teacher assistants already receiving an insultingly low salary, the lack of an increase continues to send the message that assistants are not valued employees of our school system.

Subject: Classified Staff Raise

Comment: If the budget calls for raises for school employees, please include a raise for the classifed staff. We work hard to support our schools and are a vital member of the team. I understand classified employees recieve a percentage smaller than the certified employees, but please do not consider completely removing a raise for the classied staff. Everyone in the economy is struggling; we ALL need to function as a team and support each other. Financially dividing the teachers, counselors, and principals from the office staff is not a good game plan. Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Subject: Teacher Assistant Pay

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a full time Firefighter and my wife is a Teacher's Assistant. She has been working for the Guilford County School System for 19 years. It has come to our attention that Teachers will possibly be receiving pay raises this year, but certified assistants will not. I know we are in tough times, but I wish you would reconsider this. With almost 20 years of service and dedication my wife only makes about $20,000 a year. She spends alot of her own money buying things for the classroom and her kids. The cost of living has went up from everyone. Including certified assistants. Please consider praising the work they do by at least giving them a small raise to help out in these tough economic times. Thanks for your consideration..... Ken Gray

Comment: As a raise is considered for Teachers. Please consider the Classified (Teacher Assistants) also. We work really hard and the cost of living has gone up on us also. Please have mercy on us and allow us a break in the area of our finances. Thank you in advance, Louise

Subject: Is it true that classified employees of NC will not receive a raise in salary this upcoming school year?

Comment: I am a veteran assistant and have been in constant service for 29 years now. There were years in the beginning of my career that we did not receive any raise compensation for over eight years during the Hunt administration and others. Our pay scales have been frozen locally as well. Why is it that classified positions are considered to be least important in the operation of a school. The positions of my fellow classified employees and myself are very vital in the everyday operation of our school. We have 20 plus children in our classrooms and one teacher. Without us to help that teacher, it would be almost impossible to take care of all the demanding needs the children have day-in-and-day out. The children have a relationship with their assistant as a comfort and security agent in the school when they are away from their home during the day. Therefore, if this is true that classifed positions are not going to get a raise in salary, personally, we are due more that just a small little tidbit. We should be considered right up there with the teachers and administrators because we are the under lying foundation of most NC schools that operate with over 15 students per class. Our job description is anything that no one else wishes to do.

Subject: TEACHER ASSISTANT'S NOT RECEIVING A WELL-DESERVED RAISE

Comment: I THINK THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE IF THE TEACHER'S ASSISTANT'S DON'T GET A RAISE NEXT YEAR. WE WORK HARD AND WE GO BEYOND OUR DUTIES SOMETIMES. PLEASE RETHINK THIS BECAUSE YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE SOME OF THE GOOD ASSISTANTS THAT ARE WILLING TO HANG IN THERE DESPITE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES WE FACE EVERYDAY. WE ARE SUPPOSE TO WORK TOGETHERSO PLEASE DON'T SEPARATE OUR US FROM THE TEACHER'S AND GIVE US OUR DESERVING RAISE THAT WE NEED. TEACHER'S MAKE SO MUCH MORE THAN THE ASSISTANT SO WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU APPRECIATE THEM ANY MORE THAN US. WE HAVE COST OF LIVING INCREASES ALSO AND WE ARE CARING FOR OUR LOVE ONES JUST LIKE THEM. PLEASE BE FAIR AND GIVE US THE SAME INCREASE THAT THEY WILL GET.

Comment: I am writing you requesting you do everything to stop the pay of bonuses to all executives of companies who have received money from our government. The money being used is from taxpayers like myself. This has got to stop. Please stop the payout of bonuses to AIG and the recovery of payout to Bank of America and Merlynch. This is disgraceful and the corporate greed of these individuals is destroying our nation. I am counting on you to step up and do everything in your power to stop the waste of money and to make a stand against corporate greed. We the American people are mad as hell and ready to take our government back form the government that does not work for us.

Subject: Classified staff raise

Comment: Ms. Perdue, I have been with the Guilford County School system since 1972. I drove a School Bus for 18 years to make sure the students would get to and from school safely. I now work inside as a Technology Assistant, I teach the students, I help the teachers, I send in repair tickets, I gather the orders for ink for our school. When the teachers need help I am always there for them. I tutor students that need extra help. I also work in the Computer Lab with out a certified teacher there. I teach the students how to use the computers. All the students have to learn how to type. The fifth grade students need to type 20 words a minute before they finish the fifth grade. As I stated earlier I have worked in the school system since 1972 and I only make $21,000 a year; on this sallary I have to support myself and my disabled husband. So please reconsider the classified staff raise. Sincerely, Wanda Mounce
