Subject: Tax Refund Delays

Comment: As reported on WRAL, "We have a temporary backlog due to the fact that we're having difficulty garnering funds that we're using to manage cash flow," he said. (Kenneth Lay) I expect my tax refund be processed just as usual or I expect to receive interest payments, just as the state expects it when citizens are late. Cut your budgets and face the music like the citizens have to at this time. Sincerely, Matthew Sprague

Subject: Tax Refund

Comment: Hello. I am writing to express my displeasure with the State Department of Revenue for holding tax refunds. I am also writing to request your assistance. I have been waiting for one month for my refund and I read a report tonight that indicated the Department of Revenue is holding refunds...and not because they don't have the money but because they are managing their cash flow. Well, I am trying to manage my cash flow as well. Given the current economic situation, this money is important and the Department of Revenue should not hold our money.

Subject: State Tax Refund

Comment: I would like to know why I have not received my state income tax refund. The news is reporting that the state is holding money because of cash flow issues. This is not the state's money to hold. This is my money that I have allowed the state to hold this year by overpayment of income tax through paycheck withholding. Rest assured that I will no longer trust the state with that money and will change my NC-4 forms to reduce the amount that is being withheld and I am sure that many other taxpayers will do the same. This is not right and I thought that the new administration would keep things like this from happening but apparently I was wrong. Thank you in advance for your quick response.

                        A user with email address of mcsuzi987@msn.com submitted the following question. 



                        I am very upset to hear that the State is holding on to our tax refunds to enable their cash flow. The State holds on to our money throughout the year, therefore increasing their cash flow throughout the year. It is not the state's money to hold on to upon a citizen filing for their refund or claim! As the economy is taking a toll on everyone, it is time to get the money in the proper hands. The government should not be allowed to hold on to our money for their lack of budgetary incompetence!

Our tax refund dollars are not yours! They are ours! This is outragious!

I have been personally waiting on my State Refund for over a month, which was e-filed the first of February!



Sincerely,



Susan McLean

Comment: Governor Purdue I am shocked and angry at what I read on WRAL.com this morning in refernce to the refund status. I understand that the country is in a horrible situation however, I am due my refund in a timely manner, not when the state sees fit. The state takes out my taxes every two weeks without any concern as to what my financial status is. I have zero empathy for NC. We are one of the highest taxed states in the country and it is not the citizens fault that our representatives cannot balance the budget. Please see that you review the status of the tax department and make sure the citizens of NC get their refunds qucikly. In case you didn't know, we are also at one of the highest unemployment rates in the country as well. The citizens need their money as well. Thank you for your time.

Subject: I Support Comprehensive Smoke-free Legislation

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Please support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. As your constituent, I want you to know that I am opposed to individuals smoking inside indoor public places. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Can we really allow workers who must make a living and our children who visit public places with their families to breathe in air that is full of carcinogens? By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. We canâ€™t wait any longer; all those who live and visit North Carolina need to know they are safe in a smoke-free North Carolina. I urge you to support comprehensive legislation which will prohibit smoking in public places in North Carolina. Sincerely, kara milton 5518 Jason Rd Greensboro, NC 27405-9435

Comment: Dear Governor: I am contacting you to let you know my displeasure. I have not yet received my tax refund, despite having filed a month ago. Despite my dutiful overpayment of state income taxes every 2 weeks last year--during which I had to manage my familyâ€™s cash flow--I am now waiting indefinitely for a refund due to the state's inability to refund borrowed money. I realize that these are challenging times for our state. However, I have to-date not received any relief in paying personal, property, sales and other taxes that I am subject to. I hold he state subject to the same bar. Regards, Ken

Comment: I want to know why my tax refund is being held because the state says it can't pay out but so much money at a time yet we have enough money to pay dempsey benton and bill harrison when neither position is needed. Both positions are just more pork barrel money being wasted while the hard working citizens of this state struggle to pay the bills so that you can keep hiring more unneeded workers. I would like someone to contact me about this.

I want to make sure that we will be receiving our return in that I have heard that some states were not doing so because of lack of funds..

Dear Governor Perdue;   

I am writing you with a big concern.  

I just moved up here a year ago from Florida after my mom and my husband died!  My son and granddaughter live here.  After getting a job on the wrong side of town and being threaten, I finally got away and did find another job 6 months ago but after I found my job, because of what the other job did to me I had to move in with my son which is a single parent and put all my belongings for the most part in storage.

 My son then lost his job and we tried to do his own business doing courier, but we just didn't have enough capitol to keep going and with the economy getting back we had to let it go, but  in the mean time he totaled out his car no fault of his and so now we were down to my car, 3 months after I totaled my car out on 440 no fault of mine.  Now both cars are paid off but no money for another.

With the bills and mortgage still having to be paid my son still isn't having any luck finding a job.  We worked hard for out money last year and now the point.

We are one of the lucky one in the fact that we are getting a refund from the state BUT now you are saying we are not getting our refunds!!!!  What are we going to do for food and everything else.? WE need our money please release it.

Sincerely;
Jay Burgher & Dianne Sauer

Comment: This is ridiculous, my Wife and I over paid our taxes and now after filing are unable to receive the refund of that money in a timely manor? If I owed I would be penalized or have to pay an interest on what I owe; but when you owe me I get nothing but please wait. This is great "change" that the Democratic party has brought our country. You Mrs Perdue are quickly bringing us down the same road Michigans wonderful Democrat Governor took them down. Keep going down this road and instead of being one of the few States wih a decent economy we can lose all the good jobs and have average house prices drop to 24,000 too. You need to stop the bad decisions before you absolutely kill our chances to have a better economy.

Comment: I received my Federal Tax Refund over 4 weeks ago and want to know why the state is not releasing funds. I need my money to pay bills and I want to know why you are directing the state to hold the funds in stead of paying them out.

Subject: 2008 Tax Refunds

Comment: I would like to know what the problem is with the NC Dept of Revenue as i have been waiting 3 weeks for our tax refund. Last year we had our refund in a week and one day. With today's technology, this 3 week delay is unacceptable and especially since people need their money in this economy. Please advise as the website should have some kind of suggestion as to when you can expect a refund based upon the date you filed. Something is not right.

Comment: Why is the Department of Revenue avoiding phone calls. You can not get to a "LIVE" person. I paid extra for efiling and should have had my refund 4 weeks ago. NC Tax was taken out of my check every month. Where did it go? What did they do with it? I really need my refund and for them not to answer the phone is poor business. If I owed them and could not pay they would garnish my pay or put a lein on my property. How do I get through to talk to a "LIVE" person. Something needs to be done.

Comment: Nice to see taht things in raleigh don't change with Governors. Where are you hiding ? Why are you not our front telling us taxpayers wwhere OUR money is and why we have not gotten it yet ? Are you going to pay us penalties and interests for the state's illegally not returning MY money to me in a timely manner. DoR has no problem asssessing penalties and interest to taxpayers.. but see we are treated differently when its our money. Thanks for already proving you are nothing but another shady lying politician.

Subject: Payout of State Taxes

Comment: IF I understood correctly, the Governor is trying to delay payment of state tax refunds. This, to me, is ridiculous given we, the people, cannot delay payment of them. Doesn't matter if I can afford it or not, the state takes taxes out of my paycheck on a regular basis and failure for me to pay is illegal& tax evasion, therefore I expect my refund to be paid to me in a timely manner. This state is very expensive given we pay state taxes, sales tax, food tax, gas tax, property tax....actually is there anything that we are not taxed on?? We even voted in the lottery to help our schools, but to date I have seen no benefit to my children's schools. I thought her agenda (per the campaign trail) was to help relieve our financial burdens not to increase them??? Please tell me that I have misunderstood her direction on this

Comment: Governor Perdue- I am frustrated and disappointed with the excuses made by our State Dept of Revenue about their inability, no, unwillingness to pay citizens their tax refunds in a timely manner. I am a single parent and when I pay to E-file my state return it means that I need the money that I have basically loaned the state throughout the year. When the federal government is showing our state up there is a HUGE problem because they rarely do anything right. Please force the NCDOR to do their jobs and give us our money!

Comment: While I fully understand & in many respects feel the effects of the poor economy, I doubt seriously that NC would have accepted "I just don't have it yet" if I had ended up owing taxes this year. Yet, that's what I seem to be hearing while cointinuing to wait for my refund. That isn't right and really shows a lack of respect and consideration to the citizens of NC. While the state needs the money, the people of NC need "THEIR" money too. thank you.

Subject: State Tax Refunds

Comment: I am concerned about the status of my state tax refund. I e-filed my state tax return Feb 6, 2009 and was expecting my refund to be direct deposited around Feb 20, 2009. I understand the state is having financial problems and is not able to process all of the state tax refunds in a timely fashion. This situation really bothers me. I have been having financial difficulties for most of 2008 and into 2009, and yet I was not given the option to delay payment of my state income taxes or vehicle tax to help my situation. I don't believe that the message that the state is sending to the taxpayers and voters is a responsible one. The state had use of my, and every other taxpayers, money for the year 2008, and was able to use those funds to take care of the state's business. Now when we get to 2009, the state doesn't have the funds to pay state tax refunds. I believe this is very poor planning on the part of the state. In my own life, I can not tell my mortgage company, at the end of the month, "Oops, sorry. I don't have the funds right now. I'll get them to you whenever I can." If my life isn't allowed to function this way, then I don't believe that the state should be allowed to function this way either. Further, I believe that the state should be held to a higher standard because they are responsible on a much grander fiscal scale than the taxpayers and voters. I am very disappointed in the state of North Carolina and when you finally come up for reelection, I will not be voting for you and I will be campaigning for the candidate who chooses to run against you in the election. Sincerely, Jay Goodman

Comment: Can you please tell me why I cannot get an explanation on my state refund? It has been over 6 weeks since I filed. I am losing my job because I cannot keep buying gas without money and I am being evicted from my home because I cannot pay rent bercause I cannot afford to go to work. This is simply unacceptable for me and many many others. Can a resident of North Carolina get an answer from her governor or does teh governor not have any answers for us either? What can we do and where can I get help? I am almost 50 years old and have NEVER been in such a predictament and trying to get help around here is unheard of. This is the democratic solution to ignore and maybe we will go away? Please, we the people need help here.

This money is withheld throughout the year from my check, the state earns interest on this money and then when it is time to refund it, won't. This is a serious issue. Please understand the NC residents could stimulate the economy if you would ensure our refunds were sent to us. I would like to hear your response on this issue as would many North Carolinians.

Comment: My husband was layed off from his job a month ago. I work and I make decent money, but, we are not able to manage on my check alone. We have been waiting for our state tax refund for over a month. My family needs that money. Fortunately, my husband was called to work today. I have two seniors who have senior projects that are not cheap. They need 'senior' remembrances.... and we need our money. Can you tell me why the wait is so long. I am aware of the budget problems, but, my money was taken out of my check and given to you (not you personally). So, I need it. My children need it. We need it to pay for gas for my husband to drive his hour away to work.

I can't pay my mortgage or my electric bill. I don't care what your cash flow problem is, mine is alot worse! I will now make sure that in 2009 I withhold enough cash back from my state tax so that I don't have to go through this next year. You can bet you will not have interest free money to hold onto from me in the future. You should be ashamed of yourself! Glad I didn't vote for you!

So is that 30 days for for completion and refund or just completion of the audit? The person I contacted at the NCDOR,for the audit, is a Ms. Nesbitt, could you contact her and found out if we're going to get our refund I'm praying that we don't owe any amount, we were to receive about 2000 dollars and with the way things are we could really use that money. Thank you for your attention in this matter. Any questions please don't hesitate to call.

What about the people who have lost their jobs that are depending on this money. My husband is in the flooring business which is connected to the construction busness which is one of the hardest hit. Going up on taxes going up on insurance going up on light bills and the state allowing this. This is the first year that I have voted and I am glad taht I did because I have a right to voice my opinion.

Subject: Tax Refund

Comment: I would like to know when the tax refunds will be sent out. I understand the state has a financial problem but I don't think withholding tax payers refunds is the answer to your problems. I suggest you fire the personnel that caused this issue and begin to hire people with some background in finance. I plan to never overpay my NC taxes again and plan to spread the word to others to adjust their withholding beginning now.

Subject: holding tax refunds

Comment: On Feb 19 I had a heart attack, costing me so far 50,000, because I have no insurance, no assets, nothing.No way to pay this bill I have been out of work for a month due to this, so no income until I return to work. I was depending on my state refund to pay bills, keep my lights on, keep food in my fridge. Now I can't get my money and I should have had it 2 weeks ago. Now I learn that it is being held to make sure NC has enough money. What I want to know is, will I be paid interest? Am I able to do as the NC dept of revenue would do if I did not pay my taxes on time and garnish the state of NC? This is not fair to the citizens of NC, who work hard,and pay their bills in a timely manner. We are not the ones in government who are overspending, overextending. I need my money or I will be added to the list of people who are living on the streets.

Subject: Tax Refund Held Up Due to Reassignment of Staff

Comment: My tax return was submitted the first week of Feb. and was sent to be audited because I was only a part year resident. I have been in touch with the auditor who has been given other work that takes precedence. Now it will take another 4-6 weeks to process my return This is in no way fair or good.

Subject: STATE INCOME TAX REFUND CHECKS

Comment: This is the 2nd inquiry I have made regarding the issuing of the income tax refund checks. Why is it taking so long to get what is rightfully ours? You wouldnt hold out on unemployment checks, welfare checks etc so why hold money that truly belongs to the taxpayers of this state! Its ludicrous. Simply ludicrous. We are the backbone of this state and country and the money you are holding is ours that we EARNED and was ours to start with. Many of us cant understand why it is now missing! Would someone please take a moment to answer? The employees in the revenue office arent helpful at all. Actually have been downright rude. We care a lot more about what is happening to our money than the fact that the governor signed her first piece of legislation. Isnt that what you are supposed to do for the salary the taxpayers are paying you? I know I sound rude but I and many many more taxpayers are frustrated by this!
