Subject: Wasteful spending by the govenor

Comment: How can the governor stand before the citizens of North Carolina whinning about the state having no money and she is going to cut programs, after she has announced that she will open an office in Charlotte. And also the new high paid positions she has filled. Like we really need a CEO of education (what does the State School Superintendent do?) And opening the office in Charlotte - oh come on now. That is really a waste of money. Just how many hundreds of thousands of dollars will that cost per year, with rent, staff, transportation from Raleigh (which, by the way, is the Capital)drivers probably from the airport, after she takes the state helicopter to Charlotte from Raleigh and back many times a month. Just typical democrats. There really was no substance to the 30-some wasted minutes she was whinning. I would have gotten more out of watching Jeopardy, which was pre-empted.

Subject: Charlotte Office

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to see how you have done so far on your promise to spend a couple of days each month in Charlotte. You also promised to open an office here in Charlotte, but I do not see one listed on your website. Please don't continue to overlook your largest tax base as previous administrations have done. I would like to see you live up to your commitment to focus time, attention and resources on Charlotte. This is a great opportunity for the governor to show support considering the state of the financial markets. Banking isn't only important to Charlotte, it is important to NC. Charlotte is important to NC. Don't overlook us now that you are in office. Thanks, Jeremy Johnson Native North Carolinian and Charlotte Resident
