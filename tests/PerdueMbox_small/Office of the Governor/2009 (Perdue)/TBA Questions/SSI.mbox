Dear Governor
I have hired Rebecca Inglefield of Statesville and Hickory for my disability case.  I had a head injury in 1980 I'm now 47 and have worked off and on when I was able.  The brain injury left my left side mostly paralyzed and with a brace on my left left with about now 50% muscle loose since 1980 that they can not do anything to help, the in July of 2007 I have to have my left lung removed for cancer.  I had to go to the emergency room the other night because I could not breath and my legs and ancles were swollen so bad I could not walk with my leg brace and my cane.  I  first applied in Augest of 2007 for disability at the Statesville office which is covered by your old area office in Greensboro.  Well it has been since Augest 2007 and in Feb. of 2008 I hired a lawyer after being turned down at the first two stages with letters from 3 different speclists saying I was disabled and could not even do light duty work.  My lawyer says I'm still looking at another year so that will be Feb. of 2009.  At the hospital the other night they found my platelets had dropped from 80,0000 to 18,000 and I go back to my hemotoligst and onacoligst on Monday.  He thinks it might be the cancer back.  I have been homeless since Sept. of 2007 and see specialests evey mounth, 1. My family care Dr. 2. My Orthapideck Dr., who gives my shots in my joints. My left albow if now a fused joint and I cant hardly move any other left side joints. 5 My Lung Dr. which has me on a enebulizer 4 times a day, 6. was seeing my onacoligst every 4 months for a CT scan and blood work to see if the cancer was still dormit, but after the news I just got it's not sounding very well.  I was able to get Medicaid after a hearing and the hearing judge got to really see the shape I am in.  I'm slowly dieing.  I need my case expidited and I'm not sure Rebecca Inglefield my lawyer can help me get that doen.  Govner I voted for you now I need your help.  Staying in my car or with friends and family after soon two years is just unheard of.  Please I beg you to step up to base and help me.
Thank you for you time,
Typed by Charles Fortner for Craig Fortner SS Number 244-25-8985 is my son Craigs SS Number.

Subject: Disability Help

Comment: From Gloria Reynolds, DOB 11/18/1956. I have been in the hospital twice since the first of February 2009. I have applied for disability due to major health problems and am awaiting the judge to make a final decision after a hearing in Greensboro, NC on December 12, 2008 (I think it is a Judge Horne who will be, at some point, reviewing the case). Our COBRA insurance is over $1600 per month. We have borrowed from every source possible and could lose our house over the next few months due to the high COBRA premium and failure of the disability court to act upon my disability claim. It is my understanding that there is up to a two year waiting period for disability decisions to be made. For hard working Americans who have worked years and years as I have done, it seems the disability courts could either hire more judeges or more staff so that those who have become disabled do not become homeless. Thank you for any help you can give me regarding this request. Gloria Reynolds

Subject: 33 yr old, family of 6, Denied Diability for Congestive heart failure

Comment: I hope you are well. I would like to inform you about my crisis that I am trying to receive Disability Benefits. In August of 2008, I was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy which is a disorder affecting the heart muscle that usually results in the heart being unable to pump effectively. I was hospitalized for 8 days and during that time I received surgery for a ICD (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), which is a small battery-powered electrical impulse generator which is implanted in patients who are at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation. After surgery my heart only continued to function 10%. I was advised by the cardiologist team not to return to work but apply for Disability Benefits. I applied for Social Security Disability and SSI in September 2008, and have received a decision of denied benefits after waiting 6 months for a decision. While I was in the hospital, physicians told my wife I would have approximately one year to live and my heart is very sick. Can you help me quickly receive the benefits I deserve and have contributed to by working all of my life? I am 33 years old and never thought I would need Disability Benefits at such a young age, but I do. I'm married and have four small children which live with me. I have become desperate because over the course of the last five months, my kids are starting to see the affects of struggling to pay bills and even keep food in the house. I'm desperately asking for help because we can't survive any longer with any income. I served my country in the military; all I'm asking is for my country to serve me, now that I'm disabled. My SS caseworker is Emily Phillips her phone number is 800-662-8721 ext 4043. My pastor has been very helpful to my family and knows of my situation, if you wish to contact him, please do so. His name is Reginald Davis and his number is 336-512-1061. My number is 336-270-6756 if you would like additional information. Please respond and do not let my plea for help go unnoticed. Thank you in advance for your cooperation! Sincerely, Christopher Sellars

Subject: Disability Eligibility

Comment: My son, Robert E. Taylor, Jr. has applied for disability; however, he was denied. When he questioned this, he was told that the first application is ALWAYS denied. My son cannot walk (he requires a wheelchair for mobility), and he is denied disability? This angers me. I see immigrants being given Medicaid, Food stamps, and preferential treatment over natural born citizens. I have witnessed reports made to the Bureau of Citizenship regarding illegal immigrants who are also law violators and nothing is done, yet a man who paid into the system up until he became physically unable to work is denied assistance. What is being done to help citizens of this state when they need help? Why are citizens put on a back burner so immigrants can get assistance? The illegal immigrant problem continues to overtax our social services system, yet it seems nothing is being done about it. When will North Carolinians be represented?

Comment: Fannie Watson, my younger sister, has suffered from mental illness for many years. She has been declined for financial and medical assistance. Her medications are very expensive and the family helps out as much as possible but sometimes Fannie goes without her proper dosage because of lack of money. She has recently applied for disability, again. Please help Fannie get approved for disability this time. Fannie lives in Wilmington, NC. She can be reached at (910)8361214. Thank You, Faith P.

Subject: Disability Determination Services

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, I am writing on behalf of my husband and my daughter Gregory Powell and Madison Powell. My daughter Madison, turned 18 in January 2009, has been physically and mentally disabled since birth, has applied for disabilty. She has been labeled developmentally delayed with characteristics of Williams Syndrome. She has undergone several surgeries in her life which include heart surgery, hip and pelvis reconstruction to having her feet fused. She is on several medications for hypertension and hypothyroidism. She has been in special education all her life. We have to assist her with all daily activities from toileting to getting dressed. She is unable to make a rational decision and can never be left alone. I am perplexed why they have been unable to say she is disabled. Then it leads to my husband, Gregory Powell, at the age of 35 underwent a quadruple bypass. His sternum never healed from this surgery and has undergone 2 surgeries since. The last one he went to Duke for a new procedure to help stabilize his sternum. His has several other comorbidities and is on multiple medicines including heavy narcotics for pain control. He also has to see several other specialist for treatment of the other medical issues. He has been unable to work for the past several years in which he lost one job due to his length of time he had to be out. He has been denied twice for disability and is now waiting for a hearing date. We are at teh point medical bills are piling up and on the verge of losing everything that we have worked for. I am requesting help from you or your office to see if you can help us in any way. Please feel free to contact me @ 704-224-6639. I would appreciate anything you can do and hope to hear a response from you or your office. Thank you again in advance for your time. Sincerely, Kelli Powell Gregory W. Powell 287662835 Madison L.
