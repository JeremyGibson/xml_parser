Governor Perdue,



I know this is your first working day on the job and, while I hate to bother you, I feel that you need to know about a problem I've had today with the Division of Motor Vehicles.  This is the first time I've called them in several years because the last time I called I experienced a similar problem only I didn't have the patience that I had today.



Today I waited in a telephone loop for 120 minutes -- two hours before I finally disconnected!  I never did get a human being any of that time.  I will give them their credit because their voice recording had warned that it was a high volume day and encouraged calling back Wednesday through Friday. 



I'm a recently retired State employee and consider it truly poor customer service to think that an agency is really not prepared to handle the public all five work days, only three.  And, I had assumed incorrectly that the last administration had corrected this problem since I remember reading about it in the newspaper after my last experience.



If you could, I would appreciate it if you add this concern to your already large and growing list of concerns.



Even though I am retired, I offer my assistance to you as our governor.  I am excited that you were elected and eagerly await your refreshing administration!



Sincerely,





Vicky Turner Church

Subject: Potential Savings of $250,000.00 or more



Dear Governor Perdue,

Would you be interested in saving a 1/4 million ($$)dollars or even more.

A recent renovation of the Governors mansion was required because it had acquired massive amounts of black mold.  This was truly detrimental to those living, working, visiting, and doing business there.  Although age was blamed for some of the renovations it was poor housecleaning habits that contributed to most of the black mold.  Using this as an example, these problems are occurring in many of our state buildings.  It is becoming more unhealthy for the people working there and I can only predict that in the near future there may be lawsuits from people who are being exposed to many health hazards. 

What it boils down to is that the janitorial contracts being issued by the state are managed by many different organizations.  They all have different contracts.  They all have different standards.  The quality of their inspections vary widely.  The demands of the contracts are anywhere from 1 page to 40 pages.  How can there be such a diversity of service? 

The Department of Administration has some of the large buildings in Raleigh, they have 6 Inspectors for 8 buildings and there are many complaints about their service.  The DOT Support Services have 5 large buildings in Raleigh and have 92 other DMV and DOH contracts across the State, they only have 2 Inspectors.  The DOH manages many of their own building and coordination is done locally.  Plus, there are many, many, independent state buildings who manage their own contracts and enforcement of the contracts are poor.  Many of our leased building are cleaned by the owners of the buildings and have no established standards of cleaning set by the state.


My proposal is to put all of the cleaning contracts under one organization.  There are plenty of advantages in doing this:


1.  Contract costs can be reduced by regionalizing the contracts and making group bids.


2.  Inspections can be balanced, documented, and done more often.


3.  A higher level of cleaning can be achieved.


4.  Some personnel can be eliminated.


5.  Bidding of multiple contracts can be done competitively, thus reducing overall costs.


6.  Single contract bids can be eliminated.


7.  Poor service can be detected quicker and fixed appropriately.


8.  Bids can be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.



I'm sure that more advantages can be found if this is thoroughly investigated.  Each one of items mentioned above are there because I have seen these problems and I also see solutions.  Please give me the opportunity to present these issues, explain the problems, and propose solutions.  My work history has give me the knowledge and experience to streamline this project.  I was employed with IBM for 28 years as their Sr. Security Consultant, have been a Diebold employee for 5 years as the Manager of a 12 Million dollar budget, and as a Facilities Inspector for 6 years with the DOT it has given me the time, knowledge, and experience to reorganize the cleaning contracts of the State.  Please give me the opportunity to present this information to you.

Hello Governor,

I know that you have a passion for helping our youth.  I have a non-profit program that targets at risk youth and gives them the opportunity to belong, be creative, and enhance their skills.  It is a program called D.R.E.A.M. (Destiny Realized Empowered And Manifested) it is a program that teaches our youth about entrepreneurship, goal setting, time management, and leadership.  I am unsure of what funding is available; however, I know that this program will make a great impact in our children.  It is my desire to offer it at a greater level and see a change come about and our drop out rate decreased. 

I look forward from hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

January 16, 2009

Honorable Governor Perdue:

This is my first time to send a governor an e-mail or any correspondence. 
Thank you for trying to balance our state budget.  I have 2 ideas that you might consider if you deem them appropriate.

1.  We have quite a number of bikers in our state and they use the public roads every day.  If we have to share the roads with these bikers why not have them buy a license plate of some sort the same as an automobile.  My husband and I live on St. Mary's Road in Hillsborough and you would not believe the number of bikers on this road and especially on the weekend.  I think we could bring in a sizable amount of money by having them buy a biker's license plate.

2.  Trash along side the roadways.  I have noticed that on Mondays there is a lot of trash on the roadsides that have blown off trucks taking their weekly trash to a local trash dump drop off.  If these trucks are required by law to put a tarp over the back of their trucks when hauling this trash it would cut down on roadside trash.  Also if they are fined when caught without the tarp over the trash it would also bring in revenue.  Just place a highway patrolman at the sights over the weekends and I think you will be surprised at how many will be caught.

    Also on the highways a lot of trash is being blow off construction trucks ie  5-gallon buckets; large pieces of plastic, etc.  I think the same should also apply to them.

I think these two items would bring in more revenue for the state.

I know you are very busy at this time, but I would appreciate your letting me know if you think these are workable.

Thank you for your time,

Pat Weaver

Dear Governor Perdue,

Although I am not a citizen of your wonderful state I did serve there while in the military service years ago. The reason I am asking for your help is because nobody else wants to assist me with anything except taking my money. Over twenty years ago, closer to twenty-one, I received two traffic violations, that I did pay for, but no record can be found. I am not denying these tickets, just that they were paid for years ago. Now after all these years and numerous license renewals I'm told that my money was never received. The courts and the District Attorneys say that I must hire an attorney which being a laid-off auto worker is impossible for me financially. Surely these two tickets, paid for once already, could not cause as much financial hardship for these two counties as it would for my family. I'm not a criminal nor someone trying to not pay for his mistakes. I know that you must be very busy, but if there is anything you could be I would be very appreciative. The counties is question are McDowell (ref #88IF2571)and Duplin (ref #89IF112), both fines were mailed in prior to my deployments. I thank you for your time.



Respectfully,

Subject: State Ethics Commission - Mandatory SEI Filing Requirements for HWTF Commissioners
Importance: High



Attached for your information is the Board of Ethics' January 2009 one page mini-newsletter regarding the annual Statement of Economic Interest (SEI) filing deadline – April 15, 2009.   As Commission members appointed by the Governor, Senate Pro-Tem or Speaker of the House, you are obligated to file an annual SEI with the NC Board of Ethics.  By now, you should have received a notice in the mail from the State Ethics Commission about this annual filing requirement.



If you did not file in 2008 or have never filed because you are newly appointed to the Commission, then you’ll need to fill out the <http://www.doa.state.nc.us/ethics/form1.htm>Statement of Economic Interest (long form).  In 2009, individuals who previously filed an SEI in 2008 and remain in the same position will have the following options to comply with the annual SEI filing requirements:



1. File a 2009 “No-Change Form.” The 2009 No-Change Form is designed for filers who have had no changes to their personal or financial circumstances that would require an update to their 2008 SEI. That Form includes an optional Additional Disclosure Addendum on which filers may, but need not, disclose additional information to assist the SEC in advising the filer.  The form can be downloaded at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.


1. File a 2009 “Amendment to SEI.” The Amendment to SEI is designed for filers who have had some changes to their personal or financial circumstances that require an update to the information provided on their most recently filed 2008 SEI, but who do not want to file a new “Long Form.” These filers need only respond to questions where they have had changes to their filing information. However, in the event you have any changes to your 2008 responses to a particular question, you must answer that question fully and completely, updating that information on the 2009 Amendment to SEI as of the time period identified in that question. For example, if during 2008 you sold securities that were previously disclosed or you bought securities in another company valued at $10,000 or more, you must respond to Question 5(a) on the 2009 Amendment to SEI in full by listing all securities owned as of 12/31/08. It is not sufficient to only list the names of securities purchased and sold. The Amendment to SEI also includes an optional disclosure addendum. Please see the instructions to the Amendment to SEI for additional information.  (FYI – The Amendment to SEI is only available to individuals who filed a complete SEI in 2008, please contact the State Ethics Commission at (919) 807-4620 or <mailto:ethics.commission@doa.nc.gov>ethics.commission@doa.nc.gov)


1. File a New 2009 SEI “Long Form.” Filers always have the option of filing a new SEI (the “Long Form”), responding to all 19 questions. A newly-filed Long Form will supersede and replace any previously-filed forms. This form can be downloaded at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.


All forms are available electronically on the SEC’s website at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.



You must mail or deliver your original, notarized form to the SEC no later than April 15, 2009 - Failure to comply may subject you to a $250 fine and disciplinary action, including removal from your public position.  Electronic or faxed SEIs will not be accepted. Please retain a copy for your records.



For any specific questions about forms or filing, please contact the State Ethics Commission at 919-807-4620.  For general questions, please feel free to call Kristal Kingi-Shearin, HWTF Administrative Officer at 919-855-6876.



If you have already filed this SEI form for 2009, please disregard this reminder.  And please let me know once you have filed your form, so I can remove you from this reminder list.  Thanks!

the reservation system is appreciated but it has many flaws, reservations should not be allowed for less than one week. a person could make a series of one day reservations spread out over several weeks effectively tying up a site so that it could be reserved for a one week period thereby eliminating the $3 surcharge on most nights.
we travel and use state parks in other states, you are the only ones that have a $3 surcharge per night's stay to support the reservations system. we book thru Reserve America and the rate is the walk up rate
i could understand a charge for the reservation but 1 day or 14 days is still one reservation, it doesn't cost 13 times more.
will the senior rate also be taken away?
this just sounds like a money grab rather providing a service for the residents of the state.

"Dedicated to an Enriched Mosaic of the People, Culture, History, Heritage,

Geography, Faith, Politics, and Education within the beautiful state of North Carolina"



January 21, 2009



Governor Bev Perdue

20301 Mail Service Center

Raleigh, North Carolina 27699-0301



Dear Governor Perdue:



Congratulations on your historic inauguration as the chief executive of the state of North Carolina.  Also, thank you for the openness and the inclusiveness that has been exhibited to the citizens of our state during the early stages of your administration.



Right at the beginning of this letter, I want to establish that I have no desire to personally sit on the North Carolina Historical Commission. 



However, I am writing to suggest that your appointments to this important commission should allow for a much more inclusive reflection of the racial/ethnic mosaic of North Carolina.



from my consultation with staffers at Archives and History, it appears that prior to 1975, no ethnic minorities were appointed to the Historical Commission.   Since 1975, there has never been more than one ethnic minority at a time to serve on this eleven-member commission, which has major responsibilities for the content and the depiction of history in North Carolina.  It appears that each of the solitary minority members of the commission have come from one single minority group and from one single section of the state.



I know that the mere suggestion of a greater inclusion and variety of minorities on the Historical Commission opens the door for critics who might say that this is a request for a quota system.   In anticipation of this criticism, I ask that you think broadly and that you use your appointive authority to include multiple whites and multiple minorities.  I hope you agree that the important gate-keeping duties of the state's Historical Commission should be viewed through the collaborative and composite lenses of blue, green, ... and brown eyes. 



Thank you again for your consideration of this suggestion.



Sincerely,



Eddie Davis

Chair, Inclusive North Carolina

Subject: State Ethics Commission - Mandatory SEI Filing Requirements for HWTF Commissioners
Importance: High



Attached for your information is the Board of Ethics' January 2009 one page mini-newsletter regarding the annual Statement of Economic Interest (SEI) filing deadline – April 15, 2009.   As Commission members appointed by the Governor, Senate Pro-Tem or Speaker of the House, you are obligated to file an annual SEI with the NC Board of Ethics.  By now, you should have received a notice in the mail from the State Ethics Commission about this annual filing requirement.



If you did not file in 2008 or have never filed because you are newly appointed to the Commission, then you’ll need to fill out the <http://www.doa.state.nc.us/ethics/form1.htm>Statement of Economic Interest (long form).  In 2009, individuals who previously filed an SEI in 2008 and remain in the same position will have the following options to comply with the annual SEI filing requirements:



1. File a 2009 “No-Change Form.” The 2009 No-Change Form is designed for filers who have had no changes to their personal or financial circumstances that would require an update to their 2008 SEI. That Form includes an optional Additional Disclosure Addendum on which filers may, but need not, disclose additional information to assist the SEC in advising the filer.  The form can be downloaded at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.


1. File a 2009 “Amendment to SEI.” The Amendment to SEI is designed for filers who have had some changes to their personal or financial circumstances that require an update to the information provided on their most recently filed 2008 SEI, but who do not want to file a new “Long Form.” These filers need only respond to questions where they have had changes to their filing information. However, in the event you have any changes to your 2008 responses to a particular question, you must answer that question fully and completely, updating that information on the 2009 Amendment to SEI as of the time period identified in that question. For example, if during 2008 you sold securities that were previously disclosed or you bought securities in another company valued at $10,000 or more, you must respond to Question 5(a) on the 2009 Amendment to SEI in full by listing all securities owned as of 12/31/08. It is not sufficient to only list the names of securities purchased and sold. The Amendment to SEI also includes an optional disclosure addendum. Please see the instructions to the Amendment to SEI for additional information.  (FYI – The Amendment to SEI is only available to individuals who filed a complete SEI in 2008, please contact the State Ethics Commission at (919) 807-4620 or <mailto:ethics.commission@doa.nc.gov>ethics.commission@doa.nc.gov)


1. File a New 2009 SEI “Long Form.” Filers always have the option of filing a new SEI (the “Long Form”), responding to all 19 questions. A newly-filed Long Form will supersede and replace any previously-filed forms. This form can be downloaded at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.


All forms are available electronically on the SEC’s website at <http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm>http://www.ethicscommission.nc.gov/secoi.htm.



You must mail or deliver your original, notarized form to the SEC no later than April 15, 2009 - Failure to comply may subject you to a $250 fine and disciplinary action, including removal from your public position.  Electronic or faxed SEIs will not be accepted. Please retain a copy for your records.



For any specific questions about forms or filing, please contact the State Ethics Commission at 919-807-4620.  For general questions, please feel free to call Kristal Kingi-Shearin, HWTF Administrative Officer at 919-855-6876.



If you have already filed this SEI form for 2009, please disregard this reminder.  And please let me know once you have filed your form, so I can remove you from this reminder list.  Thanks!

Subject: Response from DHHS/DMA to a "Governor's Inquiry"



Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,



I am writing on behalf of Margaret Hiatt and her three sons.  I have been trying to intervene on their behalf to secure Medicaid Waiver, CAP-MR/DD, services.  I believe they are not unique and other families are having the same problem.  I have tried to suggest that a simple exception can be made for all of the families who have more than one adult residing in the home and receiving CAP-MR/DD services.  If DHHS/DMA/DMHDDSAS truly believe that the Comprehensive Waiver that became effective 11/1/08 does not allow for any exceptions, then why are they not considering a simple Technical Amendment? 



Here is the relevant language from the waiver document (top of Page 9 of 189):



The #0662 Comprehensive Waiver will offer adult participants the opportunity to choose their parents, guardian of the person or other family member to provide a daily service through a Home Supports service definition. Home Supports will be similar to Residential Supports which is provided in the group homes. Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.

> NOTE BY MARY SHORT (1/13/09):  In the above paragraph, please be aware that Residential Supports is provided in GROUP HOMES.  Meaning, that the provider is paid for MORE THAN ONE individual to provide a 24-hour service to each individual.  Because Medicaid is billed for "1 unit" of service (24 hours equals 1 unit), a provider who has 4 residents can bill 4 units a day without violating Medicaid billing rules.  And that is necessary because a provider may take a resident to a medical doctor who is also going to bill Medicaid for "units" of services within that same 24-hour period.


A Technical Amendment (TA ... and there were four TA's to the previous waiver) would be quite simple: 



Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.  However, parent(s) who reside with more than one adult child may provide Home Supports in the same manner as Residential Supports are provided in group homes OR alternative services of Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services may be provided in conjunction with others not living with the participants.



All my suggested TA does is return these families to hourly services to be provided by either the parent(s) or other staff, related or unrelated, living with or not living with.  And as hourly services, any one person would not bill for more than 16 hours a day!  And as hourly services, any one person could work in any combination needed amongst all the CAP-MR/DD recipients in the home!



I am not shocked by the attached response (see Word file attached).  This is consistent with my attempts at suggesting the above alternatives.  DMA/DMHDDSAS completely refuse to acknowledge there is anything they can do to fix the problem.  And please, please understand that "a plan of care and appropriate services have been developed to meet the needs of all three of your sons" is only PART of the truth!  Ms. Hiatt has been told she had NO ALTERNATIVE.  I have no idea what other families have been told.  I truly don't believe there are more than 35 families who would need this exception or TA.



Please, Gov. Perdue or Sec. Cansler contact me as soon as possible so that we can work toward getting these families the simple services they ALL had under the previous waiver!  I have Ms. Hiatt's permission to release information.

Dear Governor Predue,

Donna and I were very proud for you as you were inaugurated this last week.
Although we are registered Republicans, we have supported and voted for you since our days as restaurant owners in Carteret County.
While operating Loughry's Landing Restaurant in Beaufort, we had the opportunity to visit with you at Hunter Chadwick's and support your campaign.

As I told you then I would like to help in any way possible.

Now that I have sold my restaurant and retired, I would like to make that statement again, if I can help I will.

I love Brickwalls and Bureaucrats, they provide me with incentive to make things happen. There are no B & B that can't be redirected to accomplish the goals set forth by the Governor.

My background is varied and interests are wide.

As to background I have had senior positions in Industrial Relations for Companies such as PPG, Goodyear Tire, IBP and Western Gear Corp. My Restaurants have included The Museum Of Art Cafe Raleigh, Herons Restaurant Cary, Ottis' Restaurant - Morehead City, Loughry's Landing - Beaufort and Loughry's Landing - Atlantic Beach.
During that time I worked with both local and state officials in the Tourism industry and was a member of the NC Restaurant Association board of directors. I was also chairman of the Carteret County Hospitality Association.
I have extensive Employment Security experience as the Chair of the Morehead City Employers Committee, the Chair of the Tennessee State Committee, Chair of the North Dakota State Committee and Chair of the Region 5(Denver and north) Committee.

My current interests, since I have retired is do everything that I didn't do in the past. We travel extensively by truck and 5th wheel camper. NC is not up to par with many states as we relate to state parks. If I could make a difference in the that system I would like to help. Our facilities are good but we are behind time in the administration of them.
I have hired laborers to PhD's. and don't believe that to offer a child extra credit for CC courses is a motivator to keep them in school since they don't want to be there in the first place. We need to offer a skills program that teaches students a trade and allows them to work and go to school. As the administrator of a large apprentice program for PPG, I know there are many non-traditional ways to teach math and grammar skills without the student knowing that he was learning those skills. Watching students drop out in Carteret County while thinking if they could only learn to be builders or the basics of culinary skills while going to high school, how much better they would be.


I WANT TO HELP - JUST TELL ME HOW

Thanks

Joe Loughry

thanks you for the quick response

if you follow this link  <http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/map_of_campgrounds/r/browseMaps.do?topTabIndex=CampgroundMap>http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/map_of_campgrounds/r/browseMaps.do?topTabIndex=CampgroundMap
you will note that many states have state campgrounds listed, the lowest bidder is not always the best.

you failed to address two points 1. will the senior rate go away in using the reservations and 2. the one day stay for reservations (if i make a saturday, wednesday, friday and saturday reservation, i lock up a site for a week. i think a period less than 7 days is unreasonable because of this. you could also make a saturday reservation and block a two week rent by taking the choice day out. you need to control this.

that said i am happy for the reservation system but the state is going blindly as it so often does

thanks

Dear Governor Perdue,

Although I am not a citizen of your wonderful state I did serve there while in the military service years ago. The reason I am asking for your help is because nobody else wants to assist me with anything except taking my money. Over twenty years ago, closer to twenty-one, I received two traffic violations, that I did pay for, but no record can be found. I am not denying these tickets, just that they were paid for years ago. Now after all these years and numerous license renewals I'm told that my money was never received. The courts and the District Attorneys say that I must hire an attorney which being a laid-off auto worker is impossible for me financially. Surely these two tickets, paid for once already, could not cause as much financial hardship for these two counties as it would for my family. I'm not a criminal nor someone trying to not pay for his mistakes. I know that you must be very busy, but if there is anything you could be I would be very appreciative. The counties is question are McDowell (ref #88IF2571)and Duplin (ref #89IF112), both fines were mailed in prior to my deployments. I thank you for your time.



Respectfully,

Timothy E. Head

Report downplays threat to kids online

Brad Stone, The New York Times <http://www.newsobserver.com/news/crime_safety/v-print/story/1366312.html#MI_Comments_Link>Comment on this story

The Internet may not be such a dangerous place for children after all.

A task force created by 49 state attorneys general -- and aggressively pushed by N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper -- to look into sexual solicitation of children online has concluded that there is not a significant problem.

The findings ran counter to popular perceptions of online dangers as reinforced by depictions in the news media like NBC's "To Catch a Predator" series.

Cooper was quick to criticize the group's report.

In a statement Tuesday, Cooper said the report "relied on outdated and inadequate research to downplay the problem of child predators.

"Law enforcement officers across the country are telling attorneys general that children are being solicited every day and that technology companies must do more to keep children safer," Cooper said.

The Internet Safety Technical Task Force examined the extent of the threats children face on social networks like MySpace and Facebook, amid widespread fears that adults were using these popular Web sites to deceive and prey on children.

Look out for bullies

But the report cited research calling such fears a "moral panic," and concluded that the problem of bullying among children, both online and offline, poses a far more serious challenge than the sexual solicitation of minors by adults.

"This shows that social networks are not these horribly bad neighborhoods on the Internet," said John Cardillo, a member of the task force and chief executive of Sentinel Tech Holding, which maintains a sex offender database. "Social networks are very much like real-world communities that are comprised mostly of good people who are there for the right reasons."

The report is to be released today. The 39-page document was the result of a year of meetings between dozens of academics, childhood safety experts and executives of 30 companies, including Yahoo, AOL, MySpace and Facebook.

The task force, led by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, looked at scientific data on online sexual predators and found that children and teenagers are unlikely to be propositioned by adults online. In the cases that do occur, the report says, teenagers are typically willing participants and are already at risk because of poor home environments, substance abuse or other problems.

In what social networks may view as something of an exoneration after years of pressure from law enforcement, the report says that sites like MySpace and Facebook "do not appear to have increased the overall risk of solicitation."

Cooper has been sounding the alarm for more than three years about child predators using the social networking sites to find victims. In June 2006, Cooper sat on a panel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. His appearance came a day after MySpace announced new safety features that would restrict adults' ability to look at the personal information of young users.

The following year, he unsuccessfully sought state legislation to require the companies to get parental consent before allowing children younger than 16 to join and post personal information. But in early 2008, MySpace and Facebook both struck agreements with Cooper and other attorneys general to adopt procedures to help keep predators away from children.

Cooper was not the only attorney general unhappy with the conclusions. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said the report "downplayed the predator threat," and failed to provide a specific plan for improving the safety of social networking.

"Children are solicited every day online," Blumenthal said. "Some fall prey, and the results are tragic. That harsh reality defies the statistical academic research underlying the report."

The attorneys general also asked the task force to evaluate technologies that can enhance safety for children online.

Among the systems the technology board looked at included age verification technologies that try to authenticate the identities and ages of children and prevent adults from contacting them. But the board concluded that such systems "do not appear to offer substantial help in protecting minors from sexual solicitation."

Nevertheless, Cooper praised the task force for identifying existing technologies that can help keep kids safer on the Internet. He said that the attorneys general will push social networking sites to implement them.
