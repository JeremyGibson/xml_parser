I am Frances Platt son and requested that the below matters be reviewed and forwarded to the correct department; to resolve our compliant.
Officer Cater arrive at the scene of auto accident 02/07/2009†involving Frances Platt; who†was hit by a†vehicle and seriously injured† while crossing the road†as a†pedestrian.†The car accident happen†around†2:00am in the morning. One of Frances Platt associates†tried to give officer Cater information about the accident and Frances medical history. Officer Cater stated to the independent witness to go into the house or†she would arrest her. At the scene of accident there†is an†visible pedestrian cross walk sign and 30†mph speed sign.†Officer Cater did not issue an†reckless driving citation to the driver of the†vehicle†nor†give the driver†an alcohol test.†One of the passengers names in the vehicle seem to be an alias. The driver of the vehicle did not report the accident to the Enterprise Rental Car company or†insurance company. Frances Platt relatives reported the accident to Enterprise Rental Car company 10 days after accident†and they retrieve the vehicle involved in the accident. The person on the rental car contract was not the driver and did not have insurance or pay for Enterprise Rental Car insurance.†
The officer Cater†police report was very†short; according to <mailto:%20dgallant@cmpd.org>Captain†Doug Gallant†District Attorney Liaison Unit opinion and†comments†" An oofficer should investigate the scene of the accident and take into account as much detail as possible and questions witnesses. Also around 2:00am in the morning†it would be normal;†for alcohol†test to be given to driver; involved in pedestrian accident. Especially if there was an pedestrian†cross walk and sign at scene."††Captain Doug Gallant spent many years handling pedestrian traffic accidents before moving to his current position. I spoke with Office Cater commanding officer, Captain Bruce Ballamy twice about the matter after contacting the Chief of Police office to seek help. Captain Bruce Ballamy stated that its up to Cater discretion to issue an citation; even if the driver violated any North Carolina traffic laws. Base on†speaking with DMV department and explaining the accident circumstances according to police report; DMV†stated an citation should be issued to the driver for not giving, Frances Platt the right†away at an pedestrian cross walk.†After reviewing†officer Cater recent and current citation history; its usual that the police report is so short and missing more detail about the accident scene circumstances†and other independent†witnesses statements.†Also the driver and other passenger in the vehicle seem to have family relationships with other Law enforcement officers and government departments or officer Cater; which might explain, officer†Cater lack of details in the report or†failure to perform an thorough investigation at the accident seen. I†call†the†commanding Officer,†Chief of Police, Mayor Office, District Attorney Office,†State Attorney General†Office, Internal Affairs Office; complaining and asking for help about the above matters.
My mother†is still in the North Carolina Medical Center†hopsital and†injured very badly; the driver of the†vehicle should be held accoutable for not, yielding the right away to Frances Platt. ††
Base upon the above concerns, I ask that an†investigation be done to review officer Cater conduct and actions†on 02/07/2009; at the accident scene.†
Best Regards,
D. Platt †

Subject: Fayetteville Police Department Harassment continues

Comment: 25 February 2009 Fayetteville Police Department (F.P.D.) Office of Professional Standards (O.P.S.) 467 Hay Street Fayetteville, NC 28301 Subject: F.P.D. HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EVENTS CONTINUES Dear O.P.S.: The purpose of this letter is to address the continuing harassment by many, not all, F.P.D. officers any time that I call them as the most recent incident will describe below: On February 23, 2009, at approximately 4:00 p.m. E.S.T, I was hit by a black vehicle by an African-American male in a military uniform who went through a stop sign on McPherson Church Road adjacent to Jiffy Lube and near Olive Garden where I was walking to (due to epilepsy and no drivers license) to seek employment. I was hit in the right side of my body and the injuries were slight, therefore, I wished to document the incident for other legal reasons even though there were no tags on the back of the vehicle that hit me. I called 911 and the female officer in vehicle number 1213, NC Auto Tag WF-195548-R, responded, initially ignored me and was walking inside Jiffy Lube instead of towards me, was aloof, insolent and stated that she was ‚Äúnot going to make a report due to it not making sense that you are in the Cambridge Arms area‚Äù. 1. Why would it matter where any ‚Äúhit and run‚Äù occurs? 2. There are many businesses in the Cambridge Arms area, so it does make ‚Äúsense‚Äù that an unemployed person would be in the area seeking employment. 3. The female officer was communicating with an older, white male in a white vehicle, auto tag: XWA1554 and is there any connection? Subsequently, I called 911 again, requested to speak to the Watch Commander and was connected to Officer Reed who told me to wait for him at the location and I did while the female officer remained in her patrol car, speaking on a cell phone. Officer Reed was even more disrespectful and condescending asking irrelevant questions and dismissing my comments. Here are the problems with Officer Reed: 1. Officer Reed asked who my attorney is and this is his only question that I refused to answer, thus, he stated: ‚ÄúI am not going to take the report because you are uncooperative.‚Äù 2. Officer Reed was communication with the Jiffy Lube employees with much more respect than with me and asked them if they wanted me on their property when I was on the sidewalk the majority of the time as instructed by 911 operators. Why would Officer Reed attempt a trespass incident when I was told by F.P.D. to wait there? 3. I was cooperative with Officer Reed on every question and informed him of the Constitutional 5th Amendment of the U.S.A. Bill of Rights after, I repeat, after he stated that he was not going to take the report due to not being informed of my attorney‚Äôs name and he was entering his patrol car. 4. I called 911 again and spoke with an officer (I do not remember his name) and Officer Reed came back out to give me my NC State ID back and a report number: 2009-6474. As he left, Officer Reed asked me who I spoke with at F.P.D., I told him that I did not remember the name of the officer, he walked away and mumbled about no report was going to be done. Even though these multiple incidents occurring to the same person that even I find bizarre as well as my police officer friends in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida found to be unusual until they themselves witnessed some of them, here are my 3 basic questions: 1. Why do most times that I call 911, F.P.D. initially treats me, the victim, unprofessionally with no objectivity as I have pending Civil Litigation cases and some information that I have is attorney-client privilege and they should just do their duty by making an unbiased report, no matter how unusual the frequency for reasons to be explained in court at a later date. 2. Is the F.P.D. aware of whom I am due to other police corruption cases and could this explain part of the harassment? Any and all calls to F.P.D. may be subpoenaed (pro and con), affidavits if any signed may be subpoenaed, and cross examination by my attorneys in court for connections, if any. 3. Will this pattern of F.P.D. harassment continue, including the surveillance? For your information, my attorney in Anchorage, Alaska for 2 previous incidents and for any future contact is Adam Bartlett and his number is: 907.277.0535. Sincerely, Gerry Lindgren C/O Andersons 7896 King Road Fayetteville, NC 28306 4 February 2009 Fayetteville Police Department (F.P.D.) Office of Professional Standards (O.P.S.) 467 Hay Street Fayetteville, NC 28301 Subject: F.P.D. HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EVENTS Dear O.P.S.: My name is Gerry Lindgren, (574.52.0295; State of NC ID #39146496), and I am writing to report the recent harassment and discrimination events that I have received this past week from some of the F.P.D. officers and will forward a copy of this letter to my attorney, Governor Perdue, the A.C.L.U. and the U.S. Senate and Congress due to pending civil action against the Los Angeles Police Department, West Hollywood Sheriff Department, Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, the Anchorage Police Department, Dunn, NC Police Department, and associated entities and individuals, public and private and am concerned with retaliation and targeted entrapment from the F.P.D. due to events that I am not at liberty to currently state. The most atrocious occurring on February 4, 2009 at Cross Creek Mall with Officer Hererra who was insolent, unprofessional, intimidating, and threatening with the African-American security guard of Cross Creek Creek Mall and there were many eyewitnesses. First, let‚Äôs chronologically, briefly address this past week, notwithstanding the incident in 2007. 1. On February 3, @ 8:20 p.m. E.S.T., I called 9/11 due to a large African American male threatening me with violence and F.P.D. Officers Black and Armstrong responded. Officer Black was very churlish and discourteous by treating me, the victim, like the aggressor by asking me why I was walking the streets of Fayetteville all day rather than taking the report and apprehending the aggressor who was standing a few yards away. I responded to him that I am unemployed, looking for work, had my resumes, have epilepsy and do not drive and was quite bewildered on why that would be an issue. I described the aggressor as a large black male with a fluffy black jacket. Officer Black was ill-mannered and kept repeating that I need a better description although I kept pointing to the man who was less than 20 yards away. Thus, I called 9/11 again and spoke with the Watch Commander and the 2 responding officers departed without stating anything. 2. On February 3 @ 12:29 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by F.P.D. Officer Chavez on Mcpherson Church Road/Collinwood (after the officer spoke with a male in a black S.U.V.) while seeking employment. 3. On February 4, 2009 @ 2:14 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by Officer Combs on Mcpherson Church Road (near the Olive Garden) while seeking employment. 4. On February 4 @ 3:30 p.m., E.S.T., I walked from the Olive Garden on Sycamore Dairy Road to Cross Creek Mall. I was only in for a few minutes and upon exiting, a women intentional knocked into me and I was verbally and physically harassed by the on-lookers referring to me with obscenities. I walked past them to the other entrance to make a report to security. As I entered, I walked by Officer Hererra who initially walked past me saying nothing. I stated that he ‚Äúmust stop having the public harass me‚Äù and he turned around and stopped and searched me. Then, the African-American Security Chief at Cross Creek Mall who has always given me a bad time joined in harassing me and claimed that people claimed that I yelled an obscenity (UNTRUE AND THEY PROVIDED NO EYEWITNESSES TO COLLOBORATE THEIR CLAIM AND NO WRITTEN DOCUMENT AND/OR AFFADAVIT). Then, Officer Hererra asked me to grab my property and go to the security room. As I was doing this, he screamed at me and threatened me, handling his gun. NOTE: I TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE EPILPSY. I ALSO HAVE AIDS AND ARC (AIDS RELATED COMPLICATIONS) THAT INCLUDE DISABLING PERIPHERAL-NEUROPATHY THAT AFFECTS THE HANDS AND FEET EXTREMITIES, AND IN SEVERE CASES LIKE MINE, IT AFFECTS THE ARMS, LEGS AND WALKING IN ADDITION TO SEVERE ARTHRITIS SINCE CHILDHOOD AND DIFFICULTY WITH UNCONTROLLED BOWELL MOVEMENTS DUE TO THESE ILLNESSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ARE DOCUMENTED, MOST RECENTLY ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY 2009 WITH DR. CHIMA AT SOUTHER REGIONAL A.H.E.C., AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS EXCEPT FOR EPILEPSY. 5. On the way to the inside the Cross Creek Mall Security, there were many eyewitnesses, mostly military personnel, who witnessed the harassment of Officer Hererra threatening me to walk faster and ready to assault me. Inside the Security Room, the African-American Security Chief slammed the door on my right shoulder while Officer Hererra was standing right behind me so close that I could feel his breathing on my neck. The African-American security guard banned me for one year after I refused to sign his deceitful and duplicitous document that left the omissions of how everything started with no due process to challenge any of the lies and specifically mentioned that if I went to the Bank of America, that I would be arrested. Subsequently, I called 9/11 again to speak with on of the 2 Watch Commanders, so I was transferred to the Cross Creek one who came on duty @ 3:00 p.m., E.S.T., Lieutenant Kelly who incredulously stated to me to ‚Äúgo see a doctor ‚Äú and hung up the phone on me. I called again and he repeated the same infantile comments. Later, at 5:00 p.m., E.S.T., I called for an apology and he denied speaking to me or even knowing about the Cross Creek Mall incident even though he was the on-duty (although he is unfit for duty) Watch Commander for this specific location. Then, the African-American security chief, numerous other security guards with hands on and near their weapons, along with Officer Hererra, walked me all the way to Skibo Road, even following in vehicles that seemed quite excessive with numerous outside eyewitnesses as I did not disobey, I repeat, I did not disobey any order other than telling them that attempting to force me to sign a document, especially one filled with falsehoods, is illegal and this angered them. 6. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peripheral-neuropathy ‚Ä¢ Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove. ‚Ä¢ Peripheral neuropathy can result from such problems as traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of the disorder is diabetes. ‚Ä¢ In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time ‚Äî especially if it's caused by an underlying condition that can be resolved. Medications initially designed to treat other conditions, such as epilepsy and depression, are often used to reduce the painful symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms Your nervous system is divided into two broad categories. Your central nervous system consists of your brain and spinal cord. All the other nerves in your body are part of your peripheral nervous system, which includes: ÔÇß Sensory nerves to receive feelings such as heat, pain or touch ÔÇß Motor nerves that control how your muscles move ÔÇß Autonomic nerves that control such automatic functions as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder function Most commonly, peripheral neuropathy begins in the longest nerves ‚Äî the ones that reach to your toes. Specific symptoms vary, depending on which types of nerves are affected. Signs and symptoms may include: ÔÇß Gradual onset of numbness and tingling in your feet or hands, which may spread upwards into your legs and arms ÔÇß Burning pain ÔÇß Sharp, jabbing or electric-like pain ÔÇß Extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch ÔÇß Lack of coordination ÔÇß Muscle weakness or paralysis if motor nerves are affected ÔÇß Bowel or bladder problems if autonomic nerves are affected ÔÇß Causes ÔÇß A number of factors can cause neuropathies. These factors include: ÔÇß Autoimmune diseases. These include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. ÔÇß Other diseases. Kidney disease, liver disease and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) also can cause peripheral neuropathy. Patients with HIV/AIDS also are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy. ÔÇß Inherited disorders. Examples include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyloid polyneuropathy. I respectfully request an inquiry into this incident and why anyone who may or may not have complained about me was not mentioned or corrective action to them due to harassing me by calling me ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and pushing me that initiated the whole incident in addition to the rescinding of the 1-year ban as I will forward this letter to the following businesses at Cross Creek Mall. Sincerely, Gerry Lindgren c/o Andersons‚Äô 7896 King Road Fayetteville, NC 28306 910.423.7855

Subject: court system

Comment: I am having problems with the courts in Onslow County. They say NC is cracking down on drug. Police can make all the arest they want but the fact is they are slipping in the courts. I know an convected fellon which I have problems with for several years and he is caught selling & delivering drugs and all he gets is probation. Then he is caught again and it is all over the news and papers and when he goes to court all he agian gets is probation. I do not understand! There is something wrong with the Judges, District Attorneys, and probation officers. Do you know that I have tried to call his probation officer to find out when they are going to do a probation violation for the first charge and it looks like it is not going to happen! How many times can he go free and what is it going to take for justice to be done. Thank you, Mary Gillespie

Ms. Perdue,
† I live in Davidson County and an appalled at the way Hugh Holliman is acting against us in the Lexington Annexation deal.† He refuses to set a Moritorium OR anything that would stop this mess.† Tony Rand thinks he's God in trashing any bill regarding annexation.† I think gov. needs to address the problems of the TAXPAYER not THEIR OWN POCKETS.† Areas in question† are not a wealthy area. We are either on SS or Diability and LOW income group of people.† We cannot due double taxing and especially when we don't need the city services.
There will also be an area that won't have fire protection at a certain date. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE by the citizens of Davidson County and we should not be thrown under the bus.
† Please give us help in this matter.† We have a group C U A F A† and need gov. help in this matter.
† A way to help the state balance it's budget is less GOVERNMENT and START at the TOP and LOWER GOVERNMENT PAY.† We taxpayers have to get a balance in out checkbooks and some live on less than $1000.† BUT TAXES ARE THE FIRST TO GET RAISED INSTEAD OF OUR OFFICIALS TAKING CUTS IN PAY TO DO THEIR PART.
†Thanks for reading this IF you do. I would like a personal ans. from you NOT A FORM letter. We are suppose to be able to communicate with those who gov..

Subject: Sponsorship for The National Medicare RAC Summit in D.C.

Comment: My name is Stephanie Lillard and I voted for you in the November 2008 election because I believe in your platform initiatives especially the ones that relate to health care. I would like to represent the state of North Carolina at The National Medicare RAC Summit in Washington, DC. which focuses on revenue recovery from providers or hospitals that incorrectly submitted claims to Medicare. As a result, the third party contractors who work for the government are recouping billions of dollars all over the country which has impacted several providers and hospitals because the fines and penalties are severe. I want to insulate the state of North Carolina from having to pay fines or penalties to Medicare. We need our health care providers to service the medical needs of all communities. http://www.racsummit.com/registration.html This conference (website listed above) will provide vital education and certifications to the attendees of this conference. The speakers at the conference are leaders who have been awarded contracts to act on behalf of Medicare. These speakers will inform us about the audit process, steps to ensure billing accuracy, how to protect your organization through comprehensive compliance programs, and the most common billing errors that frequently audited. Also, the institutions in North Carolina are scheduled to go through this RAC (Recovery Audit) process in 2010. In conclusion, the cost of the conference is $2485.00 which does not include hotel or flight and I do not have all of the funds to go to the conference. I am asking for your help in sponsoring me to attend this conference. I current work for one of the most esteemed Healthcare System's in the nation and there have been some budgetary cuts which prevent me from being sponsored by my employer. Governor Perdue, I believe in our health care community and I want to keep it compliant. I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can provide me regarding this matter.

Hi Mrs. Perdue,



†My name is Tammy. I am writing you for advice. I have a friend that is suffering from Chrohns Disease. She has three children whom she loves dearly. They are all having a very hard time right now because of her sonís wife. They are separated and have been for a while now. This girl is harassing them and stalking my friendís son. My friend and her son have gone to the local sheriffís office and taken out papers for what she is doing. She has been to court and told not to have anything to do with the family and they put her on probation. Within 2 hours, she was calling the house and texting one of the daughters. She broke her probation so my friend went up there and took out more papers on her. She has several charges on her and until night before last no one has picked her up, and that was pure luck because she started coming by the house and they called the law. When she was released from jail yesterday morning, she then took stalking and harassment charges out on him. He hasnít done anything at all except try to go on with his life and this girl will not stop and leave him alone. The officers came to his house last night and arrested himÖ.they never worked that fast when papers were taken out on her. The system is messed up. Is it because she is a woman and if charges are taken out on a manÖ.then they work harder to pick them up? This girl has threatened his life but yet they couldnít get her on that because she didnít tell him personally Öshe told his parents. She is crazy and a threat to society. I am watching my best friend slowly deteoriate because of this young and disturbed lady. Please help me. I do not know the proper channels to go through since our local county officials are not doing their jobs. Please respond to me and let me know what she should do. Why donít we have laws in place like other states do concerning stalking? It should be a felony offense in the state of NC. She needs to be locked up for a long time before she actually hurts someone.







Thank you for your time.





Sincerely,





Tammy

Subject: Property Tax Value Increase

Comment: I would like an answer as to why my property tax value has increased by 33% (63,300). I have already posted my opinion on the cumberland county website. Other counties in NC are postponing this years reassessment to aid with the economic crisis. It would be nice for cumberland county to do the same. I believe this is an extremely irresponsible decision that needs to be corrected. If postponing tax value assessment is not an option, at least reducing the amount substantially would be welcomed.

Subject: UNC Chapel Hill Library Question

Comment: Governor Pur, I came across a publication written in the News and Observers today that gave much concern. At UNC Chapel Hill's Wilson library there is a fire code violation that is preventing people from accessing nearly 60% of the library. This fire code violation can only be resolved with a $10-12Million dollar restoration that the university does not have the funds for. I am writing to see if you or one of your colleagues may be able to assist this matter in any way possible. I visit UNC's House and Wilson libraries often and can tell you firsthand how significant keeping this selection open is. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Congratulations on your recent win! I voted for you and am so excited to see all the great things you can do for North Carolinas. I'm writting to you to ask for your support of the Towns-Reichert Chimp Protection Act. ABCNews.com broke the story of the more than 300 chimpanzees at the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) in Louisiana. The footage of NIRC was taken from a nine-month-long undercover investigation by The Humane Society of the United States.



Among these chimps are 26 elders who were taken decades ago from the wild. It's time to give these animals the sanctury they deserve.



At any given time, the vast majority of chimpanzees in laboratories are simply being warehoused, and not actually used in research. The approximately $20-25 million in taxpayer dollars per year spent to house, care for, and experiment on this endangered species could be better spent on other, more useful research endeavors.



I am very concerned about the use of these endangered animals for research which causes them harm. In addition to being highly social and emotional beings, chimpanzees have been shown to have amazing mental abilities such as tool use and problem solving skills. Given what we know about them, confinement in a laboratory is simply no place for a chimpanzee.



The United States is the only country, besides Gabon, that still uses chimpanzees in invasive research. The United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain have all banned or severely restricted the use of chimpanzees. Please help the U.S. join this list of nations by co-sponsoring The Great Ape Protection Act.



Thank you.

Dear Governor Purdue,

††† Why are you letting people in Cumberland County being discriminating against?
We are the only county being increased by 33%.
†††††††††††††††††††††† I live in the country where we have no public transportation available, no trash pick up, no road improvement, and for 5 families who have to go down Kansas Ct. to get to their homes, have to go down a dirt road with deep holes because it is a privet access road that none of us can afford to repair. SO, what do we get for out tax money- NOTHING. So why should we pay any tax at all? I am disabled and my only income is SSI, my husband was layed off over 4 months ago, with no responce to the many applications, or job fairs. At one on the job fairs he was told that with his backround Fort Bragg could use him in the mailroom, that was 2 months ago, still no response.
††††††††††††††††††††††† In my opinion, the tax and property increese is because, in 2010 over 40,000 troops are moving into our area and our officials feel that our country's defenders will pay more to move their families into the area.
††††††††††††††††††††††††† There are other ways to make money for our county. One example is to use the money from the government, not to just put new windows in the airport terminal, but used to expand our airport to be international. More people will fly into here, instead of RDU 1 1/2 hr away, which would mean lower air rates, more merchant income and get us up with the rest of the world, and unemployment will go down because thousands of jobs will be created.

††††††††††††††††††††††† I am going to send a copy of this to President Obama and to the Mayor of Fayetteville.

††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† I'm sorry that I have to send this to you but someone has to tell you what is going on. Many people feel this way. Not many have what it takes to tell someone.† I would really like to help you, my county, neighbors and friends, anywhy I can.† I would like to even get a patition together if you could tell me who to send it.†††
† † † † † † † † † † † † † †† Sincerely†† Patricia Jefferson, 2664 Kansas Ct. , Fayetteville, NC 28312, 910-221-9784

Subject: Cost of copies of documents at the Randolph Co. Clerk Of Court Office

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Congratulations regarding your becoming our Governor. The reason I am contacting you is that the cashier at the Randolph County Clerk Of Courts told me that you were the person to direct questions regarding the cost of copies of court documents. On Tuesday, March 3, 2009 I had to get copies of some court documents from the Randolph County Clerk Of Courts office due to a mistake that the Randolph County Court System made regarding my filing trespassing charges against an individual who trespassed on my Randolph County farm after a deer was illegally poached. When I called the Clerk Of Court's office earlier in the day, I was told that the charge for coping would be $2.00 for the first page and $.25 for each additional page. I had three pages copied, and I was charged $6.00 instead of $2.50. When I questioned the cost, citing the charges for copies I was told over the telephone by the Clerk's office, I was told that I was charged $6.oo due to each page that had copied was considered a separate document. I shared that I found the additional charges to be excessive and unfair. I then asked to whom I could voice my concerns; I was told I needed to contact the Governor. So, here I am contacting you. As I shared with the Randolph County Clerk Of Court Cashier, I find the charges of $6.oo for three pages of documents to be excessive and unfair. Especially since I needed the copies due to a mistake made by the Randolph County Court System. I would appeciate a refund of $3.50, plus a clarification regarding the cost of copies of documents at the Clerk Of Court's offices in North Carolina. I look forward to the refund and your timely response. Please note that this incident occurred in Randolph County. Thank you in advance for your assistance. Sincerely, Michael Thomas NC Native and Resident 2915 Adventist Circle Morganton, NC 28655

Comment: What is the law concerning this? I have contacted the local police, the highway patrol and the director of bus safety in Raleigh concerning this matter. There is alot of confusion that I feel needs to cleared up because all have said no/yes. They have refered me to the NC statue 20-142.3. which plainly says that they do have to stop with no exception listed for church/activity bus. If that is the case why is there so much confusion concerning this matter when lives could be lost? I would greatly appreciate your response to this matter to give me peace of mind and hopefully save lives. Thank you

Comment: I have contact everyone that represents nc including our past Governor Easley to no avail.. I believe a new law is in order for x felons who have been released from prison for murder that would make it mandatory for them to register in the community that they residing.Its a great idea that sex offenders must register and so should murderers. Its only fair to society to be aware . I know of a murderer who killed 2 women and tried to kill me,I was lucky. But he walks the streets again and I fear for any woman who gets involved with him. Can't something be done? I would like Bev Perdue to read my plea and respond to me .Thank You Maureen Wallace

I live in Alamance county.† They are conducting a re-appraisal of homes.† I was just informed that my house went from a value of 225000 in 2008 to a value of 288000 in 2009. (Home built in 2008)

This has made me very angry.† Given that we are in the worse times since the depression and the housing market has crashed to be told that my home increased in value by 60,000 in one year is insulting, ridiculous.

I am hurting - i pay my mortgage, i pay my credit cards. To have my county government to send me such a absurd increase is beyond† my understanding.

I can't begin to convey how frustrating things are. I did all the right things but my net worth is being destroyed and then i get an insulting letter that says my home value increased!!!!

If someone can look into what is going on in Alamance county that would be appreciated.

Thank-you

Subject: Involuntary annexation

Comment: Madame Governor: I live in an area that is in the process of being annexed into the city of Kinston. While I understand that cities need to "grow" I feel that the involuntary process being used erodes at the very heart of American freedoms--the right to own property and the right to vote. This decision is being made by a city council that I was not able to elect. This council has in its hands the power to raise my property taxes by $.66 per hundred. (Almost double what I pay now.) My neighborhood is filled with people 65 and older who have lived in their homes for over 30 years. With the economy as it is now, this annexation could not come at a worse time for us financially. While I understand that the change in this must come from the legislature, is there anything you can do to help us? Bringing new jobs and industries to the state and our cities is important. But it is also important for these industries to see how the people of our state are treated. Right now I feel like I am nothing more than an extra tax income for the city of Kinston. I feel like my very freedoms are being taken away by a body over which I have absolutely no say or control of. Thank you for listening. Please help us. Sincerely, Jennifer Spruill

Subject: A new law that needs to be created regarding minor children

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I have a heart wrenching story and I believe a law needs to be in effect to prevent what happened to me and my 3 year old son from happening to other parents and their children. I was married to a woman named Sheila Anderson for 2 years before we tried to have a child. The doctors told her she was not fertile, so we proceeded to get an egg donor and with my sperm, a fertalized egg was implanted in Sheila and she delivered baby James on 2-4-06. A few months later, Sheila wanted to go through the invitro-fertalization procedure again. As soon as Sheila was confirmed pregnant, she asked me to move out of our new home, that she wanted a divorce. I was shocked. I moved out, we signed a Separation Agreement, she then lost her job, & on 10-12-07 delivered a still born child. I had visitation with my son James, every other week end, & every Wednesday night. One Sunday when I had James, Sheila text me that she wanted to pick him up for a birthday party. I unwillingly agreed, as it cut short the time I could spend with my son. Two days later, I got another text from Sheila telling me that she had moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, & took James with her. My heart fell out of my chest. I immediately called the attorney who helped me with the Separation Agreement. He prepared a Court Order petitioning I get temporary custody of my son until we could have a custody hearing. Sheila did not let me see my son for a month, nor did she give me her address in Morgantown. Sheila did have to come back to Charlotte, NC for the hearing. The Judge did not grant me custody of my son, rather he Ordered visitation every other week end for me and James, until we could have a full custody hearing. I commuted for 6 months driving half way to West Virginia, eight hour car trips for me, my son and Sheila, every other week end. It was horrible. Worse, when I would have to give my son back to Sheila, he would cry, scream, not let go of my shirt. James carrying on like that broke my heart every time. I did not want to give him back to Sheila, but there was the Court Order. Now my son has told me he "he hates his mommy" that he wants to live with me. I explained about the Judge, and he said "I want to talk to the Judge". James is very smart for a 3 year old. Sheila is somewhat of a cold hearted person, I found out I was her 5th husband. She moved to Morgantown because she got a job as a Payroll Manager for Mylan Pharmacutical. She moved for self enrichment, with no real concern for James growing up so far from me. I believe she loves James as one might love a step-child, feed and dress them, kiss them on the forehead, but the love you have for your own flesh and blood is different, its more powerful. James looks like me, not a drop like Sheila, remember he doesn't have her DNA. I speak to James on the phone once a day & each time he sounds sad, crys, tells me he wants to see me, and I am so far away, it hurts so much. Is it fair that Sheila got away with parental kidnapping? That she gets to move my child from North Carolina, the state where we were married, where James was born? She breached our Separation Agreement. No penalty for her? James & I both suffer emotionally due to the distance between us, created by Sheila. I urge you to create a law that states: one parent may not move a child of the marriage more than sixty miles from the other parent, unless the parent being left behind agrees in writing. Had there been such a law, James & I would be able to see each other every Wednesday & every other week end. Divorce is hard enough on a child, but moving the child far from his or her other parent is just plain cruel and should not be allowed by law. I appreciate you looking into this matter. Sincerely, Phil Reccardi

Subject: Who approves the military in NC, on the way to Iraq?

Comment: Dear Governor, Thank you for allowing me to ask you a few questions. In the state of NC who is it who controls the military and their pay? The soldier was sent home with an injury he received in Mississippi during training from the heavy equipment he was carrying. At the end of the month he still received his pay but now the military is taking the money back from his drill check. He travels to Benson for drill because he is assigned there. His drill check is only $53 which is more than what it takes to ride to Benson.I hope that you can find time in your very busy schedule to look further into my situation because we still have bills. I think that it is wrong for them to give their life and jeopardize their relationships just to give it back. How can they take all of back? Thank You, Vanessa Lee

Comment: In the case of Venessa Mills #08CVD17753, I believe Judge Ned Mangum of Wake County should be removed from this ongoing case so as Mrs. Mills may receive a fair hearing, which is her right.

THE RESPONSE E-MAIL TO CROSS CREEK MALL ATTORNEY/FIRM BELOW: Mr. Moore: This e-mail is to confirm receipt of your letter that includes vague, general references to the alleged actions of me at Cross Creek Mall (the "Mall") that included curious omissions of any other peoples‚Äô actions and speech, including the harassment by the security staff and Fayetteville Police Department Officer Herrera. Neither did you include a copy of any documentation that will be subpoenaed: 1. You were not there, so as you know, your "story" is biased and untrue. The actions of the security staff, Officer Herrera, etc...being ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù is a natural response for an attorney representing the accused. 2. I never lie, so your caution "against making untruthful or inaccurate statements" are an attorney's "trick" at twisting the truth to benefit their client who pays you, thus, takes away any objectivity due to monetary and/or civil litigation reasons. The only slander and libel is by your clients, period. 3. The "various unrelated third-parties" that you refer to obviously display your lack of knowledge into what happened and is on-going. Thus, due to lack of knowledge, is not creditable. 4. Do not communicate with me via e-mail, letter, phone, etc...Except for the request of the documentation of the February 4th, 2009 "Mall" incident, not a threatening letter on libel/slander. If not sent to me via the Andersons, then it will be subpoenaed. This e-mail will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, and any references of yours on anything being "unrelated" does not dignify a response at this time. Please abide by these requests as I will save all documentation, phone messages, e-mails, etc.... Thank you, Gerry Lindgren 4 February 2009 Fayetteville Police Department (F.P.D.) Office of Professional Standards (O.P.S.) 467 Hay Street Fayetteville, NC 28301 Subject: F.P.D. HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EVENTS Dear O.P.S.: My name is Gerry Lindgren, (574.52.0295; State of NC ID #39146496), and I am writing to report the recent harassment and discrimination events that I have received this past week from some of the F.P.D. officers and will forward a copy of this letter to my attorney, Governor Perdue, the A.C.L.U. and the U.S. Senate and Congress due to pending civil action against the Los Angeles Police Department, West Hollywood Sheriff Department, Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, the Anchorage Police Department, Dunn, NC Police Department, and associated entities and individuals, public and private and am concerned with retaliation and targeted entrapment from the F.P.D. due to events that I am not at liberty to currently state. The most atrocious occurring on February 4, 2009 at Cross Creek Mall with Officer Hererra who was insolent, unprofessional, intimidating, and threatening with the African-American security guard of Cross Creek Creek Mall and there were many eyewitnesses. First, let‚Äôs chronologically, briefly address this past week, notwithstanding the incident in 2007. 1. On February 3, @ 8:20 p.m. E.S.T., I called 9/11 due to a large African American male threatening me with violence and F.P.D. Officers Black and Armstrong responded. Officer Black was very churlish and discourteous by treating me, the victim, like the aggressor by asking me why I was walking the streets of Fayetteville all day rather than taking the report and apprehending the aggressor who was standing a few yards away. I responded to him that I am unemployed, looking for work, had my resumes, have epilepsy and do not drive and was quite bewildered on why that would be an issue. I described the aggressor as a large black male with a fluffy black jacket. Officer Black was ill-mannered and kept repeating that I need a better description although I kept pointing to the man who was less than 20 yards away. Thus, I called 9/11 again and spoke with the Watch Commander and the 2 responding officers departed without stating anything. 2. On February 3 @ 12:29 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by F.P.D. Officer Chavez on Mcpherson Church Road/Collinwood (after the officer spoke with a male in a black S.U.V.) while seeking employment. 3. On February 4, 2009 @ 2:14 p.m., E.S.T., I was stopped by Officer Combs on Mcpherson Church Road (near the Olive Garden) while seeking employment. 4. On February 4 @ 3:30 p.m., E.S.T., I walked from the Olive Garden on Sycamore Dairy Road to Cross Creek Mall. I was only in for a few minutes and upon exiting, a women intentional knocked into me and I was verbally and physically harassed by the on-lookers referring to me with obscenities. I walked past them to the other entrance to make a report to security. As I entered, I walked by Officer Hererra who initially walked past me saying nothing. I stated that he ‚Äúmust stop having the public harass me‚Äù and he turned around and stopped and searched me. Then, the African-American Security Chief at Cross Creek Mall who has always given me a bad time joined in harassing me and claimed that people claimed that I yelled an obscenity (UNTRUE AND THEY PROVIDED NO EYEWITNESSES TO COLLOBORATE THEIR CLAIM AND NO WRITTEN DOCUMENT AND/OR AFFADAVIT). Then, Officer Hererra asked me to grab my property and go to the security room. As I was doing this, he screamed at me and threatened me, handling his gun. NOTE: I TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE EPILPSY. I ALSO HAVE AIDS AND ARC (AIDS RELATED COMPLICATIONS) THAT INCLUDE DISABLING PERIPHERAL-NEUROPATHY THAT AFFECTS THE HANDS AND FEET EXTREMITIES, AND IN SEVERE CASES LIKE MINE, IT AFFECTS THE ARMS, LEGS AND WALKING IN ADDITION TO SEVERE ARTHRITIS SINCE CHILDHOOD AND DIFFICULTY WITH UNCONTROLLED BOWELL MOVEMENTS DUE TO THESE ILLNESSES AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ARE DOCUMENTED, MOST RECENTLY ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY 2009 WITH DR. CHIMA AT SOUTHER REGIONAL A.H.E.C., AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS EXCEPT FOR EPILEPSY. 5. On the way to the inside the Cross Creek Mall Security, there were many eyewitnesses, mostly military personnel, who witnessed the harassment of Officer Hererra threatening me to walk faster and ready to assault me. Inside the Security Room, the African-American Security Chief slammed the door on my right shoulder while Officer Hererra was standing right behind me so close that I could feel his breathing on my neck. The African-American security guard banned me for one year after I refused to sign his deceitful and duplicitous document that left the omissions of how everything started with no due process to challenge any of the lies and specifically mentioned that if I went to the Bank of America, that I would be arrested. Subsequently, I called 9/11 again to speak with on of the 2 Watch Commanders, so I was transferred to the Cross Creek one who came on duty @ 3:00 p.m., E.S.T., Lieutenant Kelly who incredulously stated to me to ‚Äúgo see a doctor ‚Äú and hung up the phone on me. I called again and he repeated the same infantile comments. Later, at 5:00 p.m., E.S.T., I called for an apology and he denied speaking to me or even knowing about the Cross Creek Mall incident even though he was the on-duty (although he is unfit for duty) Watch Commander for this specific location. Then, the African-American security chief, numerous other security guards with hands on and near their weapons, along with Officer Hererra, walked me all the way to Skibo Road, even following in vehicles that seemed quite excessive with numerous outside eyewitnesses as I did not disobey, I repeat, I did not disobey any order other than telling them that attempting to force me to sign a document, especially one filled with falsehoods, is illegal and this angered them. 6. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peripheral-neuropathy ‚Ä¢ Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove. ‚Ä¢ Peripheral neuropathy can result from such problems as traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of the disorder is diabetes. ‚Ä¢ In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time ‚Äî especially if it's caused by an underlying condition that can be resolved. Medications initially designed to treat other conditions, such as epilepsy and depression, are often used to reduce the painful symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms Your nervous system is divided into two broad categories. Your central nervous system consists of your brain and spinal cord. All the other nerves in your body are part of your peripheral nervous system, which includes: ÔÇß Sensory nerves to receive feelings such as heat, pain or touch ÔÇß Motor nerves that control how your muscles move ÔÇß Autonomic nerves that control such automatic functions as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder function Most commonly, peripheral neuropathy begins in the longest nerves ‚Äî the ones that reach to your toes. Specific symptoms vary, depending on which types of nerves are affected. Signs and symptoms may include: ÔÇß Gradual onset of numbness and tingling in your feet or hands, which may spread upwards into your legs and arms ÔÇß Burning pain ÔÇß Sharp, jabbing or electric-like pain ÔÇß Extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch ÔÇß Lack of coordination ÔÇß Muscle weakness or paralysis if motor nerves are affected ÔÇß Bowel or bladder problems if autonomic nerves are affected ÔÇß Causes ÔÇß A number of factors can cause neuropathies. These factors include: ÔÇß Autoimmune diseases. These include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. ÔÇß Other diseases. Kidney disease, liver disease and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) also can cause peripheral neuropathy. Patients with HIV/AIDS also are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy. ÔÇß Inherited disorders. Examples include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyloid polyneuropathy. I respectfully request an inquiry into this incident and why anyone who may or may not have complained about me was not mentioned or corrective action to them due to harassing me by calling me ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù and pushing me that initiated the whole incident in addition to the rescinding of the 1-year ban as I will forward this letter to the following businesses at Cross Creek Mall. Sincerely, Gerry Lindgren c/o Andersons‚Äô 7896 King Road Fayetteville, NC 28306 910.423.7855

Subject: Judge Magnum's misconduct in case #08CVD17753

Comment: Judge Magnum, ignoring the best interest of the children in a divorce case, has decided that the children must not continue homeschooling and now must attend public school. The lives of the children have already been torn apart by their parents divorce, now they will have to change their method of education despite the fact evidence was introduced in court that they we thriving in the homeschooling environment. The father in this case even testified that the kids were doing well but now he does not want to pay for the children to continue homeschooling. No reasonable reason for changing their right to homeschool was given by the judge, going against the status quo of the family. The children should be allowed to continue their life with as little as possible interruption to their lives. It deeply disturbs me that the right of a parent to choose homeschooling as a viable alternative for education is being dismissed based on unsubstantiated bias on the part of a judge. Homeschooling is legal in North Carolina. Many families choose this method of education and many of the children go on to college or military careers. A new judge needs to be appointed to this case that will obey the spirit of the law and give this family a fair hearing. Laws are there to assure that all citizens are treated fairly rather than on the whim of a judge.

Subject: please introduce this to become law

Comment: I would like to see a federal law in place for anyone that is in the USA and working should have to pay taxes state and federal.I beleive this may be to simple,I am frustrated and angry with the gov. allowing people in and not making them pay federal taxes and being able to receive gov. assitance with out ever having to pay into the gov.. I beleive a good law would be that anyone who comes in the country and are working should have to pay taxes at the state and federal level regardless of citizenship. With high unemployment levels and outsourcing of jobs that are available.As an american I would like to offer this suggestion and not allow anyone to receive benefits unless you have been paying state and federal taxes for at least ten years if you are not an american citizen, I have heard of for more than one occation that if your not from america people have taken more children down to social services to drain our tax dollars with welfare and because they are not from here they do not have to prove anything except,just from their word of how many kids they have and tax payers are not getting refunded for their expenses because they say the fathers have moved back to their country and they do not have to prove this because they as well are not american citizens. I would like to state that I personally have been to the housing projects in durham installing dish network and have personally seen whole families receiving free housing and brand new cars and trucks in the parking lot with signs on the side of them {ex. construction and roofing} on the sides of the trucks that are living in free housing and I am sure receiving benefits out of N.C. budget. I would like to see these practices stopped as a N.C. tax payer as well as lots of other tax payers around the country. Please give me your thoughts on this matter? It is a hard thing to swallow seeing these same people starting business driving brand new cars and we the tax payers are paying for them to live off of welfare.

Subject: immigration issues

Comment: First of all let me kinda explain my situation: My husband is Mexican that came to America on a student visa and never got it renewed. We have 3 children together ages 1, 3 and 5. I myself am a caucasian that was born in Jackson, Miss. My husband was arrested in Catawba county on a misdemeanor charge that was dismissed by the state the first time that it went to court. Before his court date though his fingerprints were ran via the 287g program and the results came back that he was not legal, although we are in the process of getting his permenant residency. This whole situation has caused devistation to our family. I am a homemaker that has always stayed at home with the kids. My husband has always worked and supported the family. Our whole life and everything that we have worked to have is just going down the drain. This is sending us into poverty. Everytime that our lawyer files for a bond hearing Immigration transfers my husband to a different jurisdiction and they can not do a bond hearing. I don't know what I am supposed to do. I am afraid that this will affect our children in a bad way too. I am afraid that this will cause them to grow up hating the government and I don't want that for them. The government is supposed to help us. This is not only a situation that is affecting my family. It affects approximately 5 million children across the United States that are US citizens with an Immigrant parent. I know that it is a very long shot but I am asking for help from anyone and everyone. I don't want my children to grow up without their father being in their lives. I don't want to have to live in shelters because I can't afford to live in my house anymore. I beg of you. PLEASE HELP!

Subject: S. 22

Comment: The Omnibus Public Land Act of 2009 is expected to come to the floor soon. I urge you to oppose this bill if, as expected, the leadership does not allow an amendment to repeal the anti-gun regulations of the National Park Service. Recent changes made by the Interior Department only allow persons with a concealed carry permit to possess a self-defense firearm on NPS land. Non-permit holders are still prohibited from carrying a firearm for their protection. And please don't be fooled by a supposedly pro-gun amendment to "fix" the bill that was brought up last week during the House debate on S. 22. That language only modestly protects hunting and recreational shooting. While protecting the rights of sportsmen is important, the Second Amendment is NOT about hunting rights. I am more concerned about my ability to defend my life, and the lives of my loved ones, than I am about plinking cans. Congressional leaders have been ambiguous about how this legislation will come to the floor, but my message to you is clear: protect ALL of my Second Amendment rights. Please OPPOSE final passage on any land bill that does not repeal the NPS gun ban. Sincerely, Robert Cordova

Subject: Senior Citizen Taxes

Comment: Why doesn't someone please reply to my inquiries on this subject? If my military pension check is not counted as income for state tax purposes, then why do you allow Counties to count it when trying to qualify for low income property taxes. I am paying about 35 percent of my retirement check for property taxes. Am I just suppose to vacate the home I worked so hard so I could live through my retirement age? Please help us.

Subject: HR 1388

Comment: Dear Ms Purdue, HR 1388, will hit the House floor sometime today. It is called the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act (The Give Act.) The House is scheduled to Rule this week. Sponsored by Democrat Representative Carolyn McCarthy (NY), Education and Labor Committee. The objective is to reauthorize and reform the national service laws. From the Misc. section, #6104: (6) "Whether a workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic, ethnic, and educational backgrounds." Someone should remind Congress and Mr. Obama that Mr. Lincoln freed the slaves. While they are at it, they should also tell this Constitutional scholar that the Constitution now forbids involuntary servitude: Amendment XIII Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. The Republican Party got rid of slavery 143 years (and a bloody Civil War) ago. And the Democrats have been working ever since to bring it back. It should be noted that when this "service" program was mention during Obama's campaign it sounded quite "voluntary." There was even a financial incentive promised. Now this servitude has been CHANGED to a REQUIREMENT. Mandatory = involuntary, which means it is unconstitutional to require anyone including youth, to serve in any manner. While I realize this administration would like to eliminate our Constitution, the fact remains that it does exist, and MANY of us are aware of it's contents. Therefore, if you are asked to vote on this issue, you must vote NO to HR 1388 as it is unconstitutional. In order to continue my support I request that you vote to defeat this bill. I will be watching your vote very closely on this matter. Expecting Your Support,

Subject: Request For Help

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue March 11, 2009 My name is Lynne V. Bryant and I am writing you this letter in an attempt to notify and eventually receive the assistance and fair treatment that I feel as a United States citizen deserves to be treated fairly and without bias in a court of law. I have been seeking aid and protection through the Cumberland County legal system of Fayetteville NC, for the past two years after being harassed, continuously stalked and eventually assaulted by my neighbor. Pedro Rios is a thirty-six year old white/Hispanic male that the United States Government has trained in Special Forces has been stalking me and harassing my family since his return from Afghanistan in 2006. Mr. Rios began his stalking and terrorism of my family aggressively after I told him to stop coming to my home at all hours of the night waking my family with bogus complaints of my dogs barking. I also asked him to stop approaching me and my children dressed in nothing but a pair of very short boxers and wearing no shirt. I felt it was inappropriate for him to approach young girls ages 11, 13, and 14 dressed in that manner. I was also made to feel very uncomfortable when he approached me dressed in that way because it could be clearly seen he was wearing no underwear under these boxers. Mr. Rios began to make complaints on me in an attempt to get me to drop specific charges of video stalking and trespass I had filed against him. Mr. Rios came to my home one night around 4am and damaged my new car and then told me the very next day he had done it. When I called the Fayetteville police for their assistance I was told there was nothing they could do about it because I didn‚Äôt see him do it. One of Mr. Rios methods of stalking me was to climb a ladder to look over the six foot fence I have around my back yard to take photographs of me, my dogs and my yard. These photos were use in court by the state district attorney for reasons that are still very unclear to me other than to invade the rights I have to privacy. Mr. Rios would verbally attack me by also call me nasty insulting names while he was on this ladder looking into my back yard while baring his half naked body to me over the fence. He would stand in his garage and video record me as I would be coming into my home or while I was sitting in my car or while I was in my yard or on my porch. Mr. Rios would stand in between our homes and video record through my dining room window doing this with a police officer standing right beside him. This same police officer threatened me one evening to the point of putting his hand in the position of his weapon and beckoning me to assault him. Mr. Rios pulled his car in front of my home and while he was sitting in his car he began to make a gun gesture with his hands at me as if he was shooting a gun at me. While driving down Cliffdale Rd., the road leading to our housing area Mr. Rios has tried to run my daughters off the road and has also aggressively drove bumper to bumper with me and cut out from behind me only to cut back into the same lane in front me so close he could have cause me to hit him. He has fired a gun out into his back yard trying to intimidate and terrorize me. There are so many more incidents of Mr. Rios abusive and intimidating behavior towards me and my family. Each time I have filed charges against Mr. Rios for his harassment the courts have ignored them and charged me. I have attempted to receive a restraining order against Mr. Rios only for it to be denied by a judge who disregarded my right to equal protection. I have been arrested falsely for failure to appear in court when I was not notified of a court appearance date. I was placed on probation for one year by judges who totally disregarded my rights to live in peace, privacy and the right to protect my family and myself from danger when one night Mr. Rios tried to break in my front door and placed my 4 year-old grandson in danger of serious injury. The night Mr. Rios did this I defended my family and ran him away from us and kept him away until the police came. When the police arrived, whom I had called, they threaten to arrest me for assaulting Mr. Rios with a flower pot. The courts ignore all the wittiness I had that described what this man had done and how he was threatening and cursing at me while he was standing in front of my door on my property. I feel I have been treated as a slave of the state of North Carolina who dose not have the right to be heard in a court of law or to enjoy privileges and protections provided to me as a United States citizen as provided by the US Constitution . I have been convicted by the use of false evidence. I was denied to see evidence brought against me by a judge in the Cumberland County court because the evidence was false and the dates of incidents were false. The mental strain and stress that has been placed upon me has been carried out not only by Mr. Rios but has been fully aided by the judges that have heard the cases put before them. When this case reached court the judge who presided over this case was very degrading towards me he accused me of drinking or being on drugs and of being an unfit human. He was very comfortable in doing this because at the time I was the only black in the courtroom out of about sixteen people. I was placed on probation and a restraining order was placed against me to not go near Mr. Rios when it was establish by the judge himself that I had never approached Mr. Rios and that Mr. Rios was constantly coming on to my property at all hours of the night. I appealed the decision but was still place on one year probation for protecting my family and I from an aggressive attacker. While I was on this probation Mr. Rios continued to harass and stalk me which can be proved through the probation office here. He would contact the probation office in charge of my supervision and also the supervisor of the probation office with bogus complaints. On February 16, 2008 after filing assault charges against Mr. Rios for attacking me on my property a Cumberland County judge once again disregarded the charges I had placed on Mr. Rios and found me guilty on counter charges filed by Mr. Rios, sentencing me to 18 months of probation for crimes I never committed. Not only was I found guilty once again on counter charges of revenge but the judge told me I needed mental and physiological help. This was an insult and another form of mental abuse carried out by a legal official. I also have been ordered by this judge to pay restitution for property that in a clear view of any fair minded individual could not have made such a decision I feel the stalking Mr. Rios had carried out on me and my family has been aided by the racist and bias decisions of the Cumberland County court by the lack of fairness and equality. I have been unjustly punished because of seeking protection from the law. I am desperately requesting assistance with this detrimental matter and any assistance or guidance that your division can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Signed Lynne V. Bryant 7152 Dayspring Drive Fayetteville NC 28314 Home Phone 910-717-4675 Cell Phone 910-263-2174 EMAIL Sapiental1@AOL.COM
