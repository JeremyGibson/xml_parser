On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov.

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov.

Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C.

‚ÄúThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.‚Äù

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov.

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolina‚Äôs Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolina‚Äôs University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005.

Stop spending time on stupid issues and pay more attention to important ones.  Stop complaining about the schools lack of money and stop busing kids from all over.  That will save enough money.  Use common since.

As someone who voted for Governor Perdue, I've been very happy with all of her initiatives, up till usurping NC Education Lottery funds for other purposes. The lottery would not have been approved by voters except that it was to be earmarked for education.

Please rescind the recent redistribution of education lottery funds. This decision was, in my opinion, ill-advised.

Sincerely,
Nancy Orban

Dear Governor Perdue,



Thank you for the letter you sent to the recent meeting held at Moyock Middle School.† Your opposition to the proposed Camden OLF is appreciated, but your presence would be more demonstrative.†



Additionally, please unite the state representatives, of which you, Sen. Basnight, and Rep. Owens are a part of, in a similar manner as our much appreciated Federal elected officials.† Their united stance is well known, vocal, and heartfelt.† I do not get the same feeling from you and our state reps.† You appear to be afraid of losing federal money.† Please make the stand as you indicated in your campaign.† Your†vocal opposition to this ridiculously unneeded proposal is key to finding a better alternative.† (Utilizing the†bombing range area in Dare County is the best alternative I've heard.)†



Respectfully,



Gary Davis

Moyock

State of the State Address

Governor Perdue will address the state from the North Carolina House Chamber on Monday evening at 7pm.† She will discuss the challenges facing North Carolina and her plans to move our state forward during these tough times.

You can watch the address live online at <http://www.governor.state.nc.us>http://www.governor.state.nc.us.†


Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolinaís education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

ìThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolinaís public schools forward,î said Gov. Perdue. ìOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.î


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

ìThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.î

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

ìAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,î said Governor Perdue. ìTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.î

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolinaís Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolinaís University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolina‚Äôs education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.‚Äù


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

‚ÄúThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.‚Äù

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

‚ÄúAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,‚Äù said Governor Perdue. ‚ÄúTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.‚Äù

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolina‚Äôs Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolina‚Äôs University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

Thanx for the info about the Address being given Monday!!† Tell me where can we go to offer suggestions
to Governor Purdue or any of the legislators by seeing the HBills being considered or new ones needing
a step up. We care so much about the abuse of laws to "protect" the elderly and the innocent domestic
animals. Refer us to these so we can offer suggestions to encourage better-quality laws for such "minor-
ities" to survive in North Carolina...anyway.

I will continue to make contact with the office of the governor until I receive I response.



I understand our new governor is very busy and I want to accommodate that.



I need to set up a brief meeting to speak with Governor Perdue concerning a North Carolina State owned historic property in critical condition.† This is absolutely not an issue that can wait.

I am very disappointed that Governor Purdue continues to state publicly that NC has a severe deficit; however, she has created a new position to oversee public schools in NC (that's paid six figures), when NC voters elected Dr. June Atkinson. If we are in such a financial crisis, then why create this job/position??? As a public school teacher, this is very concerning to me.

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov.

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov.

I am encouraged in many respects with the leadership seen in our new governor. We hope she can keep all her promises and trim where necessary to have all departments remain solvent and functioning for the good of the people of our great state. The monies in the state lottery must remain as intended with the tremendous aid to public schools. We are living in very tough times economically and we need to continue to fund education at the same or greater level than we have up to this point. The answer to the success of our precious children's future is not all about using their education funds for other purposes but to continue to fund education at the present level or greater. Much discussion has gone on about the level of education we need to achieve in North Carolina to meet national standards and improve North Carolllina's ability to compete in this country and internationally as well. To accomplis this we must fund the education program for our children. I am sure you agree they are the most precious thing we have for a bright future. Don't change the state†lottery monies. Floyd Mattoon.

Sorry, but I am not in favor of using proceeds from the Lottery, for the general funding of state business. It was promised to be for Education.
( Deep down I knew it would happen, as I am a transplant [ 71/2 yrs. ] from NY ).

	Two issues with you and your fellow communist/socialist friends....first:† having a "ceo" for the public instruction office is absolutely unconstitutional.† You know it is.† But you don't care so long as you can whittle away our God given freedoms and take what is not yours from the North Carolina People.† We voted as citizens of North Carolina for who we wanted for Superintendent of Public Instruction; June Atkinson.† We the people have decided we desire to use the system in place to continue.† Putting in place someone that was not elected by the people of NC takes the people out of the equation.† We the People of NC are suppose to be part of the process of running the government!† You have taken we the People out of that process.† By the way, paying him twice as much as the one that was elected for that position is absolutely ludicrous.† I thought you were concerned about budget short falls, but you continue to grow the budget with total disregard to our constitution and what we have elected.†† Secondly,† keeping people from getting their income tax refunds is immoral.† This is not your money.† It was in essence, a free loan and should be given back immediately.† You have not the right to keep it for any length of time longer than necessary.† How do people like you get into government?† If you're not completely without competence and common sense, than you are just plain thieves and dishonest about all you do.† Give the People of North Carolina back the right to chose their superintendent of Public Instruction as outlined by the North Carolina Constitution, and give us back our overpayment of state taxes!† And do it now!† Remember, you are our servant, and not the other way around!

Dear Governor Perdue,
Why is Camp Woodson being considered for termination?? or change??
It is the only alternate situation for children who are in trouble with the law in North Carolina.† It has a 78% rate (proven†in 2008) that the children it serves do not return to crime.† It has been†successful for thirty years.† †PLEASE do something for the children!† Some of these children this is their only chance at a future.
The staff is caring and do this not for the money because they do not make much.†
They do this for the children.† The children that most throw away.
Please check the figuires and the children saved.† Yes, it is expensive but housing a criminal is more expensive and for longer time.
Thank you for reading,
Alice Silver

Please ask the Governor to consider personally asking Sen. Hagan to oppose the upcoming vote on a bill which would eliminate the right-to-work and secret ballot procedure of North Carolina's labor laws†and inject the card-check system† thereby subjecting workers to intimidation and coercion by union organizers . Any company that deserves to be organized can be organized by the secret ballot process which maintains a level playing field between management and labor . In this economy North Carolina cannot afford to forfeit the competitive advantage that our right-to-work law provides us . Thanks , Watts Carr†

Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolinaís education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

ìThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolinaís public schools forward,î said Gov. Perdue. ìOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.î


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

ìThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.î

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

ìAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,î said Governor Perdue. ìTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.î

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolinaís Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolinaís University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

Thanks for the reply but†you totally ignored my question. I ask the Govenor not to except any stimulus
money from Obama due to the fact we would be obligated to carry out his agenda which will put us closer
to a socialist nation.

Please represent the people not the politicians.

State of the State Address

Governor Perdue will address the state from the North Carolina House Chamber on Monday evening at 7pm.† She will discuss the challenges facing North Carolina and her plans to move our state forward during these tough times.

You can watch the address live online at <http://www.governor.state.nc.us>http://www.governor.state.nc.us.†


Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolinaís education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

ìThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolinaís public schools forward,î said Gov. Perdue. ìOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.î


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

ìThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.î

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

ìAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,î said Governor Perdue. ìTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.î

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolinaís Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolinaís University System.

I am a teacher (32 years experience) in New Hanover County.  I was so happy to vote for Bev and am grateful to have a governor with public education experience!
I was horrified to hear the Education Lotery has been deverted from educational use!  What is that about?  Please explain.
Sincerely,

Governor Perdue,
I hope your new team will truly move away from the political turmoil and put roads in areas of the state where they are desperately needed.† The funding to complete the 485 outerbelt around Charlotte is way overdue.†† If Charlotte†and NC are†to compete with other large areas of the Southeast, †we need†to find monies to fund our roads and transportation.† †Thank you and I truly hope you will†keep the people working on these committees accountable.
Ella Heath

Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolinaís education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

ìThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolinaís public schools forward,î said Gov. Perdue. ìOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.î


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

ìThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.î

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.


Governor appoints†policy leadership team

This week Governor Perdue announced she is appointing Al Delia as Policy Director and Mike Arnold as Deputy Policy Director.

ìAl and Mike will form a fantastic team,î said Governor Perdue. ìTheir in-depth knowledge of North Carolina policy will serve as an asset to my office and to our state.î

Mr. Delia has over 20 years of experience in working effectively with boards and advisory groups and collaborating with diverse sets of workforce, economic development and educational organizations.† Before accepting the position as policy director, Mr. Delia, 48, served as president and CEO of North Carolinaís Eastern Region Development Commission. In this role he oversaw plans for business recruitment, retention, expansion and creation for a 13-county region. Prior to his work at the Eastern Region Development Commission, Mr. Delia spent†20 years working in economic development for North Carolinaís University System.

Mr. Arnold, 37, served as policy director in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor since 2005. During this time he worked with members of the NC General Assembly, advocacy groups and organizations, constituents and other federal, state and local stakeholders to help the Lieutenant Governor implement her policy agenda. Mr. Arnold was directly responsible for researching and developing policy initiatives for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

Governor Signs First Bill into Law

On Wednesday, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/03/04/My-first-bill-signing.aspx>Gov. Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolinaís education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††
ìThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolinaís public schools forward,î said Gov.

Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.
ìThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.î
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov.

Dear Gov. Perdue: I do not agree with making another CEO for EDucation.
I voted for Atkinson and want her to be the suptd. It looks like
you're just creating what already exists. I think we should respect
the elected official and not be creating more political appointees.
What are you up to? I don't like it and it looks wasteful and
duplitious.† I am school librarian who works every election for
Democrats but I think this is not a wise way to run education
in NC. Does any state have such a similar structure/mess to run education?--mp

Mrs. Perdue,

I applaud your efforts on attempting to streamline in NC's governmental system, but there seems to be a conflict in interest.† How can one person hold a CEO and Chair position and increase transparency in any organization?† Something†does not seem†right!

Just a thought,

Bev Perdue signed a bill into law that lays the foundation for her major restructuring in education leadership.† Senate Bill 198 is the first piece of legislation signed into law by Gov. Perdue.† The act modifies the restrictions on service on the State Board of Education by allowing a second North Carolina public schools employee to serve on the State Board.† The new law enables the governor to restructure and streamline North Carolina‚Äôs education leadership and allows Dr. Bill Harrison to serve both as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the State Board of Education.††

‚ÄúThis new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina‚Äôs public schools forward,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúOur schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.‚Äù


Governor announces DOT decision-making reforms

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue announced the new professional decision-making process for the N.C. Department of Transportation as called for in <http://www.governor..state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Executive Order No. 2, which she signed on her first day in office.† The new process transforms the approval process and will improve efficiency, openness and make decisions more strategic. Under the reform initiative, NCDOT professionals will determine project priorities based on data and input from local government and planning groups.† The appointed N.C. Board of Transportation will set transportation policy.

‚ÄúThis new professional decision-making for transportation projects aims at taking politics out of the process,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThe new process will increase accountability and openness and ensure that transportation projects are prioritized appropriately.‚Äù

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>On Jan. 12, Gov. Perdue issued Executive Order No. 2 as part of her first day of change orders, which required Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to implement a professional approval process for highway construction projects within 60 days.† The order also directed the Board of Transportation to delegate the Secretary authority to award highway construction contracts.
