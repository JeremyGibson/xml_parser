Balancing the State Budget



Fellow citizens,



The global economic downturn, credit crunch and overall volatility in the financial markets have had a significant impact on our state budget.† The Office of State Budget and Management expects a budget shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion.



We are carefully monitoring the situation and working to find solutions.† Governor Perdue is committed to balancing the budget, and to doing so responsibly.†



Last week she <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=22>ordered state agencies to cut their budgets up to 7%, but as she has said, ìweíre not going to eat our seed corn.î† Schools, health care, mental health and public safety will be spared the worst.



Additionally, the Governor ordered 1) a stop to purchases of goods and services ñ except for materials required in the classrooms, 2) limits on travel, 3) a hold on pay-as-you-go appropriations for capital improvements, and 4) a freeze on hiring for vacant positions.



<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>Click here to see details about the cuts.



As State Budget Director it is my job to assist Governor Perdue in creating a state budget that meets its constitutional obligation.†† Itíll take making tough decisions ñ which we have already begun ñ but we will balance the state budget.





Charlie Perusse

State Budget Director

Dear Governor,

I am a die hard Republican but made a significant contribution to your campaign.

I urge you to lower the NC income tax immediately and provide a zero percent capital gains rate.  This would stimulate economic growth in NC.  The logic is simple...if you give a high income individual a tax cut, he can use the money to save jobs.  Most all of our businesses are flow through entities...please lower personal income tax rates to 4 percent asap.  We MUST give the wealthy (ie business owners) more cash flow so they do not have to choose between providing for themselves and keeping employees.

I would be happy to meet with you to discuss.

The govenor campaigned on schools. She should keep them at the 3 percent minimum.. We are not going to forget that because of a couple of heartfelt emails. This is the moment where we decide if we cqn trust her. I think trust is important.  How does she view trust. I guess we will see.

Balancing the State Budget


Fellow citizens,




Thank you, DOT Road Crews!

This week many areas of our state were hit with significant snowfall.  Some areas had more than others - some parts of the Triangle had up to 6 inches of snow.

But Department of Transportation crews worked around the clock before and after the snowstorm to clear our roads.  They went about their tasks orderly and without fanfare, and did a great job minimizing impact on our roads.  They deserve our thanks for a job well done.

The Office of State Budget and Management expects a budget shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion.

We are carefully monitoring the situation and working to find solutions.  Governor Perdue is committed to balancing the budget, and to doing so responsibly.

Last week she ordered state agencies to cut their budgets up to 7%, but as she has said, "we're not going to eat our seed corn."† Schools, health care, mental health and public safety will be spared the worst.

Additionally, the Governor ordered 1) a stop to purchases of goods and services - except for materials required in the classrooms, 2) limits on travel, 3) a hold on pay-as-you-go appropriations for capital improvements, and 4) a freeze on hiring for vacant positions.

Click here to see details about the cuts.

As State Budget Director it is my job to assist Governor Perdue in creating a state budget that meets its constitutional obligation.   It'll take making tough decisions - which we have already begun - but we will balance the state budget.

in 1992 NC has a similar shortfall† $1.2 billion. The balanced budget was split between spending and tax increase of upper income and corporate income taxes (which was reversed since then)† If the tax cuts in the last few years had been left the shortage would not have been so great.† However, the cuts were more possible since they had not had 8 years of cuts like the last 8 years.† You might want to confer with Dan Blue and Henson Barnes, they broker the budget.

While, †I appreciate the need to balance the budget and as a strong supporter of the Governor I would just like to point out I strongly disagree with a hiring freeze. One of the things that will help our difficult economy is the creation of more jobs. As a person personally impacted by the economic lay-offs I would find any additional job opportunities to be beneficial. Fear of not having a job or people not actually having a job is leading to people reducing their out put. Reduction in out put is leading to a stagnet economy.† What we need to do is†create jobs. If the†government reacts in fear it will help†to continue the downward spiral out state is facing.

Thank you,
Robin Sinton †

Honorable Governor Purdue:

I'm not sure now is the best time to really emphasize balancing the state budget.  The state needs to work hard at job creation, not cutting jobs in this difficult economic environment.  Creating jobs, especially in higher education and in research, is a way to attract talent to our state and to improve the tax base.  

Please consider that for every dollar the state spends to hire a person, most of that money flows back into the state's economy, some of it directly in the form of tax revenue.  I propose a vigorous job creation program.  At least we should maintain the current level of state employees and services, possibly with modest increases, and begin a vigorous public works program.  The state could pay for these programs through tax-free ( or incentivized) bonds, a 1 % sales tax increase, and modest increases in the upper brackets of state income tax.  After the economy revitalizes, it will be easier to pay off the bonds, and the sales tax rate could be reduced again.

But please, don't cut state government spending now.  If you do, you're only contributing to the downward spiral in which the whole nation currently finds itself.

best wishes,
Brad Hunnicutt

Good job!† It is good to hear that we once again have a responsible administration overseeing our budget.† We are praying that President Obama will increase the amount of aid going towards infrastructure, and less towards tax relief.† The Republicans don't seem to realize that their penchant for tax cuts contributed in large part to the total financial mess our country is in.

This is to Charlie Perusse
NC State Budget Director

If you want to balance the budget on a shoe string and maintain all departments at staff, give me a call on my cell: 910 916-6990. You need to inspire people to come to the aid of their state and country. Let's show the federal government how to do this so they can benchmark against us.

Thanks for all you do,

Carl

Your wrong in your allocations, schools are the biggest waste of money. If we are so short, then new schools should be built with safety equipment like monitors and fire systems, but without the "over the top" items like new gyms, fancy decorating, etc. Next if we are so short we need to eliminate all the non-acedemic programs like atheltics, band, drama, etc. Let's get back to "reading, writing, and arithmatic." I realize that much of this is supposedly controlled by local school systems, but if the state cut funding for the excesses local government would not be able to afford to do it. We also need to do something to get our youth in better physical shape, therfore we need to plan lunches with no fried foods, high sugar foods, or heavy on the breads. Also we need to require every student unless they have documented physical limitations to participate in at least 45 minutes of conditioning drills every day. It's time we quite wasting our limited money on items that are really not needed. Thanks, Ken Andrews

Balancing the State Budget


Fellow citizens,


Thank you, DOT Road Crews!

This week many areas of our state were hit with significant snowfall.† Some areas had more than others ‚Äì some parts of the Triangle had up to 6 inches of snow.

But Department of Transportation crews worked around the clock before and after the snowstorm to clear our roads.† They went about their tasks orderly and without fanfare, and did a great job minimizing impact on our roads.† They deserve our thanks for a job well done.

Governor Bev Perdue
The global economic downturn, credit crunch and overall volatility in the financial markets have had a significant impact on our state budget.† The Office of State Budget and Management expects a budget shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion.

We are carefully monitoring the situation and working to find solutions.† Governor Perdue is committed to balancing the budget, and to doing so responsibly.†

Last week she ordered state agencies to cut their budgets up to 7%, but as she has said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to eat our seed corn.‚Äù† Schools, health care, mental health and public safety will be spared the worst.

Additionally, the Governor ordered 1) a stop to purchases of goods and services ‚Äì except for materials required in the classrooms, 2) limits on travel, 3) a hold on pay-as-you-go appropriations for capital improvements, and 4) a freeze on hiring for vacant positions.

Click here to see details about the cuts.

As State Budget Director it is my job to assist Governor Perdue in creating a state budget that meets its constitutional obligation.†† It‚Äôll take making tough decisions ‚Äì which we have already begun ‚Äì but we will balance the state budget.


Charlie Perusse
State Budget Director

Dear Governor Perdue:
†††† The citizens of north Carolina appreciate your conscientious efforts to balance the state budget.†
†††† I hope you will keep in mind that there are two ways of balancing the budget: reducing expenditures, and increasing revenue.† I'd like to suggest that only a small percentage of the population is feeling pinched by hard economic times, and the rest of us† (I include my wife and me -- we are a long way from wealthy, but we aren't hurting) can afford to pay more to maintain our state as the kind of society we want to live in.†
†††† There are ways of increasing taxes on those who can afford it while sparing those who are unemployed or otherwise in difficulty.

When legislators say, "We can't afford to do this," let's remind them that there are times when they should say, "We can't afford not to do this."† Scrimping on children, health, education and safety will cost us later.† It's cheaper to take care of children now than to build more prisons later.

Thank you so very much.† Our state needs a tremendous amount of help.

Gov. Perdue's idea of raising taxes is counterproductive.† Our homes have lost their values.† Many people owe more than the house is worth.† Our state does not know when to stop spending and building structures which total millions of square footage with no possible way of selling or renting them.† Some of our officials live in a "dream world" and do not have any idea of reality.

Just yesterday I read† the real estate section of the Atlanta Business Chronicle. What an overwhelming wake up call!† We are now second to Detroit in job losses.† Our officials are totally unrealistic in their "Pollyanna" type comments.† We are in a crisis and it's getting worse every day. Read this week's Atlanta Business Chronicle.

Everything in this state appears to be political† It is time that the leaders of Georgia put on their big boy and girl clothes, swallow an overdose of open-mindedness and honesty and perform the duties that they were elected and appointed to do. Your help is needed.

Respectfully submitting my opinions and hoping that others do the same.

Charlie:

Yours is not an envious job.† I would like you to deliver a message to Senator Basnight.

We all realize these are perilous times and solutions are fraught with downsides and unintended consequences.† We also know that conventional wisdom has it that tax hikes are anathema in the current scenario.† Given that, I, for one, am getting sick and tired of the legislature, mostly its leaders, trying to take actions targeted at particular groups.† We've been playing this "sin" taxes game for awhile now and I understand there is not too much a political price to be paid for going after these "sinners" but we are all in this together, "sinners" and non-sinners alike.†

If we are a state and a community of people let's share the burden.† And that doesn't mean the other cheap out of raising the sales tax.† We have a income tax that, in theory, is tailor made for minor adjustments up and down to offset economic conditions.† Now I know that some, probably rightfully, consider an income tax increase, at any time, political suicide but to President Obama's point, all of us, most especially our leaders, need to grow up, and take those actions which are necessary and fair.† They need to quit hiding behind those actions that are politically†expedient and will likely lead to their holding onto power.

We elect leaders to lead us.† We don't elect them to win popularity contests, nor do we elect them†so they can†set about working for their re-election.† We were founded by a group of men who†placed, not only their reputations, their property, their families, but their very lives, on the line for what they felt was necessary.† A little of our founding backbone would seem in order.

Good luck with your task.† You'll need it.†

Charlie: Hawaii like NC also feeling budget crunch too
and hopefully things will get better as 2009 moves
along further in the year. Belt tightening never
pleasant like Hawaii workers being asked to furlough
themselves without pay for couple of days each month.
I wonder if this means later working less hours and
sharing working remaining hours of each month. I
wonder if this means lowering the speed limit from 70
mph to 60 mph on the Interstate? Aloha, Frankie &

When as a candadate I emailed Gov. Bev. Purdue three (3) times weeks†prior to the election. I did this because she asked for interestred/concerned people AND business people to email her. She posed as genuinely interested and wanted to hear from North Carolina citizens.

I NEVER HEARD A WORD BACK....which therefore I have much less respect for her.

By virtue of me getting this email and two prior to this, I can assume she or someone got the emails I sent however, I reasonably assume she just like most polititians could give a rats behind.

	Gov. Perdue :† I live off Pool road† and we never got our road sprayed with ice on it I almost went into the ditch trying to go to work because of black ice on a black pavement which I find NOT safe for driving in the snow and rain. Lots of wrecks on them. We have an S shaped road at the bottom of a hill on Pool road.† It was very icy. Also when their is emergency Vehicles it is very hard to pull over on a road of two lanes and no where to pull off the road, except in the ditch. I find the black roads very UN SAFE for our lives. They maybe cheaper but it puts all of lives at RISK when bad weather comes. I have seen many bad wrecks on Pool road because of the black roads.†† On Friday morning the roads still had black ice on them especially the one by my† house.† Please try to widen Pool road out towards Knightdale because it is growing with many new developments and the roads are bumper to bumper. They keep buidling houses and no roads for the drivers to travel. We have a new Development coming up soon with the S shaped road that is waiting for wrecks to happen.

Mr. Perusse,

I noticed that the DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION†has†decided†how†the state will use money from the federal stimulus allocation to NC, meant for stimulating the economy through expansion of building of roads and bridges. He is quoted in the news media as saying that this money will be used to offset the existing shortfall in planned state road and bridge building for the next three years. Why not cover that shortfall by increasing state taxes on gasoline which will also encourage a move toward more efficient cars.†Although none of us are anxious to pay more taxes, now is an excellent time to enact such taxes.†I hope you will encourage the governor to consider such a move. Thank you for you consideration.

Charles Monroe†

I would like to urge Gov. Perdue and her office to look into the monetary reform movement. They have some VERY exciting ideas about how we could totally eliminate our current budget constraints with INTEREST FREE loans from the Federal Government through a new system of government controlled credit and banking. The current PRIVATE system has obviously failed and will continue to do so as long as the only way out of our economic mess is to BORROW more money. Check out www. monetary.org and† <http://www.webofdebt.com>www.webofdebt.com for a better idea!!

Dear Mr. Parusse,

I salute you for your assistance to Governor Perdue to attain a balanced budget in a responsible way.† I have been proud of every executive order, every decision, every communique (in any form) that has been issued by the first female governor of North Carolina.† It is obvious that she has "paid her dues," paid rapt attention to detail in the many posts in which she has served, and knows what she is doing!† Sincerely, Gloria Lawrence

Dear Madam Governor:
Illegal immigrants cost our state billions each year.† Perhaps your office could implement some penalties and punishment for employers hiring them and to landlords who rent to them.
Requiring other citizens to provide health insurance to others children is wrong.† No one insured mine.† I made the sacrifice to take responsibilty for the child I produced.† Give away programs enable adults to continue their irresponsible reproduction.
I†feel certain that no one in our government cares about our state or our country, but some of its citizens still care.
Action on the above issues would go far in balancing our budget.
Glenda W Price

If everybody in this country paid some attention to what our fantastic
Governor is doing we'd survive our present and GROWING national
catastrophe with flying colors! I doubt he'd pay any attention, but I
wish Beverly would share her know-how with Obama! I hope every North
Carolinian is aware of the fact that we have the best governor in the
country!

One way to save $2million would be to stop the outdoor firing range planned for the Western JUSTICE acad.† This range willl be very bad for the small community of Edneyville, the noise will tear up all of the families and stop all of the growth in the area.† An indoor firing range would be welcome or none would be fine.† As one member of the family who donated the land for the acad. and as a close land owner I ask you to stop this range and save $2milliom for the state.†

Balalncing state budgets is fine except in times of deep recession or depression.† Then, as any one with a knowledge of economic knows, it makes things worse, and all the business cuts, govt cuts, etc. make things still worse, with lower revenues, requiring more cuts, making things still worse.† I understand we have a constitutional requirement.† It needs an override provision for depressions.

	I sincerely think you need to outlaw driving and chatting or texting on cell phones... terrible problem

Many volunteers are performing needed tasks in many agencies.† Now that there is a freeze in hiring, more are needed.. however, taxing me on the miles I drive to fill a need and raising taxes as a whole is not a good idea...†
you would find more would volunteer if there was some 'reward'.. though that is not the purpose of volunteering... but being taxed on my mileage is a slap in the head...

Office of the Governor,

I know the NC State Education Lottery funds are earmarked for education but I wonder if an amendment can't be enacted whereby at the request of the governor and monitored by the legislature the funds can't be reallocated to fill the gap in shortfall until such time as the economy is stable.† Our former governor blithely moved funds from mental health to education and who knows what else he juggled.† I believe that if it's public and above-board the people of NC would support just such a move.

Thanks, Jean B.

	Senator Basnight wants more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Just what the low income, laid off don't need. I don't drink so don't care but here in Brunswick the unemployment is horrific. State gov. should take the same hit as the rest of the working world. Lay some people off, starting with the DMV Building As far as deficits I bet I could help close the gap. Been around long enough. Any state employee that thinks he or she should get a pay increase should go into private business for 12 months, then they'd jump back to the stae for 10% less. We all have to sacrifice not the rich, not the poor, not private business, not gov. employees, but all of the above. I'm pulling for you Bev. but tell Sen. Basnight to stay in Manteo with his ludicrous tax proposals. Oh by the way I still smoke but not much, however I do go to SC from Shallotte to buy gas and cigarettes. Wonder why.

Dear State Budgeet Director,

I fear that the State of North Carolina is making the same mistake with far-reaching repercussions with regards to the hiring freeze as the banking industry and auto industry nationwide are doing with their massive layoffs.† I realize that you can't hire people if you can't pay them.† That said, thousands of people have lost their jobs.† It was my understanding that we were going to create new jobs, not decrease the number of existing ones.

The less people employed, the less people we have who can purchase goods and services and pay taxes.† This starts a vicious cycle of ever-increasing poverty with no end in sight.

Please consider this and find ways to generate income for the state while creating more jobs.

Very truly yours,

Janice E. Sears

<http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/i_safe.gif>The global economic downturn, credit crunch and overall volatility in the financial markets have had a significant impact on our state budget.† The Office of State Budget and Management expects a budget shortfall of between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion.

I read in our local newspaper what Ms. Perdue has done
with DPI.  If she needs to pay off a political debt to
a friend, please do not do it at the expense of our
children.  How does any elected official suddently
decide to replace another(even if temporarily) with
one of her "friends".  If she wants Bill Harrison to
have a job functioning as State Superintendent, let
her have him campaign for it as Dr.Atkinson campaigned
and won may I add overwhelmingly.  I voted, supported,
and campaigned for Ms. Purdue and for Dr. Atkinson.  I
have known Beverly a long time.  If she has some
rational explanation for what she has done, I need to
know it.  She knows how I feel about supporting
females in leadership roles.  When many of my friends,
colleagues, neighbors, and "blood" family told me not
to support Beverly Purdue, I did so deligently.  Tell
me what is going on with Beverly and DPI.  Send me an
email because I know I will never hear from her now
that she is in office.  By the way, I am glad she
choose red for her inagural gown.  She knows that red
is a POWER color.  I wait to hear from Ms. Purdue
about this situation.
