On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

It would have been nice and very much appreciated if you had taken the time to visit the NC Missions of Mercy free dental clinic at Garber United Methodist Church very near your home in New Bern, as I had requested several months in advance.  I have repeatedly requested a visit by you to one or more of our clinics and have been promised such by your aides.  After fundraisers, however, any such requests seem to be ignored.  Is healthcare for the needy not a priority?

How about as part of raising the standard, you keep Dix open?
It should never have been closed, and I'll be happy to enumerate why in a face-to-face meeting.

Thanks for your email. My mother was a resident of Asheboro until 1998 when she had a terrible incident at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro. Mom is bipolar and at the time she was 82 years old. The nurses tied her to a bed and would not let her go. Fortunately, we were able to get help for her in the Northeast. I am happy to say that Mom is now 92 and doing very well.

No one, no matter how mentally sick they are, needs to be treated like an animal.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am a successful English and communication instructor at Montgomery Community College, where I have taught since 1995. My wife, Jane (nee Jane Hartley), is a Commissioner in New London and was formerly a member of the Albemarle City Council. Health care, especially for aging baby boomers, is an issue that should be a number one priority for your administration.

Sincerely,

Adrian Van Sinderen

I want to recommend to Governor Perdue that you may not want to post your signature in an image that can be easily copied and used in documents and email that can be forged and presented using your name, as is the case with this email.  This may seem over the top but I don’t believe you can be too careful.  If you have any questions about my recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.



I am happy to hear about the On-Site Accountability initiative. 



Best Regards,

Margaret Randol

On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

Dear Governor Perdue,

As a clinical psychologist, and active Democrat, and a human being, I strongy support your efforts and your dedication to resolving the issues facing the mentally ill in North Carolina.  I am confident that you understand that these issues go far beyond the severe difficulties faced in our state psychiatric institutions.  Local outpatient srevices are limited and inconsistent.  Attrition rates among publicly funded mental health clinicans are high; those most needing opportunities to trust must start over and over as they are moved from clinician to clinician.   Experienced clinicians, who are desperately needed to work with the severely and persistently mentally ill, cannot afford to work at current rates.  Those of us who work in facilities serving the traditionally underserved are understaffed, and our referral options are sadly limited.  Even clinicians in private practice are struggling to pay bills as patients opt to limit their own care because they cannot afford regular sessions, and as those in treatment lose jobs and insurance.  Meanwhile, the stigm associated with seeking mental health services remains in place, even thought mental illness impacts a large proportion of our families and is a major factor in limiting the productivity of our work force.

Please continue to let is know how we can help.

Sincerely,

Ronni Margolin ,PhD

Good for you. It is about time!  The Cherry staff were supposedly to attend a behavioral intervention plan training/in-service that I provided (i.e., it would have made no difference to me, financially, had they attended - it was an AHEC event) in the Spring: no one from Cherry attended. To me, that was disappointing. The values among providers tend to become skewed, and it happens in academe, also. People become very caught up in ego-protection and power versus helping and needs of the people for whom we care. I have been very disenchanted with this lately, myself, and am seeking to potentially relocate to D.C. ...Maybe you can help bring about the needed change, though. I hope, for this state - regardless of where I end up - that you are successful in your mission. Best wishes for success and resiliency!

On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND LEADERS WILL NOT PERFORM WELL IF THEY ARE NOT GIVEN OWNERSHIP OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  MOST JUST SEE IT AS A JOB RATHER THAN AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT MAKES NORTH CAROLINA WORK BETTER.  LEADERSHIP BY EXAMPLE, ENCOURAGEMENT WITH SINCERITY, FOLLOWUP AND CONCERN WILL NOT ONLY MAKE YOUR GOVERNORSHIP A GREAT ONE BUT IT WILL BECOME THE MODEL WITH WHICH ALL OTHERS WILL MEASURE THEMSELVES BY.....KEEP GOING GOV. BEV,  WE ARE BEHIND YOU.

You are truly, truly remarkable! SO many make grandiose "promises"
during their campaign stint and don't even REMEMBER them once they're in
office -- let alone KEEP them. Your report came at a very needed time!
YOU break the boundaries!!! THANK YOU! You make me so proud to be a born
and bred North Carolinian

Nellie Anderson.

Thank you for your commitment to Mental Health.  We all know the system is very broken. 

Our mentally ill daughter has managed to stay out of Cherry hospital,thank goodness, but the community support she is getting through a private provider is minimal.  Ultimately, I hope the state will take back the management of our mental health system.  When it was turned it over to private for profit businesses, I don't how we can expect anything else except for them to make a profit at the client's expense.  They would not be in the business if they could not make a profit.  Our daughter had much better care at the local mental health center in her county before the privatization came about.

On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

I am delighted with the Governor’s start in office.  I was heartened, too, to hear her say that “business as usual” is over.  She will try to take politics out of road building which should mean that Mecklenburg’s belt road would get priority over Fayetteville’!

Thanks.

How refreshing it is to receive such messages! Getting out there and seeing for yourself is long overdue for all elective offices. I hope this will rub off on the legislators. Kudos to you, Ms. Perdue!

Glad we are raising the bar, but this report is vague. What did you find at Cherry Hospital? What did the patients/staff have to say?

Thanks,

On-Site Accountability



Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

Hallelujahl!!!  This action is so long overdue.  In addition, the local situation that has been dumped on our regional health center emergency room must be addressed.  The current situation is unfair to all our residents, those with mental health emergences and those with physical emergences.

Many thanks,

Nancy S.  Marks

I was just informed today about a Metal of Honor metal that was approved before 1920 that was never given to the recipient.  The person who found the metal in some archive in DC has chased down the next of kin of the recipient and found a sister, aged about 90, who lives near Raleigh.  I thought perhaps the Governor would like to make this presentation, and perhaps involved Gen. Shelton, a North Carolina resident, who was Joint Chief of Staffs during the Clinton administration.



Please run this by her and let me know what she would like to do.



By the way, the metal will be awarded—the question is—would our Governor like to make the presentation?

This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.

Dear Governor Perdue:



Again, what a refreshing change. In contrast to complete hands off approach, you are making responsible people accountable.. Not only that, you are striving to improve openness, quality and efficiencies in all areas of the state government and agencies. I hope you demand and receive ethical conduct as well from all involved, including legislatures. We wish you many success during your term.



Sincerely,

Vic Gondha

Friends,



Friday I made an unannounced visit to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro.  I made a pledge to the citizens of this state upon taking office that I would make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies a priority during my administration. This is just one way of fulfilling my promise of being a hands-on governor, and this visit is the first of many.



Cherry Hospital, as you know, has been a high-profile example of what's been wrong with our state's mental health system.  During the 90 minutes I spent at Cherry, I met with hospital leaders, caregivers and patients.  I asked them straightforward questions and I got honest answers. I let them know that I've raised the bar.



Secretary of Health and Human Services Lanier Cansler joined me on my visit, where he told hospital leaders that "we will have zero tolerance for patient abuse or mistreatment."  He also pledged to visit all of North Carolina's mental health facilities in the coming months, a move I support and encourage. In fact, I hope all of my new cabinet secretaries will take this hands-on approach and become a familiar sight to those working within their agencies.



My vision is for North Carolina's mental health system to be the gold standard for the nation.  I want you to know that we've begun that process, and we won’t stop until we get it right – for our patients, for our patients’ families, and for all North Carolina citizens.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you so much for taking these steps.  It would be great if similar efforts could be made in the assisted-living, nursing home arena.  My brother was Down’s Syndrome and lived in several mental institutions and retirement facilities over the course of his life.  The lack of care in some of those was deplorable. If they could be operated with a similar “zero tolerance” for negligence, mistreatment and abuse, wouldn’t we all have less dread of putting our loved ones in their care?

Thanks for all you are attempting to do – it’s a difficult task you’ve taken on.

Sincerely,

Lee Davis

Governor Beverly Eads Purdue,



Congratulations! I am encouraged and uplifted by the diligent effort and steady strides you are making during your short tenure as Governor of our great state. I am thoroughly impressed with what I see thus far.  I realize now, that you truly are working for the people of this great state of North Carolina.  More importantly, as I continue to read your emails, which affords transparency to the citizens, it is clear that you are deliberate in your plans to improve the state of affairs for the disenfranchised and marginalized.  If ever, you want to have a grass roots conversation about what is “happening” in our community, please call on me….



Congratulations and Much success,
