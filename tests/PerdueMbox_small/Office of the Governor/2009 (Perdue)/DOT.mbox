Hi,

There problem in this situation is with enforcement, and the NCDOT doesn't have any authority in that area. We think the Highway Patrol is the right choice to handle a response.

Visitor: Mr. John Claggett

Address: 108 Jaye Lane, Providence, NC 27315

Email: johnclaggett@comcast.net

Subject: Traffic Law Enforcement

Comment: In the spring of 2007 the sheriff of Caswell County requested through the Board of Commissioners that NCDOT conduct a traffic study due to ongoing safety issues on SR 1503 (Walters Mill Rd). NCDOT conducted the study and deemed signage was necessary. The signs were placed and now even after all this time there isn't any enforcement by either the State Hwy Patrol or the local Sheriff's Dept. The State Hwy Patrol says they can't enforce the signs that NCDOT deemed necessary and the local law enforcement says it's a state maintained road and they don't have the manpower. Who can I contact to rectify this convoluted process? I can't get my state representative to return my calls (Bill Faison). Mr. Mike Mills of the NCDOT as well as Sargeant Pearson of the SHP is aware of this particular area in Caswell County.

Dear Mr. Fox:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. I checked with the NCDOT Alexander County maintenance office for the background on Jake Reese Court.

The paving project went on the list for paving priority sometime in 2001, with several projects above it in priority. Right of Way (R/W) research began in early 2004 only to have a conflict with an out of state property owner. This person did not want to sign the proposed R/W agreement, which was required to go through with the paving, and attempts to contact this person to negotiate an agreement were unsuccessful. The budget crunch in 2005-06 put a lot of secondary construction programs on hold, adding to the delay. In the meantime, efforts to negotiate a R/W agreement with the out of state property owner continued to be held up as we went in to 2007 without a response to any method of contact. Finally the remaining property owners agreed to fund the Secondary Roads Condemnation process, and in mid-2008, the NCDOT district office in Statesville began the initial surveys. Once completed, the R/W department in Shelby sent a letter to the out of state property owner to explain the upcoming condemnation procedure, and only then did she contact the NCDOT district engineer that oversees Alexander County. This person has since signed the R/W agreement and it was recorded on Oct. 28, 2008. Now that all R/W agreements have been signed, we are at the mercy of the current budget situation. Once it improves and money is available for the project, Jake Reese Court is number one on the list to be graded and paved. If you need additional information, please contact NCDOT Alexander County Maintenance Engineer Cole G. Gurley at (828-632-2164).

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Dear Ms. Hopkins:

Your email to the Governor's web site was forwarded to me for response. The NCDOT has no authority or say regarding possible additional fees or taxes such as the mileage tax you refer to in your letter. The decision whether to impose any taxes or fees to raise transportation funds is up the General Assembly to consider when it convenes late this month. We are recommending that interested citizens like yourself contact their state representative and state senator to let them know about their concerns regarding the transportation funding suggestions that have been presented to the legislature.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

I am writing because I am very concerned about DOT news.  There is talk of imposing additional taxes, including a tax on the miles each vehicle is driven.  I don't understand.  North Carolina has one of the highest gas taxes in the nation.  If this is not enough, there must be gross mismanagement.



I also fear such additional taxes would greatly stifle growth in our state.  I know I would not move to a state with a mileage tax.  In fact, even though I am a North Carolina native who has always lived here, I would strongly consider moving in that case.   A recession is not the time to raise taxes on basic goods.

Janice Hopkins

Dear Mr. Guy:

Your email to the Governor's office regarding Potts Creek Road was referred to me for response. Your information is correct in that Potts Creek is not on the state-maintained road list, and per state law, the NC Department of Transportation is not allowed to do any maintenance or upgrades on that road, as it is considered private property. It is a situation that neither the NCDOT nor Governor Perdue have the power to change. That can only be done by the General Assembly, which convenes next week in Raleigh. In that regard, we recommend you contact your state representative and state senator about the situation, as only a change in state law would allow state money to be spent on the road.

Someone in the Davidson County maintenance office recalled being contacted a couple years ago about adding Potts Creek to the state-maintained list. They said they never heard about it again after referring the caller to the District maintenance office in Salisbury. Since you refer to a General Statute about the situation, it appears you may have looked into it already. However, just in case, I can send you the list of qualifications needed before the Board of Transportation would consider an application for state status. If after going over that list, you believe your road would qualify or you have any questions, you should contact the NCDOT District office at (704) 639-7560. Please let me know if you would like a copy of the list.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Dear Mr. Grierson:



I have been asked by the Governor’s Office to respond.  Thank you for writing and sharing your concern about roadside litter.



North Carolina does a have a litter problem.  During the winter months, litter becomes more prevalent due to the weather and the ability for litter removal crews to get out.  It is the responsibility of the N.C. Department of Transportation to maintain the 79,000 miles of roadways in our state, and this includes litter removal.



The NCDOT has an ongoing agreement with the N.C. Department of Correction to utilize inmate squads for statewide roadside litter removal.  Each year the NCDOT spends more than $16 million to remove more than 10 million pounds of roadside litter.



The NCDOT also works with non profit organizations as N.C. Keep America Beautiful and N.C. Big Sweep.  Their volunteers participate in litter cleanups and remove up to another million pounds of litter annually.



In addition to the NCDOT Adopt-A-Highway groups and other volunteers, those in the Community Service Work Program also participate in litter removal during the NCDOT Litter Sweep – the department’s biannual statewide roadside litter cleanup.  Litter Sweep is held the last two weeks of April and September.  All citizens can participate.



The state’s Litter Law (G.S. 14-399) has fines from $250 up to $2,000, a point on the driver license and community service for those convicted.  Annually there are more than 5,500 litter and unsecured load citations issued.



Mr. Grierson, I invite you to visit the NCDOT Office of Beautification Programs Web site to learn more about the various litter prevention initiatives at <http://www.ncdot.org/doh/operations/dp_chief_eng/roadside/Beautification/> www.ncdot.org/~/Beautification.  Once at this location you will find many links, i.e. Litter Law, Adopt-A-Highway and Swat-A-Litterbug programs, Litter Sweep, school curriculums within Litter Prevention, and the state’s litter report within “News.”



In closing, I want to provide you the phone number of the local NCDOT  Guilford County maintenance office where you can report the heavily littered sites or roadway hazards.  The person answering the phone will take your information and then take the appropriate action.  The phone number is 336-668-2424.



Thank you again for writing.  We know there is more to do.  I hope the information I’ve provided is helpful.



Sincerely,



George Kapetanakis

Dear Pastor Ash:

Your email to the Governor's web site was referred to me for response. I recommend that you put together a list of the specific road or street names you would like to see improved. Then you should contact the NCDOT Richmond County maintenance office in Rockingham at (910) 997-9164. The staff there can check the names on your list to see if any are state roads, and if so, they may be able to tell you when they are scheduled for maintenance or paving.

Please be aware that under state law, the NCDOT can only do repairs and upgrades to roads within the state road system. There are a number of roads, particularly in rural areas, that are considered private roads, and therefore we can't work on them. The upkeep of those roads is considered the legal responsibility of the road owner or owners, or in some cases the residents who live on the road.

There is a process to apply to have a road added to the state-maintained system. A list of qualifications must be met before the Board of Transportation would consider the application, and staff at the Richmond County office, or in the NCDOT District 3 maintenance office, also in Rockingham, can explain the process for adding a road to the state system. The District 3 office can be reached at (910) 582-7075.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

"Speak Out" is an expression of opinion from the Editorial Board of WBTV, and is presented by General Manager, Nick Simonette.

I-485, better known as the outer belt, is still a few notches short of being buckled...and it looks like it may stay that way for quite a while.

61 miles are open to traffic... leaving just 6 miles left.

But that last leg isn't scheduled to be completed until the year 20-18... NINE Years from now! 

Our area consistently grows and develops... so why, we ask... "why is I-485 taking so long to complete?" 

The answer is quite likely some "good ol' boy" politics.

Follow me here.

Fayetteville Mayor Tony Chavonne, and state senate majority leader Tony Rand -- also from Fayetteville -- recently pushed to keep construction of their I-295 loop a top priority with the State DOT at the expense of finishing I-485 in Charlotte.  

I-485 carries 120-thousand vehicles each day, while the partially-completed outer belt in Fayetteville is only used by 9-thousand cars.

Finishing the Fayetteville loop before our loop can only be justified with very fuzzy math.

So upsetting is this to Matthews Mayor Lee Myers, he wrote President Obama asking him to investigate North Carolina's use of federal road money. 

A bold move... but we applaud the Mayor's effort to shine light.

Far too many times, politics in this state trumps need... this appears to be one of those cases.

If you agree I-485 should be finished before Fayetteville's road, speak out by contacting your representative.    

Because WBTV is "On Your Side," we encourage everyone to "Speak Out" - tell us what YOU think. <mailto:SpeakOut@wbtv.com>SpeakOut@wbtv.com.

Dear Ms. Harwood:

Your email to the Governor's office was forwarded to me for response. The NCDOT follows national guidelines in determining when a traffic signal, which while reducing certain types of collisions, also increases others, is needed.

According to the NCDOT Division 10 traffic engineers office, which covers Stanly County, a traffic count study is currently under way, in coordination with the City of Locust, to see if a signal is needed at the intersection you mention in your email.

Concerning the superstreet intersection on NC 24/27 at the Super Wal Mart, it will be signalized. Studies and research show the innovative superstreet designs result in fewer crashes and less traffic delays than conventional intersections.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Email: p6781@bellsouth.net

Subject: STOP LIGHT IN LOCUST NC

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, The dot is causing a problem in Locust, They had said that they would put up a stop light at the intersection of west main and brownhill road. Now they say they won't and won't do a study to see if its needed. We are a small town and starting to grow. BoJangles was all set to build and bring in jobs. Now they won't build if there is not going to be a stop light. I ask you what can be done. The  DOT already messed up and refused a stop light at the New Walmart going up and as we speak putting in a super street intersection that will ultimately cause a major accident problem. I personally think this is all poor planning on the  DOT's part. I would ask what can be done so that our momentum for growth and jobs is not lost. Thank you for your time. Sincerely Pam Harwood Concerned Citizen

Dear Mr. Shinn:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response.

Regarding Mt. Pleasant Road, according to the Catawba County NCDOT maintenance office, when checking the road last summer it was noticed the surface had become cracked in several locations. It was decided to put a light skin patch in those areas to seal the road over the winter, and they seem to be serving the purpose intended. They were not expected to be a permanent solution and admittedly are a little rough in some places, but the purpose was to keep the road intact until a more permanent solution can be made. That solution was expected this year, as Mt. Pleasant Road was scheduled to be added to the resurfacing list or included  in the Asphalt Surface Treatment (AST) program under pavement preservation. However, because of the the current troubled budget situation for state government and the NCDOT in particular, both the the resurfacing and AST programs have been put on hold. In the meantime, the NCDOT Traffic Services unit has been contacted and asked to get the paint striping reinstalled.

In the case of US 70 in Statesville, that project was initially scheduled for completion on July 1, 2007. A revised completion date as a result of agreements for additional or extra work, plus delays which were beyond the contractor's control and utility delays was April 26, 2008. However, the actual completion date was December 3, 2008, more than seven months later. As a result, the Department has assessed $661,286.77 in liquidated damages concerning that project. We're not sure what stretch of road you are referring to that was not striped or signed, as the Department ensures that any roadway is constructed per plans and meets specifications including striping and signing before it is opened up to the travelling public.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Comment: I am disgusted every time I drive down Mt Pleasant rd in Denver NC. I saw the State repaving that surface, even though it didn’t need it, and the end result was a surface that is 10 times worse than what we had before. I am appalled that the persons responsible for the quality of workmanship on that project let that be counted as completed; frankly there are dirt roads in NC that are in better shape. I also would like to comment on the hwy 70 project in Statesville, I want to know why the contractor was allowed to go 14 mo overdue without one single fine and they were allowed to open a stretch of road before it was stripped, signed, or lined and without notifying the public that it was opening prior to the same. That little oversight I believe was directly responsible for TWO people’s deaths. Now the reason I bring all this up is because of the static I hear about needing more money for road projects: Well tell me why I should give you more money to spend when this is just two examples of how you are managing the money you already have?

Subject: Concerns on SR 1300 (BH.Duncan Road) , Ashe / Watauga Counties

Mr. Johnson -

Your recent contact thru Contact Us regarding the maintenance condition of subject unpaved route has been forwarded to the North Wilkesboro DOT District office,  given our involvement with roadway maintenance activities in Ashe and Wilkes Counties. We are also in receipt of your recent e-mail / letter, as sent to Governor Perdue's office regarding this same route.

As you are likely aware , the initial 0.30 mile length of this unpaved route is in Ashe County,  with the remaining 0.90 mile length being located within Watauga County.
The entire length of SR 1300 was inspected by our Ashe County DOT staff yesterday, following an earlier citizen contact received on Monday. It was confirmed that additional stone was needed which should address many of the concerns you have described. It had been estimated that around 10 truck loads (approx.150 tons) would be needed at this time. The placement of roadway stone stabilization was completed as of Friday,  January 31st and should have addressed noted concerns.

Although our Department has experienced some budget limitations as a result of the continuing economic situation, we will continue to address any roadway maintenance needs to the extent possible. My apologies for any difficulty that you and others may have encountered during recent days on this route. Unfortunately these conditions are often experienced, to a greater extent following the freezing and thawing effect that occurs during the winter months in our mountain counties.

It is hoped that these comments will address your concerns at this time ; please let me know if I can be of any assistance in the future.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing this letter to your office to describe to you the abhorrent road conditions that exist on B. H. Duncan Road in Ashe and Watuaga  Counties.  I own a home at 113 Vixen Den Drive in Zionville.  I must use B. H. Duncan Road to access the subdivision where my home is located.  This past weekend the conditions were terrible.  The road was nothing more than a mud hole in many areas.  There is erosion along the ditch areas and there was at least 4-5 inches of sloppy mud on the surface.  No gravel exists.  This road services over 30 households now as the subdivision where my home is and has other homes under construction.  This construction also means that large trucks are coming and going delivering materials that  degrades the condition of the road.
A resolution must be made to this problem.  Other members in the community have complained to the highway department and other agencies over the last 2 years and still we have seen no real fix.  Surely such "third world conditions" should not be allowed to exist.  I grew up on a farm.  I am quite accustomed to gravel and dirt roads, but the problem on B. H. Duncan is far beyond any farm roads.
I look forward to your reply and the reply of other State officials.

Sincerely,
Stephen M. Johnson

Dear Mr. Horney:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. As of right now, the projected start for construction of the final five-mile section of the I-485 loop remains 2015, because of major budget shortfalls faced by the N.C. Department of Transportation. Simply put, there isn't any money to do the work earlier unless new funding sources are found. To date, the Charlotte area has received nearly $1 billion in designated urban loop funding to construct the I-485 loop. That is more than any other city has received, but admittedly more is needed. Loop projects in Winston-Salem and Greensboro have also been delayed, and there is no funding planned for additional loop projects in Raleigh.

That is where the Economic Stimulus package request could come in. The NCDOT has requested $122.6 million dollars in federal funds as part of that request specifically for completing that final leg of I-485. While it is questionable whether we would receive that full amount, if a significant portion of the request would be granted, then it is possible that the start of the final leg of the Charlotte loop project could be moved up considerably in terms of a timeline. If Congress approves the stimulus package, once President Obama signs that bill, then a construction contract could be signed within four months. That could mean construction would move up as many as five years, with work starting in 2010 or 2011. The state would still need to come up with additional funding to complete the project, but it would be a start.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

There is only a 5 mile stretch left to be completed that will connect I-77 to I-85 at the north end. They say it will be 10 years before they even BEGIN construction on the final leg. We need the road now. You promised in the camapign that you would address this issue as one of your first tasks. Please, please, anything you can do will be greatly appreciated. We cannot wait over a decade to have Charlotte's Outerbelt completed. Thank you, Joey Horney

Subject: P&N reactivation

Comment: GOvernor Perdue, Congratulations on your win. The reason that I writing to you is because I live in the area of the reactivation of the old P&N train tracks. I have lived in Mt.Holly, N.C my entire life and I'm 38 years old, my husband and I wanted to build a nice house in a nice neighbor hood so that my son would grow up in a low crime area. MR. Gray is wanting to reactivate the tracks. The first reason not to do it is for the safety of all the little children in this neighbor hood, the tracks are within 50 feet of some of the houses and the possiblity of an over turned train it could take out over half of this neighbor hood. The second reason not to approve this is because it is going to cost 5.5 million dollars to resurface the tracks and with the economy I do not think that 5 million dollars should be wasted on tracks that has not been in use since 1991.Years ago it was used for the use of mills, but as everyone knows there aren't any mills left in Mt.Holly but two. I don't think that you would want to waste that much money on something that is not going to be that profittable. Thank you so much for your time. Wendy Mccall

Subject: P&N Railroad

Comment: The money allocated for the railroad would be much better spent on the local businesses such a Frieghtliner. With fuel costs reduced the savings to the businesses along the line would not be sufficient to contract with the railroad. The loss in property values and the failure to complete planned homeowner communities would have more of a negative impact on the local economy than any benefit derived from the rail reopening. The rail company has not given a complete prospectus detailing the signed customers and the planned income as compared to the cost to refurbish and maintain the line. With the reduced state budget and lack of jobs the money can be better allocated to proven projects. Thank you, Paul R. Convertino

Subject: P&N Railroad Activation in Mt. Holly, NC

Comment: I am writing as a resident of Mount Holly, a homeowner in Mount Holly as well as a long-time manufacturing executive. I do not believe that re-activating the rail corridor in Mount  Holly is in the best interests of the city. Additional railroad traffic will diminish the quality of life in Mount Holly as well as hurt property values and, ultimately, the tax base in Mount  Holly. There is clear evidence that the population migration from Charlotte is going west toward the Mount Holly direction. With additional rail traffic people will choose one of the many more peaceful alternatives. As a manufacturing executive with thirty years of industrial experience I can tell you that in my professional opinion, the railroad will not add economic benefit to the City. I have done manufacturing plant site selection for Fortune 50 companies (GE and Westinghouse). I have built two new manufacturing plants and closed other plants that were no longer competitive. Railroad availability was never a factor in any of this activity. The days of bulk purchasing and shipping of parts/materials/supplies are over. All manufacturing based businesses, including distribution, must be globally competitive. As a result, Just-In-Time and Lean Enterprise principles now dictate buying and selling activity. The move is to smaller order quantities and faster turns, not bulk shipments of anything.

Dear Mr. Keehner:

Your email to the Governor's office was forwarded to me for response. Under state law, when North Carolina agencies such as the Department of Transportation put something out to bid such as heavy equipment, highway projects or any other item or service, there can't be any restrictions regarding where the bidding companies are
located or where the equipment is manufactured, as long as they have . We legally must accept the lowest bid, as long as the equipment or service being rendered meets pre-set contract standards. It would take action by the General Assembly to change that law, as neither the Governor, the NCDOT or any state agency have the authority to restrict who gets to bid on a state contract. We recommend you contact your state representative and/or state senator regarding your concerns.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Dear Ms. Stevens:



Your correspondence was forwarded to me to respond.  Thank you for writing.  I appreciate your taking the time to share your concerns about roadside littering.



North Carolina does have a litter problem.  The NCDOT has spent millions of dollars in litter removal during the past several years.  From 2005 through 2007 more than $16 million each year was spent to remove more than 10 million pounds each year. 



The NCDOT has a biannual litter cleanup called Litter Sweep where its employees, Adopt-A-Highway groups, NC DOC inmate squads, those in Community Service Work and other citizen volunteers will pick up roadside litter.  Litter Sweep is normally held the last two weeks of April and September.  The cleanup will usually remove more than two million pounds of roadside litter during each Litter Sweep.



When it comes to the State of North Carolina litter law, it has fines from $250 up to $2,000 and can be doubled with subsequent convictions.  A point on the driver license and community service work can also be part of the penalty.  Citations for littering can include intentional and unintentional littering as well as for unsecured loads.  Court costs are added to the fine.



The NCDOT also works with nonprofit statewide organizations as NC Big Sweep and NC Keep America Beautiful.  Both organizations promote litter prevention in the schools/communities and have tens of thousands of volunteers that remove litter from watersheds and roadsides.



I invite you to visit the NCDOT Office of Beautification Programs Web site at <http://www.ncdot.gov/~beautification>www.ncdot.gov/~beautification where you will find links to the information I’ve mention in this note and much more.  Also within this site, you can find a list of the NCDOT county maintenance office phone numbers where you can report a specific location of a heavily littered site or road hazard.  These numbers are located within the Litter Sweep link.  The report will be taken by the person answering the phone - they will take the appropriate action base on the situation reported.



We know more needs to be done and we are working to that end.



Thank you again for writing.



Sincerely,



George Kapetanakis

Subject: Trash on highways...

Comment: I know there are far more pressing issues, but my husband and I are appalled at the amount of trash on the sides of highways through out parts of North Carolina. Today we drove from Pinehurst to Durham, and Rt 1 through Apex and Cary looked like a Third World Country. We have never, ever seen such a sight. I-40 was also pretty bad, but upon our return there were workers collecting it. Obviously there are disrespectful individuals simply throwing their bags of trash, as well as furniture and household items etc... Perhaps there could be stricter fines and enforcement with rewards offered to those who report offenders. We drive a lot of highways up and down the east coast and have never seen anything as bad as what we see here in NC. It's embarassing when out of state guests come. Thank you, Laura Stevens

Email: eddietodd1@carolina.rr.com

Subject: P&N Railroad

Comment: The NCDOT is planning to re-open the P&N line from Charlotte to Gastonia at a cost of over $5 million dollars. This is going to adversley affect many homeowners along the route. In Mt.  Holly, the Rhyne's Estate and Rhyne's Trace subdivisions will have trains running through their back yards within 75 feet of their houses. This is not the way we want to live in our very peaceful neighborhood. The worst part about this is the economic times we are in and the state DOT is going to spend $5.5 million to refurbish this rail line for one man (Mr. Bill Gray) at the Central Carolina Railroad for one or two customers that are textile related and as you already know, textiles are rapidly leaving Gaston County. I think this money could be spent in much more productive ways. Thank you, George Todd, Jr.

Dear Ms. Jones:

Your email to the Governor's office has been forwarded to me for response.

Unfortunately, because of the poor economy and in particular, the financial hit the NC Department of Transportation has taken, tough decisions have had to be made. The NCDOT has a projected budget shortfall of more than $300 million for the 2008-2009 fiscal year. That has forced the Department to postpone about 75 percent of its projects, and to lay off its temporary and part-time employees across the state, with more cuts expected. In addition, no vacant permanent positions will be filled unless they are considered an essential position. In addition, no promotions or other salary adjustments may be made.

Facing an expected $2 billion deficit for this fiscal year, Governor Perdue has ordered all state agencies to cut their budgets by at least seven percent, and this week told members of the Council of State that agency personnel managers need to update their procedures for possible layoffs of full-time, permanent workers.

We acknowledge that the loss of valuable workers such as your husband and nephew means service such as snow and ice clearing and road maintenance won't be at the same level as in past years. But simply put, there isn't enough money right now to continue as we have in the past, and state government leaders are going to have to make painful moves, and probably will have to continue to do so into the next fiscal year as well.

I'm sorry that I couldn't provide a more positive position on the situation.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Subject: Department Of Transportation Layoff

Comment: My first question, I am wondering who do we call in the Nantahala Community next Monday when this new snow system is forecasted to hit, when my elderly father gets sick which of my elected officials are going to come help us in the forgotten corner. I worked the election booths on election day for the democratic party. I am wondering if I should have been working for the republican party as a democrat. I understand that most of you have no clue where we are located or that we are even a part of NC. But we are located in one the most pristine parts of NC, many companies here and business rely on tourism and with our roads in bad shape, how is the state going to feel when the tourist industry falls and you aren't getting all those tax dollars we, my husband went to work this morning for the last time with DOT, I work in real estate. My nephew was also went in for his last day with DOT today. When the come to foreclose our homes, which of our elected officials are going to be there to help us. These aren't men that just started working with DOT, these are men that had been there for 3 and more yrs. The state Mrs. Perdue bought Grandfather  Mountain with tax payers money. I am sorry but who wanted it. It will be used at collateral for china to loan us more money. We have a serious problem, we have been left with only 3 DOT workers, we only had 6. The 3 left with aren't even in the same county and while millions was wasted on Onion Mountain Road project that connects Franklin to Cullowee, which was wasteful and useless because if it cannot be maintained why build it. We don't have the luxury of traveling flat uncurny road as the people in the larger cities do. We had a teen get killed in a car crash last summer no guard rails, her car hit a tree. The week after she was killed they put up guard in front of the cross and flowers that had been put there by her classmates. Ironic don't you think, can the state afford to lay off the workers that keep our roads safe, for our children and emergencies workers, for our elderly, can the state afford to pay the bills for the funerals, the bills of families unable to get to work? I ask can North Carolina truly afford these added expenses. It will happen and someone will be left to pick up and take responsibility. I ask can the State afford this? Thank you Dwayna Jones

Hi,

I had Dan Grissom, the Division Construction Engineer handling this project, ready to contact Mr. Profitt. However, he received a phone call from State Representative Mitchell Setzer (who represents Catawba and Iredell counties), who said he had already talked to Mr. Profitt, had taken care of his concerns and there was no need for us to call him as well. Apparently Mr. Profitt had also contacted Rep. Setzer.

This section of Interstate 40 is as rough if not worse than before the resurface project began. I honestly do not believe our tax dollars are being used wisely.

Hi,

Since Mr. Todd filed a tort claim, this is a legal matter with the NCDOT as the defendant and the Attorney General's office handling the case. Per Department policy, we can't have any correspondence with him from our office while the legal process is under way.

As an FYI, it can sometimes be months before a ruling is issued on a claim. Mr. Todd could find out more about the process by contacting the Industial Commission at (919) 807-2500.

Subject: road debri / car damage

Comment: I'm in a logjam with the NCDOT who is per their web site page under Maintenance responsible for road debri removal. I incidently struck road debri on a NC highway in a Work Zone. This debri not removed cost me 150.00 in tow fees and a 250.00 insurance deductable fee. The insurance company I have took care of the 2800.00 plus bill. I have filed claims and now a TORT Claim T-1. Please advise me as to what to do to get this negligent act on the NCDOT sub contractor who is responsible for debri removal paid. I pay insurance to get me car repaired and I'm sure NCDOT pays insurance to keep road ways clear. See Todd vs. NC Dept of Transportation file # 08-1969. Your help or direction in this matter is appreciated. Iredell County I77S @ mile marker 31 jtodd 704 763 3850

Hi,

This is the same citizen we responded about last Friday (see copy below). We also checked and it turned out the person he communicated with at Maymead was the controller, Tom Purpur, who has had no involvement with the construction aspect of the project and had no information regarding his claim. Mr. Purpur has since sent NCDOT Division Construction Engineer Dan Grissom an apology for sending such a response to Mr. Profitt.

Steve



RESPONSE FROM LAST FRIDAY

Hi,

I had Dan Grissom, the Division Construction Engineer handling this project, ready to contact Mr. Profitt. However, he received a phone call from State Representative Mitchell Setzer (who represents Catawba and Iredell counties), who said he had already talked to Mr. Profitt, had taken care of his concerns and there was no need for us to call him as well. Apparently Mr. Profitt had also contacted Rep. Setzer.

Comment: Mrs Perdue The response I received from Maymead company. This is the company repaving the stretch of Interstate 40 from Iredell to Burke county. Mr. Profitt, Yes, we are aware of the rough ride. The NC  DOT had us pave over buckled concrete and asphalt conforms to the surface below it. I believe they also had us patch concrete with asphalt, which just isn’t done. In any case, the NC  DOT has some engineering issues to work out and as I understand it, we are on hold until the NC  DOT reworks its plans. Thank you for your feedback. Tom Purpur - Maymead I know one of the things you ran on in your campaign was NCDOT reform. Please take time to look into this for the hard working tax paying residents of Catawba  County. Thanks for your time. God Bless.

Dear Ms. Richardson;

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to NCDOT for response. We appreciate your concern about the tree line along I-85. During the planning phase of this project nearly 10 years ago, Durham officials expressed concern about the removal of the natural tree buffer along the edge of this  location. As a result of those conversations, a reforestation agreement was established to reduce the impact on nearby neighborhoods and businesses. The installation of trees serves several purposes, including as an environmental buffer and for erosion control, as well as for aesthetic improvement.

Primarily, native trees were installed as a planned component of this effort, and according to the NCDOT Roadside Environmental Office that oversees Durham County, the trees are spaced above the minimum recommended spacing for each species. There is a small percentage included in construction money designated for the reforestation of the roadsides. This contract, like all DOT contracts, was handled through normal procedure, with proper advertisement and competition, and then awarded to the lowest qualified bidder.   

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Have you been on I-85 in northern Durham lately? Hundreds of trees are being planted along this interstate even in places where there is already a natural buffer. And they are planted so close together, they are practically on top of each other. I see this as a blatant waste of taxpayers money. Who owns the nursey that got this BIG bonuse and who is DOT is getting a kcick back?

Dear Mrs. Dalton:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to the NCDOT for response. As you are aware, the department has laid off a majority of its temporary employee workforce due to budget issues. This decision was made on a statewide basis. Anticipated revenues reflected a 35% reduction for the fiscal year of July 2008 thru June 2009 and an actual impact to division operations of 70%.

Murphy is located in Division 14, where the layoffs were implemented in late December and January. Other divisions began implementing similar layoffs earlier in November. Additionally, new contracts were not advertised, existing contracts were delayed where possible, and purchasing has been delayed or eliminated. Even severe measures like this still required all of our 14 divisions across the state to share spending capacities to make it through the fiscal year.

Division 14 historically keeps a high number of temporary employees compared to the rest of the state. This is mostly because of the need for laborers and because the division does not have access to inmate labor as do many other divisions across the state. The large geographical area and access issues the mountains present also contribute to this arrangement. In total, Division 14 laid off approximately 150 temporary employees. The nature of our temporary employment is to have available workers as needs dictate. Traditionally this need has been based on project loads, schedules and seasons. However, available funding is also a factor. As things improve, we anticipate restoring our temporary workforce. We regret that your husband was one of the temporaries that was laid off. We certainly hope that things will improve soon.

Should you have specific questions regarding Division 14 and any active projects such as the ones you reference, please contact our Division Engineer, Joel Setzer, at 828-586-2141. Thank you for your comments and concerns as we work through this very difficult time.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Subject: Job Lay-Off

Comment: My husband was recently laid off from the NC DOT because he was a temporary employee and the budget was low. Then after doing a little research for myself I found out that alot of the landscape and road maintenance in our area (Cherokee County) is contracted out mostly to companies not even in our area. Now tell me why my husband was laid off from his job in a county where we pay taxes and the state is contracting out work to others when we need the jobs for our families here in at home. We have the equipment for the jobs and plenty of able bodies that would love to go out and work and to once again support their families. This lay off was completely ridiculous and has distroyed alot of lives. I will continue to do my research and find out how this could be allowed to happen. I will not stop until I get some answers. I am a working mother with a jobless husband and a 6 year old daughter that has to work double shifts 5 days a week just to make ends meet. I would appreciate a response. Thank you!

Dear Ms. Lynn:
Your e-mail to the Governor's web site was forwarded to me for response. The Western Wake Freeway is not a project being handled by the NC Department of Transportation, but is scheduled to be built by the NC Turnpike Authority as part of the Triangle Expressway toll road, which will also include the Triangle Parkway and the already existing Northern Wake Expressway (NC 540).

For specific details and information you will need to check with the Turnpike Authority. But I can tell you that the 12.6-mile Western Wake Freeway, which will go from a junction with NC 55 near RTP to a junction with the NC 55 Bypass near Holly Springs has had its federal environmental impact statement completed, with the next step being the final design. That in turn will help determine the cost, which right now is estimated at nearly $784 million. Then the funding will have to be obtained.

Regarding a timeline for construction, I have to defer to the NCTA. You can check its web site at <http://www.ncturnpike.org>www.ncturnpike.org.  That site also has contact information such as email address, phone number, fax number and mailing address for the Authority so you can let it know your stance on the issue.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Dear Mr. Norris:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. North Carolina has many important transportation needs and the N.C. Department of Transportation is working hard to distribute limited funding to communities across the state. The Charlotte area is a priority for NCDOT and we continue to make improvements to the highway system in that area, but we must also address needs in the rest of the state.

The completion of the I-485 loop is currently scheduled to begin construction in 2015. Simply put, there isn't any money to do the work earlier unless new funding sources are found. To date, the Charlotte area has received nearly $1 billion in designated urban loop funding to construct I-485. That is more than any other city has received, but admittedly more is needed. That being said, the construction date to complete I-485 could change as a result of the Economic Stimulus package. The NCDOT has requested $122.6 million dollars in federal funds as part of that request specifically for completing that final loop section. If a significant portion of the request would be granted, then it is feasible  that the start of the final leg of the Charlotte loop project could be moved up, with work starting in 2010 or 2011. The state would still need to come up with additional funding to complete the project, but it would be a start.

As for the Fayetteville loop (I-295) project, it has been in the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) for 30 years. In the 2009-2015 STIP it was scheduled to begin construction by 2010, while because of funding issues, projects scheduled to begin after 2011, such as I-485 and loop projects in Winston-Salem and Greensboro, were delayed and no funding is in place for loop projects in Raleigh. The planned nine-mile section of I-295 will not come close to completing its loop, but will provide Fort Bragg with its first direct link to an interstate, and was a key reason for the Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision in 2005 to recommend a major expansion of Fort Bragg, which is expected to grow by 40,000 people. However, because of the current economic conditions, even the planned awarding of a contract for the Fayetteville loop has been delayed.

To give you an idea of how far loop construction has gone in  North Carolina, I'm including the chart below to show you the status of completion of the 10 designated urban loops and you will see that Charlotte is ahead of all other cities:

Loop city         Loop miles     Miles completed        Pct. completed
----------        -----------      -----------------        ---------------

Dear Ms. Howie:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. DOT 10 is a personalized plate, and not an assigned state government license plate. As such, any 
individual who pays the extra annual $30 fee to put a personal plate on their personal car can place anything he or she would like on their vehicle, as long as the DMV determines it is not offensive to good taste and decency. It is possible this person has had this same plate for several years, and we can't expect someone to change their license plate number because of changing economic conditions.

Memorandum To:         Frank Gioscio



From:                           Angela M. Faulk. NCDOT Human Resources Director



Subject:                        NCDOT Positions and Responsibilities



Date:                            February 20, 2009





Dear Mr. Gioscio:



This is in response to an e-mail we received on information you sent to the Office of the Governor on Tuesday, February 17, 2009 relating to NCDOT positions and responsibilities.  The positions that were referred to in the e-mail are assigned to the central Construction Unit.  Due to increases in duties and responsibilities, these positions (Transportation Engineer IIIs SG 78) were studied in July 2008 for a reclassification. Based on results from the review, the positions were reallocated up to Transportation Staff Engineer (TSE) IVs (SG 80). When the TSE IVs were crosswalked during the career banding conversion in November 2008, they were placed at the Engineer Advanced level.  This is the same level as the TE IIIs.



The duties and responsibilities of the TSE IVs are very different from the Transportation Engineering Supervisor (TES) IIs (Resident Engineers) (SG 79).  These positions serve as technical experts for critical construction operations contracts that affect final quality as well as new or unique construction methods for all division let and centrally let highway construction projects.  They provide formal and informal training to project engineering and inspection staff to ensure all construction details are properly monitored.  The Bridge and Roadway Construction Engineers (TSE IVs) have a thorough understanding of the Unit’s construction program, as well as a global understanding and working knowledge of the Department.  They serve as regional project managers and are charged with ensuring timely program delivery.



As regional project managers, these TSE IV positions are assigned responsibility (either bridge or roadway) for overseeing two Divisions. They are responsible for making decisions within the two Division areas (Bridge or Roadway) that each is assigned.  Sometimes these decisions involve overriding the TES IIs (Resident Engineers) in the field.  These positions review all supplemental agreements, active claims, moderate Construction Close-Out Conferences between Contractors and Division Staff.  Their duties are much more complex as it relates to variety and complexity, decision making/consequence of error, and analytical requirements due to the exposure they have within their assigned two Divisions. They are essentially on the “front line” conducting daily business, having to make decisions whose effects are felt within the assigned area related to the construction projects.



Typically from two to six TES IIs are assigned within each of the fourteen Divisions’ Construction areas.  The TES IIs were crosswalked over to the Engineering Supervisor Journey level.  These supervisors, depending on location, typically manage from one to two squads.  These squads usually consist of one or two lower level Engineers and varying levels of Engineering Technicians.  These supervisors spend a considerable amount of time performing the more complex, controversial or advanced work of their squads.  These positions are only responsible for their squads’ construction projects.  Their classification and level is driven by the supervision they perform and the complexity of their duties and responsibilities. Were it not for this supervision, they would be classified as Transportation Engineer IIs or the banded classification of Engineer – Journey not Engineering Supervisor – Journey. 



The Bridge and Roadway Construction Engineers have multiple assigned areas and have responsibility over those areas as it relates to bridges and roadway projects.  These positions have the authority to override a Resident Engineer’s decision but the opposite is not the case.  These positions are considered the highest level of technical staff work involved in engineering oriented problem solving.  It is for these reasons, the positions were reallocated up back in July 2008 and are more complex than the Division Construction Transportation Engineering Supervisor II.

Visitor: Mr. Frank Gioscio

Address: 489 Country Place Drive, Boone, NC 28607

Email: fgioscio@bellsouth.net

Subject: NCDOT Positions and Responsibilities

Comment: I am a Resident Engineer for the Construction office in Boone. I have 25 years experience with the NCDOT and have been a Resident Engineer since 1988 in Division 11. The NCDOT has Area Engineers that work out of the Construction Unit in Raleigh. They provide several types of technical expertise to the Divisions. They have no employees that they supervise on a daily basis. No projects are assigned to them to look after on a daily basis, etc. (I have 18 employees in my office, 65 - 70 million dollars of contract construction that I am responsible for, etc.) Sometime last fall the Area Engineer's positions were upgraded above what a Resident Engineer is. Before this upgrade, a Resident Engineer who accepted one of these positions actually went down one pay grade to become one of these engineers. (In essence, took a demotion in order to perform this new job!!!!) Several of the Engineers received a 15% raise and others received a 10% raise as part of this upgrade. A typical candidate for one of these Area Engineer's positions is a Resident Engineer. Nobody will explain why a person can switch jobs, take on less responsibility and get a hefty raise to boot!!! There are Area Engineers that actually make more money than Division Construction Engineers who are responsible for multiple Construction offices with 50 to 60 employees. This is not good for the moral of the employees and should be investigated. Equity should be restored and those who work and take on responsibility should be compensated fairly. I am sorry about the lengthly post, but just needed to put this out in the open for a response from somebody who cares. I know that nothing can be done due to the economic downturn, but for future reference this should be corrected. I am awaiting a response. Thank you for your time>

Mr. Huffman,

Your email to the Governor's Office was referred to me for a response.

There have been two independent traffic signal studies for this intersection. The first, by Division Three staff, concluded this intersection does not meet warrants for signalization.

At the request of Senator Brown and Representative Grady, the State Traffic Engineer performed a Traffic Signal Viability Study independent of Division Three's study. It reviewed the most recent five-year crash history as well as traffic volumes from September 2008 while the signal was in operation. The crash history does not indicate anything unusual for an intersection of this type. The volume counts were well below the amount required to warrant a signal as specified in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.  

It concluded "An onsite investigation was conducted showing that adequate gaps were present in the US 258 traffic that safely allows left turns from the Piggly Wiggly and Exxon entrances since the signal was placed in the flash mode. After careful examination, the signal is not warranted at this time and removal is justified based upon the engineering data. The guidelines for removing a traffic signal outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices will be followed while scheduling the removal of this signal."


If you have questions concerning this matter, please feel free to contact Joe Chance of the NCDOT at (910) 251-5724.



Sincerely,

Allen Pope, PE

Division Engineer

Dear Mr. Lewis:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. As you are aware, the department laid off a majority of its temporary employee workforce due to budget issues. This decision was made on a statewide basis. Anticipated revenues reflected a 35% reduction for the fiscal year of July 2008 thru June 2009 and an actual impact to division operations of 70%. Simply put, we couldn't afford to keep staffing at the same level as in the past. In Division 14, including the Polk County office,  layoffs were implemented in late December and January. Other divisions began similar layoffs earlier in November. Additionally, new contracts have not been advertised, existing contracts have been  delayed where possible, and purchasing has been delayed or eliminated. Even severe measures like this haven't been enough, as all of our 14 divisions across the state are share spending capacities to make it through the fiscal year.

Division 14 historically keeps a high number of temporary employees compared to the rest of the state. This is mostly because of the need for laborers and because the division does not have access to inmate labor as do many other divisions across the state. The large geographical area and access issues the mountains present also contribute to this arrangement. In total, Division 14 laid off approximately 150 temporary employees. The nature of our temporary employment is to have available workers as needs dictate. Traditionally this need has been based on project loads, schedules and seasons. However, available funding is also a factor. As things improve, we anticipate restoring our temporary workforce. While the Economic Stimulus funding is aimed at specific projects where for the most part temporary workers are not needed, we are hopeful that the money we receive will enable us to resume funding of our own for projects that would be served best by temporary workers. Unfortunately, we have no timetable for when the situation will change and hiring could begin, although we certainly hope that things will improve soon.

Should you have specific questions regarding Division 14, please contact Division Engineer Joel Setzer at 828-586-2141.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Dear Mr. Struble:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response.

Plans for the U.S. 1 project were developed over five years with input and agreements between the Department of Transportation, the Town of Cary, neighborhood groups and individual citizens. Initially, there was great concern over the exposure to the visual and noise impacts of the new roadway.  The consensus was that DOT would attempt to provide a dense natural vegetated buffer in those areas where no noise wall was proposed. Additionally, the Town of Cary agreed to participate help cover the cost of ornamental type plantings above the level of reforestation.

 In 2007, the landscape plan showing this dense reforestation was completed and accepted by all the parties listed above. They incorporated all of the Town of Cary’s requests for ornamental plantings, and reforestation between the Right of Way fence and clear zone areas where no noise wall was built. Quantities for reforestation were based on the industry standard formula of about 300 trees per acre, spaced 8-12’ apart. To re-vegetate bare areas after the project clearing phase and to supplement the remaining understory, reforestation included a mix of predominately native trees including evergreen, and deciduous material was installed.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Office

Hi,

We had already responded last month to this request, with this letter sent to Chief Locklear of the Tuscarora Nation of North Carolina. His initial request had gone to a Board member.

Mr. Leon Locklear

Chief, Tuscarora Nation of North Carolina, Inc.

288 Tuscarora Nation Road

Maxton, NC  28364



Dear Chief Locklear:



Board Member Mac Campbell has asked this office to respond to your request for an additional sign on the segment of I-74 in Robeson County designated as the “American Indian Highway”.



The Board of Transportation’s Road and Bridge Naming Policies and Procedures state an honorary designation cannot exceed five (5) miles with a sign located at each terminus (total of two signs).  The mileage and number of installed signs on the American Indian Highway actually exceeds our current procedures.  The Department allowed extra signs at the I-95 interchange in 2007 (for a total of five currently installed signs).



The Department makes every effort to apply our policies and procedures consistently and fairly across the state. We often receive requests for more signs for honorary designations than can be approved.  



The Department feels the current signs along the American Indian Highway segment are sufficient to inform the traveling motorists of the honorary designation and more signs are not needed.



If you have further questions please feel to contact this office for assistance.



Sincerely,





Sandy Nance

State Highway Administrator’s Office

On behalf of the Tuscarora Nation, I want to thank you for your general assistance and for listening to our concerns. Your assistance is greatly appreciated and needed.



It is my understanding that five American Indian Highway signs have been erected and placed along I-74 in Robeson County, North Carolina by the Department of Transportation. The location of the current American Indian Highway signs extends on I-74 East of Maxton and I-95.

With much regret, I inform you with this letter of request for one additional American Indian Highway sign to be erected and placed on the Robeson and Scotland County line on I-74. Having the proper location on the American Indian Highway signs will give efforts in tribal justice to our ancestors, land, and generations yet unborn. We as the people and as American Indians, have been openly discriminated and raped for more than five hundred years in this great State of North Carolina.

Currently in Robeson  County, American Indians make up approximately 40 percent of the given population and have made significant contributions to this county as such. American Indians and many local citizens, who reside on the Robeson and Scotland  County line, continuously complain about the injustice and inappropriateness of the North Carolina Department of Transpo

	2/24/2009 9:25:29 AM 	Dear Ms. Reynolds:

Any movement on the Winston-Salem urban loop project is on hold because two activist groups filed a federal lawsuit last year against the NCDOT, USDOT and other parties, alleging laws regarding environmental-impact studies weren't followed. A federal judge in Durham is considering whether to issue an injunction to halt the project until new studies are conducted, with no set timetable for when a ruling might be made. Once the lawsuit is addressed, we expect to move forward with the project. The budget situation at that time and the planned schedule for the project will play a major role on how and when we can proceed.

Dear Mr. Swain,

I write as the Chair for the River District Design Review Committee for the City of Asheville to express our concerns related to the proposed Bridge Replacement Project for Biltmore Avenue as it crosses over the Swannanoa River. 

Know that we appreciate the fact that this bridge will be replaced, as it has fallen into considerable disrepair.  Our concerns:

• We strongly encourage that the quatrefoil railing design evident on the west side of the bridge be retained. (see attached photo)

<file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg>

• We strongly encourage that the railing allow for “seeing” the river.

• We strongly encourage addressing the issues of connectivity to allow for comfortable bicycle and pedestrian traffic flow .

• We strongly encourage the use of historic lighting fixtures with limited light dispersion angles that are of sufficient quality so as not to “peel”. (as the paint on the light posts on the McDowell Bridge already have.  See photo below)

<file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image005.jpg>

• We strongly encourage that the underside of the bridge be constructed so as to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic at a later date. (see attached sketch and photos)

<file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image007.jpg><file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image009.jpg>

• We strongly encourage that the scale of the railing be appropriate to the smaller scale/setting of this bridge, as compared to the McDowell Street Bridge. (see attached photos)

<file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image010.jpg><file://localhost/Users/pattiy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip1/01/clip_image011.jpg>

• We strongly encourage that the new bridge compliment the vision set out in the Wilma Dykeman Riverway Plan.

• We strongly encourage that all provisions possible to help eliminate flood water constriction be implemented here.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Purvis:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. It sounds like you are referring to our practice of sometimes building a temporary detour bridge to carry traffic while the replacement bridge is being constructed.  This practice is normally used on our primary routes and heavily traveled secondary system bridges if there is not a suitable "offsite" detour, meaning another route to temporarily detour traffic on to.  Offsite detours are what we like to use, but if the offsite route is unsuitable (weak pavement structure, poor alignment, residential neighborhoods, long detour length, etc.), we use either the temporary detour bridge or use staged construction to build the new bridge, which is the other option you mentioned. However, staged construction is usually quite expensive and sometimes the bridge design does not lend itself to staged construction.

You can be assured we look at these different possibilities, and appreciate your interest in having the NCDOT use the most cost effective and safest way to handle traffic while we replace our bridges.

Subject: Highways and Bridges

Comment: I have lived in North Carolina for 14 years now. I have noticed that when they repair a bridge, they build a new bridge and build a new highway to go to the new bridge. Then they fix the old bridge and when they're finished repairing the old one they tear down the new one. That makes no sense to me. Wouldn't it save thousands of dollars for materials and man hours. Just to repair the old bridge one lane at the time. Or make a detour? Then we could use the money in other areas? Maybe in health care coverage?

Dear Ms. Elliott:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. Thank you for sharing your concerns about the US 501 project in Person County. As you mention, the widening of US 501 was identified as a need for Roxboro and Person County a number of years ago. Unfortunately, this type of project must compete for funding with many other projects across the state and it is nearly impossible for NCDOT to meet everyone's local priorities with the limited funding available. Due to this, the schedule for this project has had to move many times.

Project R-2241 is actually split into three sections. Section "A" (R-2241A) covers the highway from NC 49 in Roxboro to Halifax Road, while Section "B" (R-2241B) goes from Halifax Road to Old NC 501, and Section "C" (R-2241C) goes from Old NC 501 to just north of the Virginia State Line. 

The current schedule for the "A" section is for Right of Way to be under way in the 2008-2009 fiscal year and construction to start in fiscal year 2012. NCDOT's Right of Way Branch has made some contacts and even property purchases for the "A" portion, but as for now we have had to stop making Right of Way contacts and purchases due to the troubled economic situation our department is facing. 

Unfortunately, we can't give you a timetable for when the Right of Way business for Section "A" will resume, but we are still anticipating it will be completed in time to let construction begin as scheduled in 2012. And we have not changed the schedule for the rest of the project. Right of way for the "B" section remains scheduled to begin in 2015, while the construction schedule for "B" and the right of way and construction schedules for "C" are not set as those parts of the overall project have not yet been funded.

As you likely know, state and federal revenues for transportation are down due to the economic issues our state and country are facing. We are optimistic that there will be a turnaround in the near future, but all of the above is subject to change depending on the availability of funds. NCDOT works closely with the local governments through the Kerr-Tar Rural Planning Organization and will continue to update local officials on any changes.

Thanks again for your input. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact NCDOT Division 5 Deputy Engineer Joey Hopkins, who supplied the information for this letter, at (919) 220-4600.


Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Does the State vs. Bowe case not apply to all cases or do we have to follow the process that was started in the case stated above?  Should lawyers and judges not know the law?  I think someone should have known that Jeremy could not be granted a limited driving privilege before we spent  so much time and money to meet the rules outlined by the judge.  We  understand the revoked licenses and I totally agree with that but  no allowing a person to drive to and from work , school, etc... just because they are 20 instead of 21 does not make sense.

Mr. Bridges;  We appreciate your using our service and letting us know of your concerns with the proposed new schedule.  We will take all concerns into account before we publish our final schedule but I cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all concerns.  Because we are having to transfer employees from some locations to others to meet our new manning requirements (system wide) we are having to reduce our schedules at most operations including Cherry Branch.  We are having to switch from a 3 crew schedule to a 2 crew schedule at Cherry Branch.  This only allows us to operate one ferry in the morning and evening with them overlapping in the afternoon.  We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have on our many loyal passengers but we are doing the best we can to provide as much service to as many people as possible.

Concerning the proposed schedule, to put it bluntly, IT SUCKS.



Most people from Minnesott side start work at 6:30 or 7:00 am. For those that catch the 5:45 from Minnesott, they will have to get up earlier. For the 5:35.

I ride the 6:15 from Minnesott to be at work at 7 am.

The 6:25 will not work. I will be late everyday. The people that use the 6:15 and 6:45 ferry from Minnesott will have to use the 6:25. There will be many people left having to wait an hour before the next ferry. I guess I will have to see the boss about adjusting my hours.

Hopefully I can adjust my hours. I believe there will be more people driving through New Bern if this schedule is used.

The proposed schedule in the afternoon is a NO-GO.

I will be driving through New Bern in the afternoon. I get off at 3:30. I can not get to ferry to catch the 3:45. I will not wait till the 4:15 because I can be home by then by driving through New Bern. I hate that I will miss my evening nap on the ferry and that I will be putting more miles on my vehicle and that I will spend more on gas.

Currently, by riding the ferry my commute mileage for a week is 200 miles. This proposed schedule will increase my commute mileage to 400 miles per week because I will not be using the ferry because of the changed schedule.  

Also my extra cost of gas will be about 30 dollars a week at the current price of gas.

So the schedule will be increasing everyone’s cost for gas because I think more people on Minnesott side will drive through New Bern.

The base commuters get off at 3:00 or 3:30. The commuters getting off at 3PM can not catch the 3:15 and the ones getting off at 3:30 can not catch the 3:45.

These commuters will have a 25 minute wait.

I believe more people will drive through New Bern.



A 6:05 or 6:15 from Minnesott is good. There are at least 16 to 22 cars that ride the 6:15 from Minnesott. I used to ride the 6:05 from Minnesott.

The current 3:55 from Cherry Branch side is very accommodating for me.

Since the 3:35 was cancelled more people have been riding the 3:55 because the base workers have difficulty catching the existing 3:25 from Cherry Branch.

When the ferry went to the recent new schedule there were 5 cars left at Cherry Branch side every day for the 3:55 when the small ferry was being used. I have been left once when I left work 5 minutes later than normal.



Can you run double ferries for 3 hours in the morning and 2 to 3 hours in the afternoon commute time?

It is hard for me to believe there is enough traffic to run the double ferries between 1:45 and 4:15 and not in the morning hours.

This schedule seems to benefit the summer tourists and not the residents that live in the area. The tourists are here for only 4 months out of the year. We are here year round.



Bottom line the proposed schedule SUCKS.



Recommend to the governor, take that stimulus money for a superhighway from I-95 or HWY  70 to the GTP and build a bridge across the Neuse at Cherry Branch.

Dear Ms. Jones:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. As you are aware, the department laid off a majority of its temporary employee workforce due to budget issues. This decision was made on a statewide basis. Anticipated revenues reflected a 35% reduction for the fiscal year of July 2008 thru June 2009 and an actual impact to division operations of 70%. Simply put, we couldn't afford to keep staffing at the same level as in the past because we didn't have the money.

In Division 14, including the Macon County office, layoffs were implemented in late December and January. Other divisions began similar layoffs earlier in November. Additionally, new contracts were not advertised, existing contracts were delayed where possible, and purchasing has been delayed or eliminated. Even severe measures like this haven't been enough, as all of our 14 divisions across the state are share spending capacities to make it through the fiscal year.

Division 14 historically keeps a high number of temporary employees compared to the rest of the state. This is mostly because of the need for laborers and because the division does not have access to inmate labor as do many other divisions across the state. The large geographical area and access issues the mountains present also contribute to this arrangement. In total, Division 14 laid off approximately 150 temporary employees. The nature of our temporary employment is to have available workers as needs dictate. Traditionally this need has been based on project loads, schedules and seasons. However, available funding is also a factor.

As things improve, we anticipate restoring our temporary workforce. Unfortunately, we have no timetable for when the situation will change and hiring could begin, although we certainly hope that things will improve soon. The Economic Stimulus funding is aimed at specific projects which for the most part will not require temporary workers, but we are hopeful that the money we receive for those projects will enable us to resume funding of our own for projects that would be served best by temporary workers, and lead to re-hiring. Should you have specific questions regarding Division 14, please contact Division Engineer Joel Setzer at 828-586-2141.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Comment: I just read the article about Mrs. Perdue plan for NC roads, does this mean that they are going to put all the laid off employees back to work or is this just to put off the public about road other than those in Raleigh and Charlotte? We are all wondering in the western counties if once again we made a mistake by voting for our current elected officials. Her plans are for more infrastructor and we dont have people to take care of the roads we have now. I would really like to know how she plans on living up to her promises of people not losing their jobs with DOT?

Dear Mr. Giles:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response. As you are aware, the department laid off a majority of its temporary employee workforce due to budget issues. This decision was made on a statewide basis. Anticipated revenues are down 35% for the fiscal year of July 2008 thru June 2009, compared to last year. Simply put, we couldn't afford to keep staffing at the same level as in the past because we didn't have the money.

In Division 14, including the Jackson County office, layoffs were implemented in late December and January. Other divisions began similar layoffs earlier in November. Additionally, new contracts were not advertised, existing contracts were delayed where possible, and purchasing has been delayed or eliminated. Even severe measures like this haven't been enough, as all of our 14 divisions across the state are share spending capacities to make it through the fiscal year.

Division 14 historically keeps a high number of temporary employees compared to the rest of the state. This is mostly because of the need for laborers and because the division does not have access to inmate labor as do many other divisions across the state. The large geographical area and access issues the mountains present also contribute to this arrangement. In total, Division 14 laid off approximately 150 temporary employees. The nature of our temporary employment is to have available workers as needs dictate. Traditionally this need has been based on project loads, schedules and seasons, so when projects are delayed or cancelled, as we have had to do, then there isn't the need for as many workers. Available funding is also a factor and the department has had to cut its budget by 9 percent, with additional cuts expected.

We anticipate and are hoping to restore our temporary workforce as those employees play an important role within the department. Unfortunately, because of the state budget situation, we have no timetable for when the situation will change and we can begin hiring them back. Should you have specific questions regarding Division 14, please contact Division Engineer Joel Setzer at 828-586-2141.

Dear Mr. Henson:

Your email to the Governor's office was forwarded to me for response. 

Because of the current economic situation, the original design of the project you refer to has been revised significantly since the public hearing held in 2007. We are currently proposing a design that mainly improves the I-40/US-21 interchange. This will include work being done from the I-40/I-77 interchange to the I-40/US-21 interchange. No work is currently being proposed south of the I-77 interchange, therefore Beechwood Road would not be impacted by this current design. 

In addition, Beechwood Road will not be utilized as a truck turnaround. The grade on Beechwood Road was raised for two reasons: (1) the existing vertical grade is almost 15 percent, which causes the tie-in at Broad Street to be unsafe, so we raised the grade to provide a safer tie-in at Broad Street, and (2) the widening of 
I-77 creates the need for a longer bridge on Broad Street. This in turn raises its vertical grade, which also negatively impacts the tie-in at Beechwood Road, requiring the raising of the vertical grade on Beechwood Road. 

Despite the changes, the NCDOT is still planning to buy the right of way for the original design that was shown at the public hearing, even though we are not building that design at this time. This was decided so that we could save the state money by already having the necessary right of way to build the design in the future.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott

Comment: NC DOT IS WIDENING TO 8 LANES AT INTERCHANGE AND INTERCHANGES NORTH AND SOUTH OF EXIT50 WIDENING A PORTION OF BEECHWOOD ROAD AT EXIT 50 FOR TRUCK TURN AROUND. NO TRUCKS COME INTO THE AREA. IT IS POSTED "NO OUTLET". NC DOT WANTS TO RAISE LOWEST PART OF BEECHWOOD 12 FEET FOR NO REASON. AT MEETING IN STATESVILE,NC IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED. THE MONIES COULD BE USED FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION THAT IS NECESSARY IN OTHER PARTS OF STATE. OWNERS WERE TOLD THAT THEY HAD NO RECOURSE EXCEPT TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY. IN TIMES OF BUDGET SHORTAGES, COULD WE CUT OUR EXPENSES BY STOPPING THIS CONSTRUCTION? GOVERNOR PERDUE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THANK YOU, STEVE HENSON 7045065192 shenson@basicsplus.net

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Your email to the Governor's office was referred to me for response.

As you mention, the NCDOT contract language includes a 12-month guarantee provision. This provision requires that the contractor guarantee materials and workmanship against latent and patent defects arising from faulty materials, faulty workmanship or negligence for a period of 12 months following the date of final acceptance of the project. 

Concerning responsibility for the quality of work that has been done, a team of engineers reviews each project at approximately 10 months after the its acceptance date to determine if the guarantee provision needs to be invoked on a contract. If items of work which necessitate invoking the provision are found, a letter is sent to the contractor to make the necessary repairs. The same engineering team also completes a construction quality evaluation form, rating various components of the project and identifying specific improvements to avoid future occurrences. In addition, contractors who are awarded NCDOT construction projects are required to submit a contract payment bond and a contract performance bond each in an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount of the contract.
To further hold ourselves accountable for the work being done, the Department has developed budget and schedule metrics, and each project is evaluated upon completion to determine if the target metric is achieved. The Project Managers' performance is evaluated on those established metrics.
As for holding a contractor responsible for its work over a longer period of time, there are three trial projects where the guarantee was extended to three years for pavements. The Department is continuing to evaluate the use of extended project guarantees.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Comment: You have indicted that the priority of road REPAIR will be contolled by the "professionals" within the DOT. Will anybody be charged with the responsibility for the QUALITY of the work done? And that it be done on schedule and within the budget. As I have submitted before, in Europe the contractor has to be bonded in order to build and is responsible for the upkeep of the road should it fail within a specified period of time which is not "one year" as it has been in NC. Ususlly 5 to 10 years. You get a more expensive road that is cheaaper in the long run. Example is I40. Now for an educational system that teaches, has internal discipline and productive sports programs.

Good morning,

My name is Michael Hrabosky and am the owner of Total Lawn Care Solutions Inc., located outside of Greensboro, North Carolina.  Earlier today, I had the privilege of submitting proposals for contracts for Right of Way mowing and maintenance.  Specifically the were contract #'s : 
M-405 G-3 (41579.7.2 Loop), M-0405 G-2 (41549.7.1 Non-Loop) and, M-0405 G-1 (41549.7.1 Non-Loop).  

The bids process was promptly ended at 10:00 am,  as instructed by Kathy Smith.  The bids were opened and the documentation reviewed and forms completed by the Right of Way employees in the Greensboro office.  Kathy proceeded to announce the bid results, providing successful bid totals and the companies that received the recommendation for the contracts.  I notice that my figures were lower than the contractors awarded these bids. Before I had the chance to ask,  Kathy stated that, 2 of the 3 bids would have been awarded to another company, mine, however the proposal document was not the same as the one given out at the pre-bid meeting.  I waited until after the process was complete to speak with Kathy and her team.  Kathy explained that my form was not the exact form given out at the pre-bid meeting, my proposals were denied, however, would be sent to Raleigh for consideration, however was a high likelihood it would not be honored.  I would like to also point out, during the pre-bid meeting, no discussion took place on the first page format, as was discussed in great detail regarding the second signature page format and requirements.

The proposal document was not the original, because I transferred the information on the original form, which requires the numbers to be hand written, to an EXCEL spreadsheet, which with the correct formulas (matching the original document), would add my figures accurately.  In addition I had placed in the spreadsheet, formulas which would cross check my totals per line and indicate an error if the checks were not successful.  The items that were not included on my sheets were 1)  the page number and (2 the complete contract number (i.e. 41549.7.1 Non-Loop), the font was not the same as the original, however clear and readable.  Everything else was included, job quotes, totals (per mowing, per moth and per year), job locations, and more importantly the second pages containing my company name, my signature and corporate seal. I have attached the first page of the actual documents that I submitted.

As far as the dollar amounts and difference of my proposal vs. the awarded contractor, for Contract M-0405 G-1my bid was $6580.00 vs $8400.00, a difference of $1820.00, and for M-0405 G-3, my bid was $4970.00 vs. $6400.00, a difference of $1430.00.  The awarding of these contracts to myself  would save the State of North Carolina $3150.00.  Although just a small piece, unlike the numbers we are hearing from our government, trillions, billions and millions, I would be contributing toward the fiscal responsibility, we are so accustomed to hearing not only from our Governor, but also from our president, in some form or fashion.  In addition, the forms that still need to be hand written vs. automated are not only antiquated, but also inaccurate.

Please be clear, I am in no way faulting or blaming Kathy Smith or any members of their team for these comments, consideration and decision on my proposal contents.  They were just following instructions given to them.  My objection is that the same figures and totals that I submitted would be the same, regardless of which form I used.

I trust that you, my North Carolina Government Officials, will consider these circumstances when deciding if my proposals for these contracts are to be considered valid, and subsequently approved and awarded.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Michael Hrabosky
