Dear Governor Easley,

I understand you were interviewed last week by a local television station regarding tornado warning systems and other severe weather notification capabilities. I was traveling and missed the broadcast, but was told you talked about siren based solutions. Additionally, I read several articles in the News and Observer where you expressed a genuine interest in indentifying solutions that help protect people and their property in our state. One such article written recently by Martha Quillin, “Radios best bet against twisters” (http://www.newsobserver.com/print/sunday/city_state/story/1306204.html) was particularly interesting.

This article stated that information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will help protect lives and property and that everyone should buy a NOAA radio. That will only help if you’re sitting next to the radio in a time of need. I am a founder and Chairman of the Board at a RTP based start-up company Velleros, Inc. At Velleros, we believe there is a better way to get this critical and time sensitive information to people in harms way. Velleros has created a carrier grade mass alerting and notification application that enables telecom carriers to reliably notify their subscriber customers of time-sensitive events such as tornados, tsunamis, severe thunderstorms, child abductions, chemical spills, civil emergencies, and product recalls. With regard to the weather alerting capability, Velleros polls NOAA every few seconds and can send customized voice or text messages to multiple end devices such as mobile phones, land lines and computers in the form of voice calls, emails, pop ups or text messages just to mention a few. Because it’s customizable, the Velleros platform can be configured to call you and wake you in the event of eminent danger from threatening weather by ringing your mobile and/or home telephone(s).

In addition to the weather service alerts and notifications, Velleros provides community-based notification features that enable Universities and State-and-Local Governments to reliably notify their respective communities of emergency situations or other time sensitive and important information. Velleros’ alerting and notification applications are also planned to be compliant with requirements for a new capability mandated by U.S Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Commercial Mobile Alerting System (CMAS). CMAS is based on the Warning and Response Network Act (the WARN Act) legislation passed by U.S. Congress in 2006. The WARN Act seeks to leverage carrier mobile phone networks and technology to augment the current radio and television based emergency broadcast system in the United States. CMAS deployment in the U.S. is forecasted for 2009-2010 and will include four levels of alerts of which one is severe or threatening weather.

I would like to talk with you or someone at you office about how best to use the Velleros platform to protect people and property in our state. I can be reached at my Velleros email account, jwhitehurst@velleros.com or my mobile at 469-583-5227.


Best Regards,

Jay Whitehurst

Governor Easley,

My son, my daughter and my son-in-law are all members of the 30th Brigade of the NC National Guard. They have been activated and are now training in Mississippi in preparation for their tour of Iraq. My son was a Senior at East Carolina University when he was activated. My daughter was 3 classes from graduation from East Carolina University. My son-in-law was a policeman with the Greenville Police Dept. until the call. All three are proud to be serving NC and the USA.

I am proud that when called, they put their lives on hold for the next 2 years. However, I got a disturbing email from my son yesterday. He told me that he has been informed that the military will be deducting $500.00 from his already meager pay to pay for food while he trains. This disturbs me greatly. My children are putting their lives on hold and in jeopardy, and the NC National Guard is charging them for food? That is absurd. Would you look into this for me and find out why my children have to pay one fifth of their income to the NC National Guard for food? It has been my understanding that when you enlist, the service pays for food, housing and clothing. What has changed.

Thank you for looking into this for me.

Sincerely,

John Britt

I checked with my source in the Guard, and they are being paid under Title 32, which is NC pay them.  In March, they go to Title 10, which is Federal Pay.

In my opinion, who every pays you has some say as to what is happening.

Ms Gauntt,



Your e-mail to the Governor’s Office has been forwarded to me for response.  The information provided below should assist you with your questions.



Respectfully,



Captain Everett Clendenin

Public Information Officer

NC State Highway Patrol

Raleigh, NC





Questions concerning a traffic ticket issued by a N.C. State Trooper or other law enforcement officer should be directed to the <http://www.ncdistrictattorney.org/>District Attorney for the county in which the ticket was issued.

The telephone number for the District Attorney can be located in the State Government section of the local telephone directory.  To find a district attorney, <http://www.ncdistrictattorney.org/>click here.

Questions about the court date or location should be directed to the Clerk of Superior Court of the county in which the ticket was issued.  <http://www.nccourts.org/JDirectory/JDSearch.asp>Click here to access the court system's judicial directory.

The telephone number for the county clerk of court is listed in the State Government section of the local telephone directory under judicial or courts. 

Court Costs
Court costs are $110 for District Court.

Payment of fines and costs are NOT made to the officer but to the clerk of Superior Court. The clerk DOES NOT accept personal checks, only money orders or bank checks. The clerk will accept cash only when paying in person.

The Conference of Chief District Court Judges, not the officer, establishes a list of charges which may be paid without a mandatory court appearance and those which require a court appearance.

<http://www.nccourts.org/Forms/Documents/912.pdf>List of Traffic Offenses Requiring Mandatory Court Appearances

The fine entered by the officer on the back of the ticket is set by the Conference of Chief District Court Judges and not by the officer.

Failure to Appear
The Division of Motor Vehicles will revoke a person's drivers license or the right to drive on an out-of-state license if the person fails to appear in court or fails to pay the fine and costs. The revocation will remain in effect until the ticket is paid and the person goes to court.

Visitor: Ms. Beverly Gauntt

Address: PO Box 76, Hainesport, NJ 08036

Email: hayman1@eticomm.net

Subject: your state traffic court

Comment: In Dec we were traveling on in I-95 at 1:29AM and a trooper stopped us for speeding at 86 in a 70 mile zone. My daughter was driving, I was the passenger. The trooper walked up to my side, I had the insurance card and registration already out, he never asked for either. He asked us the year of the vehicle? and for my daughters license. He said you were speeding any reason why, no she was keeping up with traffic. He came back to the car and said that she must appear in court, yes we will drive 8 hrs for a ticket or you must have a traffic lawyer appear for you! Also he informed us that he couldn't tell us the amount of the fine because the cost would depend on who the judge was that day!! Since when does a ticket depend on who the judge is? Also when we got into lite to read the ticket it said that there was no other traffic, traffic was very heavy that nite!! Also the ticket gives you no phone # no address to appear. I don't understand why he didn't ask for the registration to the vehicle? The vehicle we were in is my company vehicle, how did this officer know that it wasn't stolen, because it isn't in my name or daughters. I just don't understand why we just can't pay the ticket without hiring a lawyer or coming back to N/C? Thank you, Beverly

Subject: Traffic Law Enforcement

Comment: In the spring of 2007 the sheriff of Caswell County requested through the Board of Commissioners that NCDOT conduct a traffic study due to ongoing safety issues on SR 1503 (Walters Mill Rd). NCDOT conducted the study and deemed signage was necessary. The signs were placed and now even after all this time there isn't any enforcement by either the State Hwy Patrol or the local Sheriff's Dept. The State Hwy Patrol says they can't enforce the signs that NCDOT deemed necessary and the local law enforcement says it's a state maintained road and they don't have the manpower. Who can I contact to rectify this convoluted process? I can't get my state representative to return my calls (Bill Faison). Mr. Mike Mills of the NCDOT as well as Sargeant Pearson of the SHP is aware of this particular area in Caswell County.

Advocate



Madam  Governor,



I am a member of the North Carolina National Guard. My story can be found at

www.shadowwounded.org <http://www.shadowwounded.org/> . I called it that

because Guardsmen and Reservists especially those with PTSD and MTBI are

exactly that the Shadow Wounded. My exeriance has been that Guardsmen are

just sent home and then stonewalled ignored, abandoned by the US Army? The

National Guard is not prepared, and does not have the resources to to care

for and retire these soldiers. I have been told "We cannot put you on ADOS

orders (ADSW) because of your medical conditions and associated profiles."

In laymen terms I can't get on orders because I was injured in the Line of

Duty during my deployment to a Combat Zone. This is INSANE, and I am the one

with brain damage. I have asked, begged, pleaded, and yelled for help. Madam

Governor I went to fight for this State, I gladly took the Guidon and

fought. That is not my issue, but I do believe that the State has an

obligation to the Guardsmen who on your call leave their homes and families

to help this State. I am sorry I didn't loose my leg, or my arm, and

therefore am not a hero. But i do need help none the less. I am not the only

one. I have become an advocate (just me, I do not represent any groups) for

Veterans Mental health issues. I have gone to the Legislature, and intend to

do the same this session. One of my ideas is with all the issues at DHHS and

specifically with Mental Health in the State. Would it not be a good idea to

set up an IG office similar to the military's IG system, it could also serve

as a Patient Advocate function. If nothing else it would help the PR of the

division immensely. I am not a politician, and I am not an insider, just a

Citizen/Soldier. I need help, and want to help. I respectfully request to

schedule a meeting at your convenience; it should take no more than 15 to 20

minutes to discuss the issues concerning the NC National Guard's position on

abandoning Soldiers. I am coming to you, not to circumvent the Chain of

Command, I have exhausted the Chain of Command.





Sincerely,



SGT Jonathan Lubecky

Subject: military IG complaint

Comment: I filed an IG complaint with the North Carolina Army National Guard in 2006. Requesting an investigation on the "General's" procedures for the EQRB- Enlisted Qualification Retention Board, due to my non-selection. This board is regulated for all military members with 20 or more years of service. I received a letter from the NCARNG IG's office stating the procedures would be investigated and the results would be sent to Gov. Easley's office for review and I would be contacted by the Governor's office. I have contacted the Governor's office several times with a response indicating I was non-selected. I am aware of the non-selection, but I was not given the results of the investigation procedures for the decision of non-selection. I understand according to the Army regulation that I had no right to an appeal process, that statement would be true if the guidelines for disqualification were adhere too. All regulations have to be followed by every soldier regardless of rank. I have military documentation that validates there was no reason under the guidelines that I should have been non-selected. Also that I am entitled to receive results from an IG complaint that was filed while I was on duty. I have been reminded several times that this is a lenghty process, but better than 2 years is a little extreme, seems to follow by the wayside. The former Governor's staff and the NCARNG AG & IG's office would rather not comply to the regulations. I have the documentation that was presented to the EQRB, the IG's office and the former Governor's office, I would gladly send to your office for review. I also have military documentation for the past 24 years of service that does not and has never disaqualified me as a member of the military. One example of the boards finding according to the now retired State Command Sergeant Major Tom Gattis...I was briefed that I had a back injury and was told to go to a medical review board. I had never had a back injury nor is there any documentation in my military or personal medical records that indicates a problem. He even recomended I have another physical, which I did and no disqualifying factors. If I "really" had a medical issue, the retention board would not be the deciding factor of my disqualification, my records would have been sent to a medical review board to make a decision of my medical qualification or disqualification. One of my biggest concerns is that our military program offers tens of thousands of dollar for referrals, enlistment and relistment bonuses for recruits, while the Adjutant General and staff runs the military as his own business and not according to Army regulations. Every year soldiers are disqualified with no legitimate reason while other soldiers with non-deploying medical issues remain employed as tradition M-day soldiers, military technicians and AGR soldiers. Thank you for your service and your time. I look forward to your response, Sincerely Sharon Thurston (cell-336-250-5919)

Comment: Govenor Perdue, If you would please, look into the fact of substandard meals for the Guard Troops, training at Camp Shelby in Mississippi. They have had 588.00 deducted from their pay only to be served substandard meals and running out of milk. I am very proud of my son-in-law serving his state when called to do so. I am disappointed that the state is not supporting them, as they should. Thank you, Veronica Sue Molloy

Comment: Mr. Shawn Harris 8101 Foal Ct Mint Hill, NC 28227-6549 January 9, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Purdue 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Purdue: I would like to congratulate you on your election victory. I am requesting a meeting to showcase my company's ability to increase the detection of outdoor marijuana operations with increased apprehension / arrest results at dramatically lower cost opposed to what is currently being utilized. I am quite familiar with the RAID Program, having flown with the program several years as a pilot with the NC Guard. The NC Sheriffs' Association is supportive of this meeting as well. This could represent considerable savings to the State of North Carolina by reducing the direct /indirect use of NC National Guard, State Highway Patrol, State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and local agency's aircraft and ground based manpower. I look forward to your reply. Sincerely, Shawn Harris

Subject: Tricare coverage for NC National Guardsman injured on active duty

Comment: Greetings, My name is Jessica Aguilar, my husband is a member of the NC National Guard prepareing to deploy in March for combat in OIF. We are very proud of his service for our country and the support he provides for our family. He was injured while training in GA in Dec. and has been undergoing physical therapy in MS with his unit. He has made adiquate improvement such that comand said they will green-light him if he returns home and completes the recomended 6 remaining weeks of therapy. He was originally slated to be enroled in the Wounded Warrors program at Ft.Bragg but comand opted to send him home to Hillsborough for whatever reason. I have been talking to a fantastic therapist who, given the details and documentation of his situation, has said that she sees no problem in full recovery in the time-frame required given his progress through the therapy provided in Mississippi. Everyone (comand, therapist in Miss. and here) seems to be in agreement that he is fully deployable as planned, however, comand is now saying that they are not going to put in a recomendation for Tricare coverage for the remaining portion of the physical therapy required. Tricare is our family's only source of insurance. There is no dispute that this is an active duty injury, nor is there a question of his ability to deploy provided that he conplete the required therapy, additionally he is still on active duty orders once he is here for the number of weeks needed for recovery (all paperwork is in order and has been signed by comand) the only thing lacking is the support for payment to the therapist (Select Care in Durham). Can you suggest any aid for us in this situation? I do not understand why Tricare would not be requested for an active duty injury. My husband is not the only one from his unit in this situation, there is another SPC who fell off a Bradly during an active duty training exersize and his therapy is also not being covered but he may deploy provided he complete his treatments which will not be covered by Tricare. They are both traveling home today from Mississippi. Could this be an oversite in paperwork on a company level? Please advise. Thank you for you time and attention to this matter. Please contact me if at all possible it would be a pleaseure to speak with you again (you were present at an event hosted by the Native American Student Association when I was at NC State, you managed to make time to speak breifly with each of us, that ment a lot, thank you) Respectfully, Jessica Aguilar

Dear Honorable Perdue,

There has been recent cases of staph infections (4 at least that turned
into
MRSA)in B co 1/120th CAB North Carolina National Guard training at Camp
Shelby MS for a deployment to Iraq. 3 of the MRSA cases were treated by
some
kind of surgical technique and the soldiers were confined to the
barracks
environment until the infection healed enough for them to return to
duty. In
the last MRSA case one of the soldiers had to stay in the hospital in
near
by Hattiesburg, MS for an extended period of time to recover from the
infection. Other infections have been reported by personnel who take
people
to and from the THC and hospital from other companies in the 1/120th CAB
and
the 230th that belong to the 30th Infantry Brigade from North Carolina.
Since the staph infection cases seem to be under control to a certain
extent
some commanders may not worry too much about it; Consequently, the
National
Guard units are in a bad situation since people who get the infection
stay
in a barracks environment that allows non clinical MRSA or Staph
Infection
to recycle and spread easier, which effects training since the soldiers
cannot train for days or weeks who get the infection. Have a great day!

Subject: National Guard

Comment: My husband is a member of the NC National Guard and is deployed. My husband volunteered with the 30BCT. Due to the volunteer status he should have received $50.00 more per muta in Oct and Nov 2008. IG and his chain of command are telling him that he was on a derivitaive UIC due to not having a family care plan. We have since found that they were mistaken as we told them all along and that he was not on the derivative UIC. To this date we have not received the extra $50.00 per muta for Oct and Nov 2008 nor have we received the mileage for him traveling to and from RedSprings in Nov 2008 for drill. When he asks the chain of command in his unit, he is told that they do not have time to deal with it and that he can call IG but they will not do anything about it either. This is very frustrating for us. My husband has served his country for 16 years and to be treated like this is a slap in the face. He is about to go on Federal orders on Feb. 11, 2009. He is in Mississippi now and wanted me to let you know also that the food that he is paying for is worse than what we feed our prisoners in NC. They are withdrawing money from his paycheck because they are paying him for food and then taking it back. I don't understand how our state can be so unprofessional especially when it comes to our armed forces. My husband and his fellow soldiers and their families are going through a rough transition that will only get worse and to have to deal with pay issues at the same time and for noone to care is heartbreaking and very stressful. Please feel free to contact me and I can better explain what is going on. I would appreciate anything that you can do to help.

Subject: Tricare coverage for NC National Guardsman injured on active duty

Comment: Greetings, My name is Jessica Aguilar, my husband is a member of the NC National Guard prepareing to deploy in March for combat in OIF. We are very proud of his service for our country and the support he provides for our family. He was injured while training in GA in Dec. and has been undergoing physical therapy in MS with his unit. He has made adiquate improvement such that comand said they will green-light him if he returns home and completes the recomended 6 remaining weeks of therapy. He was originally slated to be enroled in the Wounded Warrors program at Ft.Bragg but comand opted to send him home to Hillsborough for whatever reason. I have been talking to a fantastic therapist who, given the details and documentation of his situation, has said that she sees no problem in full recovery in the time-frame required given his progress through the therapy provided in Mississippi. Everyone (comand, therapist in Miss. and here) seems to be in agreement that he is fully deployable as planned, however, comand is now saying that they are not going to put in a recomendation for Tricare coverage for the remaining portion of the physical therapy required. Tricare is our family's only source of insurance. There is no dispute that this is an active duty injury, nor is there a question of his ability to deploy provided that he conplete the required therapy, additionally he is still on active duty orders once he is here for the number of weeks needed for recovery (all paperwork is in order and has been signed by comand) the only thing lacking is the support for payment to the therapist (Select Care in Durham). Can you suggest any aid for us in this situation? I do not understand why Tricare would not be requested for an active duty injury. My husband is not the only one from his unit in this situation, there is another SPC who fell off a Bradly during an active duty training exersize and his therapy is also not being covered but he may deploy provided he complete his treatments which will not be covered by Tricare. They are both traveling home today from Mississippi. Could this be an oversite in paperwork on a company level? Please advise. Thank you for you time and attention to this matter. Please contact me if at all possible it would be a pleaseure to speak with you again (you were present at an event hosted by the Native American Student Association when I was at NC State, you managed to make time to speak breifly with each of us, that ment a lot, thank you) Respectfully, Jessica Aguilar

Subject: NC ARMY NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AFFAIRS AND WELL BEING

Comment: Dear Bev Perdue: My name is Roxanne Baucom and I am the FRG leader for Delta Co. 1/120th CAB based out of Elizabethtown NC. My question is for my soldiers who are currently deployed on training missions as they prepare for their deployement to Iraq. They were recently informed that they would only get 4 days to spend with their families before they leave for Iraq. As you can imagine, they are ALL very upset and have contacted me for help. What can we do to insure these brave men and women who have given so much already, will have the right to see their families for at least 2 weeks before they leave to Iraq? Some of the soldiers are from other states or live quite a distance from Fayetteville yet they will not have time to travel, visit and say goodbye to the ones they love. Many have small children, wives and loved ones that already miss them and only ask that you step in and help them with this situation. They are only asking for 2 weeks before they go away for up to 18 months and hopefully come back safe. We are reaching out to you as your National Guard Families and Soldiers and asking you to assist us in this matter. Please call me if you have any questions and I can provide you with more details. 910-214-5922. Please also note, the families will be sending letters to you asking for you help. Kindest Regards.. Roxanne Baucom

Subject: Hurricane Flyod Awards

Comment: Dear Sir/Mam: I'm getting ready to retire from the Florida Army National Guard after 27 years of Service. I participated in the Relief Operations after the Hurricane, mainly transporting food and medical supplies to the Outer Banks and Islands, by UH60 Black Hawks. I was wondering if the State issued any Ribbons or awards to National Guard troops from other States. If so, can you provide me the information so I can send it to HRO for my Records. Respectfully Requested: SFC. Patton, Florida Army National Guard.
