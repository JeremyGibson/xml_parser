Survey: Rates for Foster Care Inadequate

By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer

Wednesday, October 3, 2007

(10-03) 04:47 PDT New York (AP) --
Most states reimburse foster parents significantly less than the actual cost of raising a foster child, complicating the task of finding good homes for children who need them, according to a first-of-its-kind survey.

The survey analyzed regional living expenses and calculated on a state-by-state basis the minimum cost of adequately raising a foster child. Only Arizona and the District of Columbia pay foster parents more than this minimum amount, according the survey.

To adequately cover the cost of rearing a foster child, base payments in 28 states would need to be raised at least 50 percent, and five states — Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin — would need to more than double their current base rates, according to report. It was compiled by the University of Maryland School of Social Work, the National Foster Parent Association, and Children's Rights, a New York-based advocacy group, for release Wednesday.

Of the more than 500,000 U.S. children in foster care at any given time, about 75 percent live with foster parents, while most of the others are placed in group homes and institutions.

The report expressed concern that inadequate reimbursement rates would worsen a shortfall of foster parents, "potentially increasing the likelihood that children will be placed in institutions or shuttled from one foster placement to another."

"The bottom line is that when these rates don't reflect the real expenses that foster parents face, it's the children who suffer," said Karen Jorgenson, executive director of the Foster Parent Association.

Although child welfare agencies are required by federal law to reimburse foster parents for the cost of raising foster children, there is no national minimum, leaving states and localities free to set their own rates. The result is a huge disparity. The base rates paid for raising a 2-year-old foster child range from $236 a month in Nebraska to $869 in the District of Columbia.

The "minimum adequate rates" in the report represented the cost of providing basic needs — housing, food, clothing, and school supplies — as well as a child's participation in normal after-school sports and activities.

The monthly rates recommended by the report, averaged out on a national basis, were $629 for 2-year-olds, $721 for 9-year-olds and $790 for 16-year-olds. Currently, the average actual monthly base rates offered by states are $488 for 2-year-olds, $509 for 9-year-olds and $568 for 16-year-olds.

While Arizona and the District of Columbia were the only jurisdictions whose base payments exceeded the recommended minimums, 10 other states fell short by only small amounts: Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.

In Nebraska, state officials had advance knowledge that the report would list it as having the lowest base rate, and the administrator of its Child Welfare Unit, Christine Hanus, sent a letter to Children's Rights expressing dismay.

Hanus noted that many Nebraska foster parents receive more than the minimum base rate, as well as extra payments for child care and other purposes. However, she acknowledged in the letter that two-thirds of the payments for foster children under 6 were at the base level of $236 a month — far below the minimum adequate rate of $636 which the report recommended for Nebraska.

In a telephone interview, Hanus said Nebraska's foster parents were meeting the needs of the children in their care.

"Foster parents do not leave because of the money or the care rates," she said.

In Missouri, Department of Social Services Director Deborah Scott noted the state recently increased subsidies to foster parents for the first time since 2001, but acknowledged the rates were still below recommended guidelines.

Julie Farber, director of policy for Children's Rights, said she hoped child welfare officials in states with low rates would use the report to press their legislatures for more funding.

In California, Farber said, the number of foster parents has been dropping, and child welfare officials already have cited inadequate reimbursement as a factor.

"They know it stands in the way of doing their job," she said.

Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children (“Foster Care MARC”)

An October study 2007 of foster care rates across the country reached the provocative conclusion that “on average, across the U.S., current foster care rates must be raised by 36 percent in order to reach the Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children (the “Foster Care MARC”). The Foster Care MARC represents the projects’ calculations on the minimum expenses involved in providing care for a child in a foster home. According the reports’ estimates “in some states, rates are less than half of what it actually costs to care for a child in foster care.

The Inadequacy of Adoption Assistance Rates

According a 2008 study by the North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC), The <http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/adoptionsubsidy.html>Value of Adoption Subsidies, “59 percent of children adopted from foster care were adopted by foster and parents and 26 percent were adopted by relatives.” Since adoption assistance rates more often than not fall below foster care rates, it is clear that adoption assistance rates are also inadequate.

<http://www.childrensrights.org/policy-projects/adoption/adoption-subsidies/>Ending The Foster Care Life Sentence, a 2006 study by Children’s Rights of New York, surveyed 250 adoptive and prospective adoptive parents from Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Texas. Children’s Rights found that 47% of the survey respondents received an adoption subsidy that was lower than the foster care rate. Thirty nine percent received the same amount of adoption assistance as foster care support and 14% received a higher level of adoption assistance, probably due to additional state funded support.

In Fiscal 2001, the median foster care rate in Ohio was $590 per month, while the median Adoption subsidy rate was $544 per month. The median adoption subsidy payment probably reflects the relatively higher levels in the larger counties such as Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Montgomery (Dayton). In many Ohio counties the median and mean adoption assistance rates are noticeably lower than $544, even in 2008. (See Understanding Adoption Subsidies:An Analysis of AFCARS Data, January 2005).

The 2008 NACAC report notes:



"Most foster families are in the low to lower middle income range,23 and many grandparents and other relatives who care for children in foster care are on fixed incomes. Without subsidies, many parents would not have the means to adopt children from foster care. Just as foster care maintenance payments do not cover the true costs involved in the basic care of a child,25
adoption subsidies are modest financial supports that provide adoptive families
with additional resources to meet their children’s needs."


It is hardly surprising that the Children’s Rights survey found:



"more than half (57%) of survey respondents who had already adopted said the subsidy amount was not sufficient to meet the child’s needs. Of those survey respondents considering adoption, 59% anticipated that the available subsidy would not be sufficient. Additionally, 7% of adoptive and prospective adoptive parents who responded that the subsidy was sufficient to meet the child’s current needs indicated uncertainty that the subsidy would be sufficient to meet
the child’s needs in the future."


The Foster Care MARC Study

The report, entitled <http://www.childrensrights.org/policy-projects/foster-care/hitting-the-marc-foster-care-reimbursement-rates/>HITTING THE M.A.R.C.; Establishing Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children, represents the joint efforts of Children’s Rights of New York in collaboration Ruth H.Young Center (RYC) for Families and Children at the University of Maryland School of Social Work and the National Foster Parent Association (NFPA). The project compared its “minimum adequate rates for foster children state foster care rates collected from April 2007 through July 2007.



According to Foster Care MARC estimates, foster care rates are inadequate to cover the food, clothing school supplies the basic expenses of caring for the child cited in federal and state laws. Noting that foster care rates do not typically rank very high among state budget priorities, the report concludes that “foster care rates in many states do not appear to be based on a real assessment of children’s basic needs.

Thus, it is no surprise that foster parents and other advocates routinely report that current rates fall far short of the actual costs of providing care. And, if foster parents are not financially able to pick up the shortfall by paying out of their own pockets for expenses that the state or locality is legally obligated to cover, then children may do without.

If the Foster Care MARC report is accurate, the study also calls the adequacy of adoption assistance rates into question, in as much as they are consistently lower than levels of support for children in foster homes. In the end, when all the warm rhetoric is expended on the value of adoption, it ranks even farther far down the list of state budget priorities, than foster care in spite of studies that claim the advantages of a permanent family over the problems encountered by young adults who age out of the foster care system. (See <http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/adoptionsubsidy.html>Value of Adoption Subsidies).

In 2007, average monthly foster care rates ranged from a low of $226 in Nebraska to $869 in the District of Columbia. Given the report’s focus on meeting the foster child’s daily care needs, the figures cited do not reflect the more specialized “difficulty of care rates” paid in support of foster children with severe special needs.

The Foster Care MARC includes the allowable expenditures in the Federal Title IV-E Foster Care Maintenance Program, food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance and travel for visitation with a child’s biological family.” The MARC methodology establishes basic foster rates for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia by:

· analyzing consumer expenditure data reflecting the costs of caring for a child;

· identifying and accounting for additional costs particular to children in foster care;

· and applying a geographic cost of living adjustment

The resulting monthly cost figures for minimum adequate levels of support cover basic daily needs as well as what the report refers to as “normalizing” activities. The report contends that sports, art and other activities “are particularly important for children who have been traumatized or isolated by their experiences of abuse and neglect and placement in foster care.”

Interestingly, adoptive parents frequently mention such programs in negotiating adoption assistance agreements with state and county agencies. Although, they clearly fall under the rubric of meeting the child’s “ordinary and special, current and anticipated needs” set forth in the federal Child Welfare Policy Manual as criteria for negotiation, agencies frequently attempt to reject the cost of “normalizing: activities and indeed of all ordinary daily expenses as unallowable expenses in deliberations concerning the amount of adoption assistance.

The Foster Care MARC cost estimates do not include the cost of travel allowing the child visits with members of the birth family or child care for working foster parents. The authors explain that “given the variability in these expenditures from case to case, states and localities should reimburse foster parents based on their actual expenditures, in addition to the Foster Care MARC.”

The report’s authors also claim that the Foster Care MARC provides superior standard to annual U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates of the costs of raising children because USDA estimates “include expenses that are not typically part of a foster care rate, such as mortgage or rent, health care and education, and they exclude other expenses particular to the care of children in foster care.” It should be noted that the USDA expense categories do apply to adoption assistance negotiations which are required to consider both the “needs of the child” and “circumstances of the family” and place no strictures on how adoptive parents determine to sue adoption assistance payments on behalf of their children.


According to the report, the national averages representing the Foster Care Marc compare with the 2007 national foster care payments as follows:
Age 2: Average Monthly MARC Rates - $629 National Monthly Foster Care Averages - $488

Age 9: Average Monthly MARC Rates - $721 National Monthly Foster Care Averages - $509

Age 16: Average Monthly MARC Rates - $790 National Monthly Foster Care Averages - $568

Based on Cost of Living estimates, the MARC Foster Care Estimates for Ohio were:

Age 2 Foster Care MARC Estimates Ohio - $635 National Monthly Foster are Averages - $488
Age 9 Foster Care MARC Estimates Ohio - $727 National Monthly Foster are Averages - $509
Age 16 Foster Care MARC Estimates Ohio - $797 National Monthly Foster are Averages - $568

Study Proposes Minimum Rates For Foster Care

Skip directly to the <file:///C:/Users/Teresa/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows%20Mail/Stationery/#content>full story.
By SHERRI ACKERMAN The Tampa Tribune

More from this channel: TAMPA - Linda Manci treks from Valrico to Plant City to buy farm-fresh produce, splitting the bounty - and cost - among friends.

Food co-ops fill the rest of the grocery list. She buys clothes for her two teenage girls at Ross Dress For Less. Help with the holidays comes by way of local charities.

The rest falls to Manci and her husband, Sam, who probably sound like typical middle-class parents making ends meet.

Except the Mancis also are foster parents, raising someone else's child.

In four years, the couple has cared for 17 foster children in addition to their own offspring. Although the state provides a monthly stipend to cover some costs, it's not nearly enough, Manci says.

After spending at least $5,000 from their own pockets each year, the Mancis let their foster care license expire last year, thinking they couldn't do it anymore.

Then they heard about a little girl who desperately wanted a home.

"After this one, no more," Manci swears.

It's a common refrain among foster parents and child welfare advocates across the country, and the impetus for a study released last week calling for minimum reimbursement rates nationwide.

Currently, each state sets its own rate, money that comes from a blend of local and federal funding. In Florida, the rate is $429 per month for children up to 5 years old, $440 per month for 6- to 12-year-olds, and $515 a month for teens 13 and older.

According to the study, known as Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children, national benchmarks should be set at $629 per month for 2-year-olds, $721 for 9-year-olds and $790 for 16-year-olds.

Florida is among the majority of states that fall below that level, the study found, with a need to raise rates by as much as 51 percent for some age groups.

Washington, D.C., which pays $940 per month for its 16-year-olds, and Arizona, which pays $879, are among the states that provide the most assistance. Ohio, which pays only $275 per month for 16-year-olds, provides the least.

The study also calculated the national averages: $488 per month for 2-year-olds, $509 for 9-year-olds and $568 per month for 16-year-olds.

"We're well below the average," acknowledged Jeff Rainey, chief executive officer of Hillsborough Kids Inc., the private agency that oversees local foster care for the state.

The Legislature approved a $2 a day increase for the 2006-07 fiscal year, the first such increase since 1999, Rainey said.

"We're grateful they raised it," he said. "But foster parents need more money."

The stipend goes toward clothing, food and shelter. But there's a lot it doesn't cover, such as baseball gloves, band uniforms, prom dresses, summer camps, movies and Busch Gardens - things that give foster children "normal" childhoods.

Manci says her foster daughter gets an additional $300 clothing allowance for the school year, but that doesn't go far. She's at a sensitive age and doesn't want secondhand clothing.

"Kids, especially teens, want top brands," said Joy Perez, president of the Hillsborough County Foster Parent Association, and foster mom to a 17-year-old girl. "They already have self-esteem issues."

Other factors aren't considered by the state, either, added Victoria Elliott, who has two foster sons and serves as president of the Suncoast Foster Parent Association. Groceries are more expensive. Gas prices fluctuate. Mortgages are rising.

The low rates hurt retention of foster homes and recruitment of foster parents, Elliott said. She supports a national minimum, but Perez said without advocates to convince lawmakers, such a plan will never work.

The Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children study was created and researched by national child advocacy groups, including Children's Rights, the University of Maryland School of Social Work and the National Foster Parent Association.

<file:///C:/content/scorecard-children%E2%80%99s-rights-hitting-marc>Scorecard: Children’s Rights & Hitting the MARC

by Hershel Sarbin
06/09/2008
<http://www.childrensrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=hittingthemarc><http://www.connectforkids.org/image/article/scorecard/marc_cover.jpg>In October 2007, Children’s Rights, the National Foster Parent Association and the University of Maryland School of Social Work released <http://www.childrensrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=hittingthemarc>Hitting the M.A.R.C.: Establishing Foster Care Minimum Adequate Rates for Children. It identified the true costs of supporting children in foster care, uncovered disparities in foster parent reimbursement rates across the country, and recommended a new standard rate for each state to meet federal requirements to provide foster parents with funds to cover children’s basic needs.

The release was groundbreaking; it was the first time these data were collected for each state across the country. But as with any important study, compiling it is only half the battle. What you do next—how you track its influence—is equally important.

Few child and youth organizations have the resources to keep score of the reach and results of their work. We asked Julie Farber, Director of Research with Children’s Rights for a “scorecard”—detailed follow-up on what has happened since the report was released. Here are those results.


The Reach of Hitting the MARC

The report was widely disseminated. Recipients included:

* Every state and county public child welfare agency across the country
* Thousands of private child welfare service provider agencies across the country
* Tens of thousands of foster parents via the National Foster Parent Association (NFPA) and state and local foster parent associations
* Members of congress
* State legislators
* Thousands of media outlets which produced coverage reaching millions of Americans
The report has been presented at multiple conferences including Child Welfare League of America, National Foster Parent Association (NFPA), the North American Council on Adoptable Children and the Foster Family Treatment Association.

Press Coverage
Hitting the MARC received tremendous press coverage; the story was featured by more than 150 print, broadcast, and online news outlets, including ABC News, The Associated Press, Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, USA Today, The Washington Post and others. The report continues to generate coverage as advocates use it in their local advocacy efforts.


Making a Difference: Advocacy Support to States

<http://www.connectforkids.org/image/article/scorecard/marc-map.jpg>Children’s Rights and NFPA are supporting states in their advocacy and also working on advocacy at the federal level with members of Congress and the Administration, along with other partners such as Child Welfare League of America, the Alliance for Children and Families and Voices for America’s Children.

In addition to making technical assistance available to all states, NFPA is providing small grants to five states to support local advocacy efforts: Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon and Massachusetts.

Selected examples of advocacy follow-up from the report include (but are not limited to) the following:

Illinois
The Child Care Association of Illinois sent letters advocating for the MARC to every state senator and state representative.

Following the release of the MARC, two bills were introduced in the state legislature: one that would provide a one-time payment of $24 million to foster parents and another that directs the state child welfare agency to either use the MARC methodology or establish a different methodology for calculating foster parent reimbursement rates.

On February 28, 2008, the bill to mandate the additional $24 million passed unanimously out of the House Appropriations Committee and will go to the full House for a vote.

The Illinois Foster and Adoptive Parent Association members are currently scheduling meetings with members of the state legislature to discuss the MARC.

Missouri
The Missouri Coalition of Children’s Agencies (MCCA) (a membership organization of providers) provided written testimony in support of the MARC to the Missouri House Appropriations committees.

Carmen Schulze of the Missouri Coalition of Children’s Agencies wrote an op-ed that appeared in the St. Louis Business Journal that discussed how Missouri needs to increase foster care rates by more than 100 percent to reach the MARC.

The Kansas City Star named foster care rates one of its "issues to watch in 2008."

The Governor's budget recommendations included a 3,000,000 increase in resources.

A "Hit the MARC" lobby event is being planned for foster parents in Jefferson City on April 14. Joint planning by Midwest Foster Care and Adoption, St Louis Foster & Adoptive Coalition, the Missouri Foster Parent Association and MCCA is ongoing to plan the event.

California
A lawsuit seeking adequate rates and citing the MARC report was filed by advocates in California the day the report came out.

Mississippi
The State of Mississippi agreed to implement the MARC rates in the settlement of Children's Rights' class action lawsuit there (a broad overall system reform lawsuit).

Oregon
The Oregon Foster Parent Association has outlined a plan whose primary purpose and objective is to educate state legislators, the Governor, the community at large and the Department of Human Services of the importance of matching or making a plan to eventually reach the MARC. The expectation is that legislation will be submitted for the 2009 legislative session.

Vermont
Hitting the MARC has been established as a priority for the next legislative session. The Vermont Foster/Adoptive Families Association is working in collaboration with state partners to identify a fair and equitable reimbursement system for foster parents.
