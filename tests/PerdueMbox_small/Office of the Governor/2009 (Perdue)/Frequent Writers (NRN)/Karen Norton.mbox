Hello everyone,



I wanted to share this with the girls in the office mostly. Please see what happened to a friend of ours last week. Please be careful as you go to any stores and come out to the parking lots. The police told Rebecca this incident may have been gang related. This is not the first of these the police have seen and believe it may be some sort of initiation gig for gangs. So please be careful and park in a place where there is a lot of activity and you could be heard or seen if needed.



Take care of yourselves.



Marvin

Hey ya'll,
I have talked to a few of you today who I wanted to update... and then thought I would just send this out to my nearest and dearest and those who know Rebecca personally.   Yesterday, my sister in law, Rebecca, who lives  in Wilmington, NC went on her usual Sunday trip to the grocery store (Lowe's Foods at Monkey Junction....a nice area of town...similar to Friendly Harris Teeter)....it was 7 ish so not midnight when she came out.  She was dressed casually (no diamond necklace and fur) ...loaded up and was getting in her car when out of nowhere a man with a knife shoved her inside....he held a knife to her throat while pushing her in and he locked the doors.  She offered her purse, her car, her wedding ring....no deal.  While holding the knife at her with his right hand.....he started the car with his left hand.  This is when she knew ....he was NOT going to let her out of the car.

At this point she started kicking him with all of her might, hitting and biting him....he took jabs at her and she tried to grab the blade of the knife....this sliced her tendons but she didn't stop and just kept kicking him in the head. At some point (which to her probably seemed like hours) he realized he messed with the wrong girl and jumped out ...fleeing across the parking lot...thank god.

She is in a 3 plus hour surgery right now due to the severity of damage in her hand. They are not sure what can be fixed and what cannot.

While I read about stories like this in the paper.....this has hit so close to home.  It seems like these days...a simple trip to the grocery store can turn into your worst nightmare...we are so very thankful that she is alive and thank God she knew to fight back!!!!

Ruin Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan: Betsy McCaughey

Commentary by Betsy McCaughey

Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Republican Senators are questioning whether President <http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Barack+Obama&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>Barack Obama’s stimulus bill contains the right mix of tax breaks and cash infusions to jump-start the economy.

Tragically, no one from either party is objecting to the health provisions slipped in without discussion. These provisions reflect the handiwork of <http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Tom+Daschle&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1>Tom Daschle, until recently the nominee to head the Health and Human Services Department.

Senators should read these provisions and vote against them because they are dangerous to your health. (Page numbers refer to <http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.+1:>H.R. 1 EH, pdf version).

The bill’s health rules will affect “every individual in the United States” (445, 454, 479). Your medical treatments will be tracked electronically by a federal system. Having electronic medical records at your fingertips, easily transferred to a hospital, is beneficial. It will help avoid duplicate tests and errors.

But the bill goes further. One new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology, will monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective. The goal is to reduce costs and “guide” your doctor’s decisions (442, 446). These provisions in the stimulus bill are virtually identical to what Daschle prescribed in his 2008 book, “<http://www.amazon.com/Critical-What-About-Health-Care-Crisis/dp/0312383010/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234118804&sr=8-1>Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis.” According to Daschle, doctors have to give up autonomy and “learn to operate less like solo practitioners.”

Keeping doctors informed of the newest medical findings is important, but enforcing uniformity goes too far.

New Penalties

Hospitals and doctors that are not “meaningful users” of the new system will face penalties.  “Meaningful user” isn’t defined in the bill. That will be left to the <http://www.hhs.gov>HHS secretary, who will be empowered to impose “more stringent measures of meaningful use over time” (511, 518, 540-541)

What penalties will deter your doctor from going beyond the electronically delivered protocols when your condition is atypical or you need an experimental treatment? The vagueness is intentional. In his book, Daschle proposed an appointed body with vast powers to make the “tough” decisions elected politicians won’t make.

The stimulus bill does that, and calls it the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (190-192). The goal, Daschle’s book explained, is to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies because they are driving up costs. He praises Europeans for being more willing to accept “hopeless diagnoses” and “forgo experimental treatments,” and he chastises Americans for expecting too much from the health-care system.

Elderly Hardest Hit

Daschle says health-care reform “will not be pain free.” Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. That means the elderly will bear the brunt.

<http://www.medicare.gov>Medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective. The stimulus bill would change that and apply a cost- effectiveness standard set by the Federal Council (464).

The Federal Council is modeled after a U.K. board discussed in Daschle’s book. This board approves or rejects treatments using a formula that divides the cost of the treatment by the number of years the patient is likely to benefit. Treatments for younger patients are more often approved than treatments for diseases that affect the elderly, such as osteoporosis.

In 2006, a U.K. health board decreed that elderly patients with macular degeneration had to wait until they went blind in one eye before they could get a costly new drug to save the other eye. It took almost three years of public protests before the board reversed its decision.

Hidden Provisions

If the Obama administration’s economic stimulus bill passes the <http://www.senate.gov>Senate in its current form, seniors in the U.S. will face similar rationing. Defenders of the system say that individuals benefit in younger years and sacrifice later.

The stimulus bill will affect every part of health care, from medical and nursing education, to how patients are treated and how much hospitals get paid. The bill allocates more funding for this bureaucracy than for the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force combined (90-92, 174-177, 181).

Hiding health legislation in a stimulus bill is intentional. Daschle supported the Clinton administration’s health-care overhaul in 1994, and attributed its failure to debate and delay. A year ago, Daschle wrote that the next president should act quickly before critics mount an opposition. “If that means attaching a health-care plan to the federal budget, so be it,” he said. “The issue is too important to be stalled by Senate protocol.”

More Scrutiny Needed

On Friday, President Obama called it “inexcusable and irresponsible” for senators to delay passing the stimulus bill. In truth, this bill needs more scrutiny.

The health-care industry is the largest employer in the U.S. It produces almost 17 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. Yet the bill treats health care the way European governments do: as a cost problem instead of a growth industry. Imagine limiting growth and innovation in the electronics or auto industry during this downturn. This stimulus is dangerous to your health and the economy.

Obama's Leninism

Ed Kaitz
Vladimir Lenin coined the term “Democratic Centralism” in order to describe what he considered to be Bolshevik “bipartisanship.”  In his famous book What Is To Be Done? Lenin worried that left to themselves, the proletariat would never achieve the kind of “revolutionary consciousness” required to overthrow the capitalist system.  Therefore a “vanguard” of socialist intellectuals like Lenin and Trotsky were needed in order to instill the proper “consciousness” into the mentally challenged masses.

“Democratic Centralism” was Lenin’s way of insuring that individuals within the Bolshevik party could “openly” and “democratically” discuss proposals that came down from the intellectual vanguard.  The “centralism” however insured that once a decision was made by “consensus” there could be no deviating from the party line during the implementation of the particular proposal.

In time, “Democratic Centralism” came to mean what everything eventually meant in Lenin’s universe: my way or the highway.  “Bipartisanship” for example meant discussing different viewpoints within the party as long as they didn’t reflect “bourgeois consciousness.”  In short, Lenin, like President Obama it seems, claimed “I won” and would only entertain a certain “politically correct” form of bipartisanship.

Obama’s recent frustrations and impatience over the “Stimulus Bill” have less to do with his claims of “catastrophe” and “crisis” and much more, it seems to me, to do with his breathtaking inexperience in a true marketplace of ideas.  And just where was Obama supposed to learn how to debate?  In liberal academia?  From his “adversarial” minions in the press? Community organizing?

The Founding Fathers divided the American government against itself so that, according to James Madison, “ambition is made to check ambition.”  The purpose was to preserve our freedom and make it impossible for leaders to frighten and manipulate the citizens into accepting rash and precipitous proposals.  The cost may be a certain clumsiness in reacting to pressing social issues, but the benefit is twofold: a healthy debate from each branch of government, and the knowledge that the Constitution remains the final arbiter, not fallible men who claim “I won.”

Just as government officials had feared, the drug violence raging in Mexico is spilling over into the United States. U.S. authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings and home invasions connected to Mexico's murderous cartels. And to some policymakers' surprise, much of the violence is happening not in towns along the border, where it was assumed the bloodshed would spread...

Flint, Mich. - The mayor of Flint, Mich., has resigned just weeks before he was to face a recall election over his representation of the struggling city's finances. Mayor Don Williamson said Monday he was retiring for health reasons including kidney stones and sinus infections. The 75-year-old Democrat (Snip) The Feb. 24 recall stemmed from claims Williamson mismanaged city funds and violated the public trust by misrepresenting the city's finances.

A high-risk, 18-year-old sex offender in North Carolina may soon be a free man — because he is an illegal immigrant and the state has determined it cannot pay to put him in a treatment facility.

The Guatemalan man, identified only as "D.G," was convicted of raping his 5-year-old handicapped cousin when he was 15. Despite recommendations by criminal psychologists that he be sent to a sex-offender treatment program, he wound up in a youth detention center instead.

But D.G. can stay in the center only until his 19th birthday — and with that day approaching, what happens next is anyone's guess.

D.G.’s attorney, Ann Petersen, said the case didn't always seem so complicated.

"When he was originally adjudicated in 2005, the trial judge took into account all of the expert psychological examinations and his background and determined that there was a program that was well suited for him through a private agency," Petersen told FOXNews.com.

"He was sent off in September and doing great in the program until the county decided they didn’t want to pay for it."

In February of 2006, a motion for review was filed stating that "funds were no longer available" for D.G.'s placement. A notice from the local mental health agency, Foothills Area Program, soon followed, saying the $128,000-a-year services being provided to him would be terminated effective March 31, 2006.

"The court decided that it couldn’t force the state or county to pay for it because there’s this statute that says that for illegal aliens no government agency should be forced to pay a benefit," Petersen explained.

With no public funds available for D.G.’s treatment, the court moved him to a youth development center, where he could remain in custody only until he turned 19.

"It’s not a treatment center, it’s a jail," Petersen said of the facility. "He couldn’t get treatment for sexual deviance there, which is what he needed."

D.G. appealed the ruling, but a court determined that under federal law, he was not a "qualified alien" — and thus the state could not provide funding for him to receive "custodial sex offender treatment," court documents show.

On Feb. 23, Petersen will take D.G.'s case to the North Carolina Supreme Court and argue again that D.G. should be committed to treatment. If her appeal is unsuccessful, D.G. will be released, from the development center untreated.

But exactly when that will happen is unclear.

D.G. cannot be kept in the center past his 19th birthday, but Petersen said she doesn't know when his birthday is and, considering illegal immigrants often have faulty documents, it's possible even the state doesn't know for sure.

The even bigger mystery is where he will go when he is released.

The court has established that D.G. can’t return to his family's house in North Carolina, as his victim lives there. But beyond that, little is known about where he will end up.

Petersen said she doesn't know what will happen or whether the federal government will deport D.G. The district attorney, when contacted by FOXNews.com, declined to comment on the case.

An immigration attorney, Erena Baybik, is surprised D.G. isn’t already back in Guatemala.

"Since in most cases, a sex crime is deemed an aggravated felony under immigration law, the alien would be automatically deported because there is no defense to aggravated felonies under immigration law," Baybick told FOXNews.com. "I am a bit surprised at all of the bureaucratic hoops that the government is having to go through in North Carolina in order to find a resolution to this case."

But Cheryl David, the the national chairman of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said deporting D.G. might not be that simple.

"Since it's a youthful offender adjudication, he might not even be deportable at all," she said.

Former Immigration and Naturalization Service Special Agent Michael Cutler said the idea of keeping D.G. in the country is deplorable.

"The bottom line is he committed a heinous crime and he poses a threat to people in the community where he lives, and I don't think the United States has a burden to keep mentally incompetent or criminally insane people in this country when they don't belong here," Cutler told FOXNews.com.

"He may need help, but there are children in America who aren't getting the proper education that they need to help them with a variety of issues either.... If you can't feed your own children, you don't invite more people to the dinner table."

Whether D.G. stays in the U.S. or is sent back to Guatemala, former federal prosecutor and immigration attorney Michael Wildes said he will still be a threat to children, and American money will have been wasted.

"This is a lose-lose for everybody, including taxpayers who are going to end up having to pay for care that isn’t going to change the defendant," Wildes, currently the mayor of Englewood, N.J., told FOXNews.com. "Simply put, an individual with this problem should be treated."

And at this point, that might be easier said than done.

"By pulling him out of treatment he was sent the message that he was wrong to trust the program and the providers, and this could have further damaged him," forensic psychiatrist Dr. Hans Stelmach told FOXNews.com. "It might be tough to re-engage him in the program."

But all that considered, Stelmach said, he would still recommend that D.G. return to a treatment program.

Petersen said even if help is out of reach for D.G., it's not out of reach for others.

"It’s kind of a peculiar case because the appellate process takes so long that by the time we get this resolved, unfortunately, it may or may not be too late for him," she said. "But hopefully his case will prevent this from happening to someone else."

Koch: Democrats using 'stealth' to re-engineer society with 'stimulus' package

By Ed Koch

Those in power under former president George W. Bush contributed to the economic rape of the country by declining to regulate Wall Street, allowing the economic debacle now unfolding which has devastated the country, bringing middle-class Americans to their knees economically with their jobs and savings vanishing with each passing day.    <javascript:void(0)>ShareThis


In the last days of the Bush tenure, his economic team tried to stem the economic tidal wave overwhelming the country with a team led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson who failed miserably. Bush’s team told us that the major problem was liquidity and that a bailout of the banks was absolutely necessary; otherwise the country would collapse into a great depression similar to that which ushered in the FDR administration. When the Congress which had rejected the first Paulson plan reversed itself out of sheer terror and voted for the $750 billion bailout, we found that six weeks later, Paulson was telling us buying the “toxic assets” of banks was no longer the way to go and instead we should give these banks more dollars to shore up their capital, which he did using half of the $750 billion that had been approved by the Congress for the bailout to secure liquidity. The man who we thought knew what to do gave those billions away without conditions and the banks chose to date not to lend, and instead buy other banks, pay dividends to shareholders and bonuses to their top executives and others who led them to failure.

The new team under President Obama has asked the Congress for an additional so-called stimulus bill, now at about $800 billion and still growing — with about $350 billion remaining and available to the Obama administration for use from the prior stimulus package. The administration has the power now or through laws that Congress could pass to make the banks lend and provide the needed liquidity. When I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on October 9, 2008 and asked why he didn’t impose a requirement that the banks do their job to lend for which they were licensed — and only to those applicants who were creditworthy and at the same rate as the prior year, his response was, “…requiring directly that banks extend specified amounts of credit to creditworthy borrowers would entail many complications. For example, bank regulators would need to create an objective definition for determining which borrowers were creditworthy. Moreover, because the volume of banks’ credit activities can fluctuate over time for a variety of reasons, including those over which they have no control (such as the rate of economic growth in their geographical regions), determining appropriate targets for individual banks’ lending activities would be complex and potentially arbitrary. In addition, because of the very large number of banking institutions in the country — more than 8,000 — administering such a program would be extremely resource intensive.”

Do Bernanke’s objections make sense? Aren’t those 8,000 banks monitored now? Let me suggest to the Obama administration how they should react to the current economic crisis:

1. Impose by executive order a requirement that all banks fulfill their obligations and <http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_politics0097_02_03.asp>lend money to creditworthy applicants. If the Obama administration does not believe it has the power to impose that requirement, then ask Congress for that power and in the interim, make it a condition of any loan program entered into by the banks under future bailouts.

2. Create a new court or use existing bankruptcy courts with the power to change the terms of mortgages. I suggest new courts as well as using the existing <http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_politics0097_02_03.asp>bankruptcy structure in order to avoid the need for bankruptcy on the part of the mortgagor because of the predatory lending practices used in the original mortgage. The New York Times editorial of February 2, 2009 states, the Obama administration has rejected the “bankruptcy fix” now “out of fear it would cause Republicans to delay or reject the package.” If true, this is unbelievably foolish on the part of the administration.

Finally, I am fearful that radicals in the Democratic Party who support programs such as healthcare and education reform that I have supported over the years will seek to impose those programs by fiat without Congressional hearings and laws, by inserting them in the stimulus legislation. On what do I base that fear? Here are two news reports.

A January 28, 2009 New York Times article by Robert Pear stated, “The stimulus bill working its way through Congress is not just a package of spending increases and tax cuts intended to jolt the nation out of <http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_politics0097_02_03.asp>recession. For Democrats, it is also a tool for rewriting the social contract with the poor, the uninsured and the unemployed, in ways they have long yearned to do. With little notice and no public hearings, House Democrats would create a temporary new entitlement allowing workers getting unemployment checks to qualify for Medicaid, the heath program for low-income people. Spouses and children could also receive benefits, no matter how much money the family had. In addition, the stimulus package would offer a hefty subsidy to help laid-off workers retain the same health plans they had from their former employers. Altogether, the economic recovery bill would speed $127 billion over the next two and a half years to individuals and states for health care alone, a fact that has Republicans fuming that the stimulus package is a back door to universal health coverage…As Congress rushes to inject cash into a listless economy, it is setting aside many of the restraints that have checked new domestic spending for more than a decade. The White House said the changes contemplated by Congress would provide coverage for nearly 8.5 million newly uninsured people who had lost their jobs and would protect Medicaid for many more whose eligibility would otherwise be at risk.”

On the same day, January 28th, a New York Times article by Sam Dillon reported, “The economic stimulus plan that Congress has scheduled for a vote on Wednesday would shower the nation’s school districts, child care centers and university campuses with $150 billion in new federal spending, a vast two-year <http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_politics0097_02_03.asp>investment that would more than double the Department of Education’s current <http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2009/ss_politics0097_02_03.asp>budget. The proposed emergency expenditures on nearly every realm of education, including school renovation, special education, Head Start and grants to needy college students, would amount to the largest increase in federal aid since Washington began to spend significantly on education after World War II. Critics and supporters alike said that by its sheer scope, the measure could profoundly change the federal government’s role in education, which has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local government.”

While I support the ultimate goals of the new Democratic congressional majority for significant changes in our society, I do not want those changes imposed through stealth. I want them debated and voted on by a Congress able to sort out the good from the bad in shaping legislation. That is not what is happening now. According to Pear’s New York Times article, “Democrats said the current economic crisis did not allow time for public hearings on the legislation.” For me, this is a form of tyranny and is not acceptable. The ends here do not justify the means. There is no need or excuse for stealth.   <http://buzz.yahoo.com/article/pub/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.worldtribune.com%252Fworldtribune%252FWTARC%252F2009%252Fss_politics0097_02_03.asp>

If Violence Escalates in Mexico, Texas Officials Plan to Be Ready

Thursday , February 12, 2009

By Joshua Rhett Miller

As drug cartels continue to terrorize Mexico, Texas officials are planning for the worst-case scenario: how to respond if the violence spills over the border, and what to do if thousands of Mexicans seek refuge in the United States.

Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, said a multi-agency contingency plan is being developed, and it will focus primarily on law enforcement issues, including how to handle an influx of Mexicans fleeing violence.

"At this point, what we're focusing on is spillover violence," Cesinger told FOXNews.com Thursday. "The immediate concern, if any, would be that."

More than 5,300 people were killed in Mexico last year in connection to criminal activity, and some experts predict things will get worse. Along with Pakistan, Mexico was identified in a Department of Defense report last year as a country that could destabilize rapidly.

If that were to happen, officials are concerned that the drug violence could cross the Rio Grande into southern Texas.

Cesinger said the plan currently does not address a potential flood of refugees, though "It may be something that comes into consideration."

"Worst-case scenario, Mexico becomes the Western hemisphere's equivalent of Somalia, with mass violence, mass chaos," said Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "That would clearly require a military response from the United States."

Carpenter, who recently authored a study entitled "Troubled Neighbor: Mexico's Drug Violence Poses a Threat to the United States," said Mexican government could collapse, although it's unlikely.

"That's still a relative longshot, but it's not out of the question," Carpenter said. "It's obviously prudent for all of the states along the U.S.-Mexican border and the military to consider that possibility and not get blindsided should it happen."

Some lawmakers in Texas have begun questioning how to deal with a potentially massive influx of Mexican citizens.

"Do you strengthen the borders so people cannot get in by the thousands every day, or do you create detention centers where people are held until their status is determined?" asked state Sen. Dan Patrick. "This is a potential refugee problem..."

"Let's pray that this does not develop in Mexico," Patrick told FOXNews.com. "However, when you hear the president of the United States cast dire warnings on our country, that even our financial system could collapse, it makes you think. If the United States can face catastrophe, obviously Mexico could as well.

"We have to seriously consider that as a remote possibility, so therefore, we need to have a plan."

Patrick called upon Texas Homeland Security Director Steve McGraw to present a comprehensive plan to the state's Legislature.

McGraw, who reportedly told lawmakers at a recent border security meeting that fears of Mexico's collapse were "well-grounded," was unavailable to comment Thursday, Cesinger said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff indicated last month that the continuing violence has prompted plans for civilian and military law enforcement should it spread into the United States.

Chertoff said the plan calls for armored vehicles, aircraft and teams of personnel along border hotspots. Military forces, however, would be summoned only if civilian agencies like the Border Patrol were unable to control the violence, the New York Times reported.

DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said the department began developing the plan last summer to address a "broad spectrum of contingencies that could occur" if the violence escalates.

"This violence is happening because the [Felipe] Calderon administration is doing the right thing by cracking down on powerful drug cartels," Kudwa said in a statement. "The cartels are, predictably, fighting back to protect their lucrative criminal livelihood. This plan doesn’t change or otherwise supersede existing authorities; it plans for how a number of government organizations would respond and coordinate if local resources were to be overwhelmed."

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is "continuing to develop that plan," Kudwa said Thursday.

Meanwhile, Tim Irwin, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said he was unaware of any plans in Texas to prepare for an influx of Mexicans seeking refuge. Theoretically, Irwin said, a Mexican citizen could go to a border crossing and seek asylum based on fears of returning home amid the ongoing drug wars.

"It's a valid claim to make, but you'd need to back that up," Irwin said. "That would start the process."

Irwin said the individual would be initially detained and given a "credible fear interview" to determine if his or her concerns are valid. If so, they could be eventually be released into the United States.

But Carpenter said the worst-case scenario — a "sudden surge" of up to 1 million refugees in addition to the hundreds of thousands who enter illegally each year — would be daunting.

"That would be very difficult to handle," Carpenter told FOXNews.com. "I suspect what'd you see fairly soon is an attempt to seal the border as much as possible. That would probably be the initial response, along with the building of additional facilities [to detain the Mexican refugees]. But nobody wants to see that happen."

Under the plan Obama is expected to sign into law early this week, states will divide $27 billion to build and repair roads and bridges. That is less than half the $64 billion in projects states told the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials late last year that they had ready to go.

The law also requires that half the money be spent on projects that have been vetted by the federal government and deemed "ready to go" in 120 days, as a way to jolt the economy and create jobs. That means state officials are under pressure to make decisions quickly on which projects to fund and which to bypass.

A President Who Needs Misery












































·                                  










 By Bruce Walker  Thursday, February 19, 2009



Do Barack Obama and the Democrat Party want prosperity?  There is no reason to suspect that they do.  The highest priority for them has always been raw political power.  As the endless scandals of modern politics reveal, if one has political power then one also has wealth. 

During the awful decades in which Stalin ruled the Soviet Empire, many people noted that “Citizen Stalin” did not have great personal, but he also had almost unlimited power and so whatever he wanted, he got.

Democrats are, more than anything else, power junkies.  The morals of society, the welfare of others, the hopes of posterity – all these mean nothing next to the pure political power of right now.

The normal assumption is that political parties that create prosperity win political power, but that is not an entirely accurate assumption.  FDR gained more political power when the nation careened into deeper dependence, deeper poverty, and deeper debt.  His biggest electoral victory was in 1936, when the Great Depression was at its worst and when Roosevelt and his Democrats had totally dominated American politics. 

If the poor, the desperate, and the hopeless look to political champions for their salvation, then the votes of the poor will go to those champions.  The cold logic of electoral politics means that Obama, like FDR, wins more votes the greater the number of poor people in America.  Consider the history of the last century.

During the first decade of the Twentieth Century, the American economy was growing fast.  The Model T entered production.  Motion pictures began to appear.  Telephones were becoming commonplace.  The age of innovation, the age of migration with sharp upward mobility, the age of American ascendancy in the global economy – all these things – began. 
Which political party controlled the White House?  McKinley was re-elected by a landslide in 1900.  Teddy Roosevelt won election, after succeeding the assassinated McKinley, by a greater landslide in 1904.  William Howard Taft followed T.R. by a landslide in 1908.  Republicans, outside the Jim Crow and Ku Klux Klan Democrat South, were overwhelmingly the majority party.  Then Woodrow Wilson, Leftist and bigot supreme, brought the Democrats back to power.  The nation struggled.  We entered a war in Europe which had no connection to our national interests or our moral principles.  After the war, the nation slumped into a Democrat recession. 

Then American entered the “Roaring Twenties.” Prosperity returned.  The economy expanded.  What was politically connected to this economic affluence?  Republicans won a huge landslide in 1920 with Harding.  There was another huge Republican landslide in 1924 with Coolidge.  Hoover – hardly a Republican (he, like Eisenhower and like Colin Powell, had been recruited by both political parties) – won the presidency in 1928.  The Democrats regained power in 1932…because of the Great Depression.

Over the next seven lean years, American suffered but Democrats grew fat.  The misery and hopelessness of ordinary Americans translated into mind-numbing Democrat victories, like in 1936, when Alf Landon carried only Maine and Vermont against FDR.  The deeper the economy slumped, the higher the stock of the Democrat Party rose.  “Tax and tax.  Spend and spend.  Elect and elect” DNC Chairman Farley put it at the time.  Or, he might have said “The worse, the better.”

Democrats, like all other socialists, follow closely the maxim:  “The worse, the better.”

After the war ended, Democrats suffered a sharp reverse in 1946.  Republicans were swept into control of both houses of Congress as the stringency of wartime rationing ended and the natural liberty and productivity of Americans blossomed.  This grew into a full blown post-war recovery during the 1950s (much maligned by Leftists as a time of careful middle class comfort) and into a Republican dominated decade. 

The pattern is largely the same.  The economic downturn and energy crisis of the 1970s led to a resurgent Democrat Party.  The confidence and prosperity of the 1980s was coupled with a strong Republican Party led by Ronald Reagan.  When Americans grew poorer, Democrats grew fatter.  When Americans gained personal wealth, like in the 1990s, Democrats became the minority party.

Democrats, like all other socialists, follow closely the maxim:  “The worse, the better.” All this may explain the odd behavior of Barack Obama, the taking down of the economy, the apparent indifference to the horrific corruption which dizzies the minds of investors – prosperity is the enemy, not the friend, of Barack Obama. 

What if, for example, the Stimulus Package worked?  What would happen if the GDP rose eight percent next year?  What if unemployment dropped dramatically and home ownership rose dramatically?  What if tens of millions of Americans had income increases which pushed them into higher tax brackets?  Well, many tens of millions of Americans would rejoice.
But what would Democrats do?  Lower taxes would become a hot political issue again.  Punishing corporations would become political suicide if millions of Americans re-entered the stock market.  Unemployment compensation, subprime mortgages, and welfare benefits would become political albatrosses instead of marks of electoral nobility.

The bottom line is simple:  one political party feasts on the carcasses of rotting economic flesh and another political party does best when the nation does best.  Does Barack Obama want the Stimulus Package to bring prosperity?  Well, one must ask:  does Obama want the Republican domination of the first decade of the Twentieth Century or of the “Roaring Twenties” or of the 1950s or of the Reagan 1980s to return?  He poses as FDR, the President of Misery.  For Obama, the worse, the more desperate, the more hopeless we become, the better for him.

Anyone who actually works and pays taxes is going to pull back on every spending item. Sell their houses and hunker down.

People who have spent three generations getting to this point are not going down without a fight against their achievements built on the sacrifices of their grandparents and parents. 



Environmentalists are hurting the poor, women and children by forcing energy into high priced vehicles.

Cities are spending money on ART and not the poor.

Tax and spend liberals are hurting the poor, women and children by forcing more and more people into poverty.

Environmentalists and liberals are not telling the poor, women and children that their policies are raising the price of food they need for their families.

They are not telling the poor, women and children that they may never be able to own their own home because of the manipulation by government at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused this precipitous fall into a catastrophic financial crisis that they are going to continue to make worse by bleeding dry the people who pay taxes.

Schwarzenegger presided over the creation of a budget deficit worse than the one that led to his ousting of Democratic governor Gray Davis in 2003. The state has a $42-billion deficit that state legislators have been holding all-night sessions to try to patch over and that sent Schwarzenegger begging to Washington for a bailout. The state has been buffeted by the housing crisis, but the ultimate cause of the mess is relentless, heedless overspending.

California has roughly doubled its budget during the past ten years — like the recently passed stimulus bill, except spread out over a decade. Over five years, Gray Davis boosted spending from $75 billion to more than $100 billion, and his “fiscally conservative” vanquisher got it north of $140 billion. Davis managed to keep spending even during the devastating dot-com bust, and Schwarzenegger’s election brought only the briefest respite on the inexorable upward climb.

The politicians aren’t entirely to blame, although at every sign of the unsustainability of the state’s fiscal practices their reaction has been to resort to more gimmicks and borrowing. California’s voters have recourse to an initiative process they have used to make responsible budgeting as hard as possible. They passed a proposition in the late 1980s that basically locked up half of state spending for the schools, no matter what. Even in November, with fiscal disaster looming, they passed another $10 billion in bonds for high-speed rail, apparently on the theory that a state can never have enough debt.

The new budget deal will cut about $15 billion in spending and raise roughly the same in taxes, including the car tax over which Schwarzenegger pounded Davis in 2003. The deal has its worthy provisions, but fundamentally it is more of the same. California will remain overtaxed, overregulated, and overburdened by a public sector that is the state’s sole boom industry.

Schwarzenegger spoke movingly during his first campaign for governor of what California meant to him, of its dynamism that fostered entrepreneurial dreams. That California is disappearing. Schwarzenegger now governs the Michigan of the West. California has the fourth-highest state unemployment rate in the nation and is routinely ranked among the worst states in its business environment. Almost 1.5 million more nonimmigrants have left the state than moved to it during the past ten years.

Once, Schwarzenegger was supposed to be a model for a more appealing, more moderate Republican Party — socially liberal, yet fiscally conservative. All he has demonstrated is, to paraphrase Barry Goldwater, that moderation on the road to fiscal ruin is no virtue. The GOP’s social liberals are overwhelmingly fiscal liberals, too — witness the party’s social liberals in the Senate signing off on the stimulus bill, liberalism’s proudest fiscal accomplishment since the 1970s. As for the Governator, he said hasta la vista long ago.

Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending

By STEVEN A. HOLMES

In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.

The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets -- including the New York metropolitan region -- will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.

Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.

In addition, banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to so-called subprime borrowers. These borrowers whose incomes, credit ratings and savings are not good enough to qualify for conventional loans, can only get loans from finance companies that charge much higher interest rates -- anywhere from three to four percentage points higher than conventional loans.

''Fannie Mae has expanded home ownership for millions of families in the 1990's by reducing down payment requirements,'' said Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive officer. ''Yet there remain too many borrowers whose credit is just a notch below what our underwriting has required who have been relegated to paying significantly higher mortgage rates in the so-called subprime market.''

Demographic information on these borrowers is sketchy. But at least one study indicates that 18 percent of the loans in the subprime market went to black borrowers, compared to 5 per cent of loans in the conventional loan market.

In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.

''From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,'' said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ''If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.''

Under Fannie Mae's pilot program, consumers who qualify can secure a mortgage with an interest rate one percentage point above that of a conventional, 30-year fixed rate mortgage of less than $240,000 -- a rate that currently averages about 7.76 per cent. If the borrower makes his or her monthly payments on time for two years, the one percentage point premium is dropped.

Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, does not lend money directly to consumers. Instead, it purchases loans that banks make on what is called the secondary market. By expanding the type of loans that it will buy, Fannie Mae is hoping to spur banks to make more loans to people with less-than-stellar credit ratings.

Fannie Mae officials stress that the new mortgages will be extended to all potential borrowers who can qualify for a mortgage. But they add that the move is intended in part to increase the number of minority and low income home owners who tend to have worse credit ratings than non-Hispanic whites.

Home ownership has, in fact, exploded among minorities during the economic boom of the 1990's. The number of mortgages extended to Hispanic applicants jumped by 87.2 per cent from 1993 to 1998, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. During that same period the number of African Americans who got mortgages to buy a home increased by 71.9 per cent and the number of Asian Americans by 46.3 per cent.

In contrast, the number of non-Hispanic whites who received loans for homes increased by 31.2 per cent.

Despite these gains, home ownership rates for minorities continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites, in part because blacks and Hispanics in particular tend to have on average worse credit ratings.

In July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed that by the year 2001, 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low and moderate-income borrowers. Last year, 44 percent of the loans Fannie Mae purchased were from these groups.

The change in policy also comes at the same time that HUD is investigating allegations of racial discrimination in the automated underwriting systems used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to determine the credit-worthiness of credit applicants.

But, if the White House kills the supplemental outright, that means it will actually be spending about $70 billion less for defense next year.

A big defense cut is a big problem. Unlike previous wars, the US military never mobilized for this one. During the Cold War, the Navy had 567 ships; today it has 283. The Air Force has about half as many wings. On 9/11, the Army had 10 divisions - down from 18.

The terror war started with a smaller peacetime force and it was fought on a peacetime budget, so there is no "peace dividend" to be had.

Anyway, a "peace dividend" presumes a peace - and, while Iraq may be calming down, the president intends to boost our commitment in Afghanistan

New Era, Old Story

Sec. Gates Overturns Dover Ban Without Consulting Military Families









Dear Military Families United Member and Supporter,

As many of you already know, Defense Secretary Robert Gates today announced that the current ban on the media photographing the transfer cases ceremony at Dover Air Force Base has been overturned. We at Military Families United are disappointed with this decision because we feel that the families of the fallen heroes were not consulted prior to announcing this unnecessary change in policy. Despite  Sec. Gates saying that he received “input from a number of sources, including all of the military services and the organizations representing military families,” Military Families United, the largest military family organization, was not contacted or consulted. To read the Military Families United press statement about this <http://www.votervoice.net/link/clickthrough/ext/31718.aspx>click here

John Ellsworth, President of Military Families United, sent the following letter to Secretary Gates tonight.

Dear Secretary Gates:

Let me begin by thanking you for your service and your leadership for this country. I am a Gold Star father, and am painfully aware of the sacrifices that you have made and the tremendous successes that you have achieved with the surge in Iraq. With your leadership and guidance you have played a crucial role in fostering Iraq as a more stable and secure ally in the Middle East.

However, as the President of Military Families United, I am disappointed in your recent actions during your review process of the Dover AFB media ban at the transfer cases ceremony. At your press conference today you said that to make your decision to overturn this ban you received “input from a number of sources, including all of the military services and the organizations representing military families.”

As the nation’s leading military families organization, we are wondering why we were not consulted before your decision was announced today. We represent the largest number of military families around this nation, including those whose family members have paid the ultimate sacrifice for this country. If you did not consult with the largest military family organization, who did you speak to you?

Last week, Families United asked our military families to tell us how they feel about the possibility of  the media ban being overturned. We heard from nearly a thousand families and the overwhelming majority, more than 85%, told us not to overturn the ban.  We heard from mothers terrified that their fallen hero would be used as political propaganda; from fathers who didn’t want to have to answer media questions as they watched their son come home; and from parents who wanted their solemn moment to remain private and far from the media lenses. We would have been happy to share these responses with you and play a role in your decision making process, but unfortunately that was not an option presented to us.

You have been an unwavering advocate for America’s military families and we know your heart aches with every fallen hero and their family. This is why this decision, and the “review process” that apparently advised it, was so out of character. We respectfully ask that as you form the task force to answer the many unresolved issues surrounding your decision, that you allow us a seat at the table. We would also like to know what military family organizations you consulted to make your decision to reverse the ban? We are America’s military families and our voices deserve to be heard.


Sincerely,


John Ellsworth
Proud Father of Lance Corporal Justin Ellsworth (KIA 11/13/04)

Senate Rejects Fairness Doctrine, But Dems ‘Open Back Door to Censorship’
Friday, February 27, 2009
By Susan Jones, Senior Editor



The Senate passed a Broadcaster Freedom Amendment to a D.C. voting rights bill on Thursday by a vote of 87-11. But Democrats countered with an amendment that seeks to promote “diversity” in media ownership.

The Broadcaster Freedom Amendment prevents the Federal Communications Commission from reinstating the Fairness Doctrine, which would requires equal time for the expression of different political viewpoints on the public airwaves. Radio stations that run conservative talks shows, for example, would be required to allot equal time for liberal talk shows – or, more likely, stop airing the conservative shows altogether.

Critics of the Fairness Doctrine call it an assault on free speech. They say the government has no business deciding what constitutes fair political discourse.

On Thursday, Republican supporters of the Broadcaster Freedom Amendment said its passage “slammed the front door” on the Fairness Doctrine. But they admit their fight for free speech is not over.

The Senate on Thursday also passed an amendment by Sen. Dick Durban (D-Ill.) that seeks to achieve the same goals of the Fairness Doctrine through backdoor FCC regulations, Republican critics say.

Durbin’s amendment requires the FCC to “take actions to encourage and promote diversity in communication media ownership." Republicans view the “diversity” call as an attempt to muzzle successful syndicated radio programs. They  say the Durbin amendment would hurt small, local radio stations that depend on popular syndicated programming for listeners and revenue.

The Durbin amendment passed 57-41; no Republican supported it.

“Senator Durbin’s amendment exposed Democrat intentions to impose radio censorship through the back door, using vague regulations dealing with media ownership,” said Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.). “Senator Durbin’s language was so broad, it could apply beyond radio to television, newspapers and the Internet. All eyes are now on the FCC. If they attempt to shut down free speech indirectly, we will fight to stop them,” DeMint added.

“It was reassuring to see the Senate stand up for free speech today,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). “However, I am troubled that as we killed the ‘Fairness Doctrine,’ Senator Durbin’s amendment brought to life a new threat to talk radio and other arenas of free speech. Senator DeMint and I, along with others, will continue to stand up to efforts to limit the expression of differing opinions and free speech on talk radio, TV, and the Internet,” said Thune.

Sen. James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) hailed the bipartisan vote in support of the Broadcaster Freedom Act. “Today is a tremendous victory for free speech and the First Amendment, and while I am sure liberals will continue to look for another way to attack conservative radio, I will be standing with my colleagues to ensure that doesn’t happen,” Inhofe said.

Acting FCC Chairman Michael Copps says he doesn’t support the return of the Fairness Doctrine, but he does think government has a role in enforcing media “diversity.” That role includes re-examining licensing and other regulations for radio stations -- including AM stations dominated by talk radio -- to make them “more reflective” of public interests.

The fight over the Fairness Doctrine is "yesterday’s fight,” Copps said. But he also stressed the need to make radio broadcasts more “reflective” of the public interest.

If people can’t be evicted from houses they can’t pay for then why should people have to pay for their cars.

Why have contracts at all if they are to be negated by judges?

There will be no credit and it will be a cash only black market society.

Tax credit will not change taxes owed.  If you take the $13. a month tax credit, it will be additional income that will be taxed next year.  Therefore there is no tax cut because the rate won’t change and you will pay back the 13. in taxes next year.



Of course if you don’t pay taxes anyway it’s a payout in welfare to those who don’t pay taxes.



Of course this doesn’t include the:

Carbon tax

Gas Tax

Water Fees

Electricity Fees

Food Price Hikes

Etc

Etc

Etc



Yes we can tax everyone and call it something else.

Obama uses the media as his guillotine. If you are “rich” you get your head chopped off on TV.

Washington - Even President Obama’s budget chief doesn’t know how much it will eventually cost to enact the president’s vision of health-care reform. (Snip) Orszag described the $634 billion the administration built into the new budget over the next 10 years -- as a ''down payment'' for health reform. The former head of the Congressional Budget Office would only say that ''more'' money will be necessary as the administration works with Congress

So now we know if you don’t like what the Obama administration says, they are coming after you.  Watch out folks because once they knock off their enemies they are coming after you to step inline. Personal Freedom no longer exists. Dissent is NOT allowed.  What’s next a personal oath to Obama?

Obama's withdrawal plan would take U.S. forces in Iraq down from a current 142,000 troops to 35,000 to 50,000. Under the status of forces agreement between the U.S. and Iran, negotiated and signed last year by the Bush administration, all forces must be out of Iraq by the end of 2011.

In short, though President Obama will get credit, it was Bush's plan — not Obama's.

The Obama administration's move to rescind broad new job protections for health workers who refuse to provide care they find objectionable triggered an immediate political storm yesterday, underscoring the difficulties the president faces in his effort to find common ground on anything related to the explosive issue of abortion. The administration's plans, revealed quietly with a terse posting on a federal Web site, unleashed a flood of heated reaction (You bet it did!)

Obama’s Hypocrisy On Iraq Success

Remember, we were supposed to ignore Mr. Obama’s stunning lack of experience because he has such excellent “judgment.”

Well, he was wrong about the surge. And his choice of a Vice President was not too stellar either.

So where have we ever seen any evidence of this alleged sound judgment?

RE: Wolf interviewing the pathetic looking "Budget" director.   We are college educated folks out here Wolf.  Where are the questions??  If the economy is going to improve by the end of this year the why were we told this was an economic "CATASTROPHE" worse than the great depression?  If the projections that the GDP will improve by 3%, 4% 4% then why did we need a TRILLION DOLLAR stimulus?  Don't these questions even occur to you Mr. Blitzer?  Aren't you supposed to be a professional interviewer?  Your skills seem to be mystifyingly lacking or you lack the minimum level of simple curiosity.

 This is supposed to be the worst economic situation of our lifetimes and it will be over by the fall of this year??
