Erase my grandfather's name at Yad Vashem

To the President of the State of Israel and the Director of the Yad Vashem Memorial

By Jean-Moïse Braitberg

February 23, 2009 "<http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/01/28/effacez-le-nom-de-mon-grand-pere-a-yad-vashem_1147635_3232.html>Le Monde" -- Mr. President of the State of Israel, I am writing to you to intervene with the appropriate authorities to withdraw, from the Yad Vashem memorial dedicated to the memory of Jewish victims of Nazism, the name of my grandfather, Moshe Brajtberg, gassed at Treblinka in 1943, and those of other members of my who family died during deportation to various Nazi camps during World War II. I ask you to honor my request, Mr. Chairman, because what took place in Gaza, and more generally, the injustices to the Arab people of Palestine for sixty years, disqualifies Israel to be the center of the memory of the harm done to Jews, and thus to all humanity.

You see, since my childhood, I lived in amongst survivors of the death camps. I saw the numbers tattooed on their arms, I heard the story of torture; I knew the impossible grief and I shared their nightmares. I was taught that these crimes must never happen again, that never again must man, because of ethnicity or religion despise other man, mock his Human Rights of living a safe, dignified life, without barriers, and hope, so remote be it, of a future of peace and prosperity.

Yet Mr. President, I note that despite dozens of resolutions adopted by the international community, despite the glaring evidence of the injustices done to the Palestinian people since 1948, despite the hopes raised in Oslo, and despite the recognition of the right of Israeli Jews to live in peace and security, repeatedly reaffirmed by the Palestinian Authority, the only answers given by successive governments of your country have been violence, bloodshed, confinement, incessant controls, colonization, deprivations.

You’ll tell me Mr. President, that Israel has the right to defend itself against people launching rockets into Israel, or suicide bombers that destroy innocent Israeli lives. My response to that is that my humanism doesn’t vary according to the nationality of the victims.

Yet you, Mr. President, you lead the destiny of a country which claims not only to represent the Jews as a whole, but also the memory of those who were victims of Nazism. This is what concerns me and that I find unacceptable.

By displaying the names of my family members at the Yad Vashem Memorial, in the heart of the state of Israel, your state imprisons my family memories behind the barbed wires of zionism, and makes it hostage of a so-called moral authority which commits every day the abomination of denying justice.

So, please, remove the name of my grandfather from the shrine dedicated to cruelty against Jews so that it no longer justifies the injustice being done to the Palestinians.

Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my respectful consideration.

A Message to Israel:

Time to Stop Playing the Victim Role

By Philip Slater

February 23, 2009 "<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-slater/a-message-to-israel-time_b_155978.html>Huffington Post" -- Jan. 09, 2009 -- I can understand that after centuries of persecution it's satisfying for a Jewish state to be the aggressor for a change, but there's a codicil that goes with that role. You don't get to act like a victim any more. "Poor little Israel" just sounds silly when you're the dominant power in the Middle East. When you've invaded several of your neighbors, bombed and defeated them in combat, occupied their land, and taken their homes away from them, it's time to stop acting oppressed. Yes, Arab states deny your right to exist, threaten to drive you into the sea, and all the rest of their futile, helpless rhetoric. The fact is, you have the upper hand and they don't. You have sophisticated arms and they don't. You have nuclear weapons and they don't. So stop pretending to be pathetic. It doesn't play well in Peoria.

(Yes, I know, we Americans should talk--always trembling in our boots about terrorists and 'rogue states' and 'evil empires' when we have enough nukes to blow up entire continents, and spend more on arms in an hour than most of the world's nations spend in a year. But just because we're hypocrites and Nervous Nellies doesn't mean you have to be).

Calling Hamas the 'aggressor' is undignified. The Gaza strip is little more than a large Israeli concentration camp, in which Palestinians are attacked at will, starved of food, fuel, energy--even deprived of hospital supplies. They cannot come and go freely, and have to build tunnels to smuggle in the necessities of life. It would be difficult to have any respect for them if they didn't fire a few rockets back.

The Israel lobby has a hissy fit when anyone points out that Israel has been borrowing liberally from the Nazi playbook, but to punish a whole nation for the attacks of a few--which Israel has been doing consistently in Gaza--is a violation of international law--a law enacted in response to the Nazi practice. And please, spare us the hypocrisy--borrowed, I'm ashamed to admit, from my own government--of saying 'every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties'. When you drop bombs on a crowded city you're bombing civilians. Bombs don't ask for ID cards. Bombs are civilian killers. That's what they do. They're designed to break the spirit of a nation by slaughtering families. They were used all through World War II by all sides for that very purpose. And that's what they're intended for in Gaza.

And please, Israel, try to restrain yourself from using that ridiculous argument, borrowed again from Bush (how low can you get?), that Hamas leaders "hide among civilians", by living in their own homes. Apparently, in the thinking of Israelis, they should all run out into an uninhabited area somewhere (try to find one in Gaza), surround themselves with flares and write in the sand with a stick, "Here I am!"

Yesterday you shelled three UN-run schools, killing several dozen children and adults, despite the fact that the UN had given you the precise coordinates of all its schools in Gaza. So much for 'taking every care to avoid civilian casualties'. You seem to feel you can kill whomever you like, whenever you like, and wherever you like, just because you have a blank check from the United States. Every day this assault goes on you're demonstrating contempt for the UN, the international community, and human life. Talk about a rogue state.

You might also pay attention to the fact that your outdated policy of macho bullying--the policy you've been following for decades--isn't working! The Palestinians are human. They're not dogs you can beat into submission. The worse you treat them, the more they'll fight back. That's what it means to be human. The more you oppress people, the more people resist. We dropped more bombs on Viet Nam than all the bombs dropped by all nations in World War II. Not to mention napalm, herbicides and all kinds of sophisticated land mines. But did they bow down and kiss the feet of their conquerors? They did not.

You'll have to kill them all. And when you do, you may finally lose the support even of the United States.

Remember that American support is based entirely on the notion that no politician can win without the Jewish vote. But not all American Jews think Israel is on a divine mission from God. A great many American Jews believe in international law and justice.

I can understand how Israel could resent this lecture coming from an American. After all, isn't this what we Americans did? Came into someone else's country, slaughtered 95% of its inhabitants and took over? And didn't we go all Nervous Nellie whenever they fought back, accusing them of aggression to justify even more genocidal slaughter? And didn't we get away with it?

Yes, but I'm sorry to tell you, Israel, you came on the scene too late. Genocide just doesn't fly any more. I know it isn't fair, you have every right to feel aggrieved about this, but the world's smaller, cowboys are passé, and bullies aren't heroes any more.

The Problem with “A nation of Cowards”
By Bill Noxid 

February 23, 2009 "<http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/>Information Clearing House" -- The most disturbing consequence of the election of the first African-American president is the delusional rush to pretend that this country that was founded ( and continues to function ) on genocide and slavery, is somehow “past” racism.  Obviously, nothing could be further from the truth, and the fact that society as a whole still refuses to face it is - as Attorney General Eric Holder stated clearly - nothing less than cowardice.   Just Google “<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Coons+in+the+White+House&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enMX313MX313&ie=UTF-8>Coons in the White House” if you need an example of just how “far” we haven’t come. 

If you need another example, watch the response of the “typical white man” that is Pat Buchanan when faced with such reality.  I would gladly point to another perpetrator of archaic racist fear, deflection, and denial, but MSNBC doesn’t seem to have any other representatives.  The fact that Buchanan is on from 6am ( Morning Joe ) to 6pm ( Hardball - which airs again 7-8pm ), makes the perspective they wish to represent and enforce continuously and unavoidably evident. 



If his tirade sounds familiar, it certainly should.  It’s the same argument people like him having been using since the days of slavery to instill fear in the white populous and justify their inhuman treatment of black people.  It’s the same argument that Pat Buchanan used in the <http://buchanan.org/blog/2008/03/pjb-a-brief-for-whitey/>Brief for Whitey he wrote when his fears of a black president began to come true: 

“America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known.” 

“We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude?” 

“Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America? Is it really white America’s fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?” 

“As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?” 

“Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?”  <http://buchanan.org/blog/2008/03/pjb-a-brief-for-whitey/>http://buchanan.org/blog/2008/03/pjb-a-brief-for-whitey/ 

The nature of these preposterous statements exemplifies the various hurtles encountered when trying to have any kind of rational conversation about race in this country.  Anyone who has boiled their perception of an entire race down to some fake statistics - undoubtedly supplied by some white power website - has rendered himself incapable of having a reality-based conversation. 

Take the 3% of crimes committed by whites against blacks “statistic.”  It’s almost impossible to state the absurdity of that statement.  Clearly the brain-trust who made that calculation doesn’t consider the murder of two million Iraqi’s, or the genocide of 100 million Native Americans to “found” ( or take ) this country, crimes of any sort. 

Clearly the mathematical genius that has determined that “black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common” thinks that occupying virtually all of the countries on the planet ( intentionally killing their leaders, teachers, doctors, and men of fighting age, poisoning their environment, stealing their resources, moving Globo-Corps slave facilities to their lands, and paying whoever is left a dollar a day to make our computers and sneakers ) is not considered theft of any kind. 

Likewise, the historian that points to the opportunity presented to 600,000 ( another ridiculous number ) Africans by kidnapping them from their own lands so they could reach “the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known,” is obviously overlooking the evidence of the oldest recognizable monarchy in human history ( preceding the rise of the earliest Egyptian kings by several generations ) that was discovered in artifacts from ancient Nubia in 1979.  A New York Times article published March 1st of that year chronicles the event.<http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/DocBen/GGJames/OnGGJamesNewsArticle.html>1,<http://www.whenweruled.com/articles.php?lng=en&pg=31>2   Artifacts mind you that were largely destroyed, in order to erase them from historical existence. 

But of course, people like this are not interested in any kind of conversation that represents reality on this planet, and that is out of necessity.  If they were to look at this planet in any light other than through the prism of the American flag  they would have to face what this country has done ( and continues to do ), and the history it had to necessarily erase in order to remain in imperial control of this planet. If the true history were actually known, the slaves would no longer consider themselves inferior and the psychological chains that bind them to servitude would no longer exist. 

So let’s talk about this country in the vacuum that they are used to then.  Isn’t is just the height of white arrogance to think that after centuries of slavery and oppression that continues to this very minute, blacks should somehow “get over it” and be content to remain the underclass?  Pose no disruption whatsoever to the white man’s farcical “law abiding” society? 

Because, as I’m sure we can all agree, if the situation was reversed and Nubians were in control of society ( enslaving and oppressing white people, being sure to “bomb them back to the stone age” from time to time ) white people would surely submit to black rule without any resistance at all, right?  If the Palestinian and Israeli situations were reversed, we would expect the Israelis to renounce violence and acknowledge Palestine’s right to exist, right? 

Sure…  Infinitely more likely everything would be on fire, irradiated, and almost everybody would be dead or dying.  Just like it usually ends up anyway when the “white man” shows up in your land… Whether you are at war with him or not.  Just ask our “allies” in Afghanistan and Pakistan for example. 

And yes, in fact white society is eminently culpable for “the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America” in more ways than one can count.  Perhaps Pat missed the news last week of the two judges, Mark A. Ciavarella Jr. and Michael T. Conahan, who pleaded guilty in Scranton, Pa., for taking more than $2.6 million in kickbacks to send poor and minority teenagers to two privately run youth detention centers - run by PA Child Care and a sister company, Western PA Child Care.<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/us/14judge.html?_r=1&ref=us>3,<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/us/21judge.html>4   

Perhaps he is unaware of the news last week that Blacks and Latinos make up about 80% of the people stopped and questioned by NYPD.  It would seem to me that would greatly increase the “odds” of black people going to jail as opposed to the 15% percent of whites stopped.<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/01/15/2009-01-15_blacks_and_latinos_make_up_about_80_stop.html>5   

Or maybe he didn’t catch the cell phone footage of 22 year old Oscar Grant being shot in the back while face-down on the subway platform ( effectively executed in front of horrified passengers ), leaving another one of those fatherless children they are quick to complain about having to support.<http://www.ktvu.com/news/18412851/detail.html#->6   The list of “grievances” goes on, and on, and on… 

I won’t dissect the rest of the lunacy, but you get the idea.  These people have to believe in utter nonsense to justify their behavior and having any kind of “conversation” about it threatens their false reality.  Hence the perpetual rage in response to any hint of truth or history.  Pat wants you to believe these methods are new, isolated, or unique in this country, but in reality he is calling us all blithering idiots that have no right to knowledge or freedom.  He knows very well that this is modus operandi in these United States, and has been from inception.  This is the discussion that cowardice prevents.

> SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGES  
> 
> It does not matter if you personally like or dislike President Obama.  We need to sign this petition and flood his e-mail box with e-mails that tell him that, even if the House passes this bill, he needs to veto it.  It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone.  If the government gives benefits to 'illegal' aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have paid into Social Security all our working lives?
> 
> As stated below, the Senate voted this week to allow 'illegal' aliens access to Social Security benefits.
> Attached is an opportunity to sign a petition that requires citizenship for eligibility to that social service.
> 
> Instructions are below.  If you don't forward the petition and just stop it, we will lose all these names.
> 
> If you do not want to sign it, please just forward it to everyone you know.
> 
> Thank you!
> 
> To add your name, click on 'forward'.  Address it to all of your email correspondents, add your name to the list and send it on.
> 
> When the petition hits 1,000, send it to <mailto:comment@whitehouse.gov>comment@whitehouse.gov
> 
> PETITION for President Obama:
> 
> Dear Mr. President:
> We, the undersigned, protest the bill that the Senate voted on recently which would allow illegal aliens to access our Social Security.  We demand that you and all Congressional representatives require citizenship as a pre-requisite for social services in the UNITED STATES.
> 
> We further demand that there not be any amnesty given to illegal aliens, NO free services, no funding, no payments to and for illegal immigrants.

Exclusive: The Iraqi Resistance Responds to President Obama

Rafidan
The Political Committee
Baghdad
The Republic of Iraq

Statement in Response to President Obama’s Remarks made on the 27th or February 2009 regarding the proclaimed ending to the occupation of The Republic of Iraq.

 Official English Transcript Release No: 57

March 02, 2009 "<http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/>Information Clearing House" --

Good Evening,  

In Respect to the remarks of President Barak Hussain Obama, The president of the United States of America. The Political Committee of a number of factions in the Iraqi Resistance, mainly the factions present in our front, respond with our point of view on the contents of his speech. 

Over the last four months, as the battle of our people continues to free Iraq of all foreign occupation. We have been studying the movements on the ground as well as analyzing the intelligence in order to assess the next strategy that the US administration will take under the leadership of the new presidency.  

We had formulated our own plan of action based on the above mentioned, but have chosen to give the new president enough time to gather his thoughts and have a suitable amount of reports & briefings that would give him also a good picture of the daily developments on the ground.  

President Obama, After listening to your speech on the 27th of February 2009, in which you declared your general and public understanding of the ongoing war against our people, and gave your military and the honorable people of the United States brief points on your intentions in our country, we felt the spirit of the speech that your predecessor President JFK gave on the 20th of January 1961, on his inaugural address. In this speech, he offered a turbulent world, a way out of tensions and paid with his own blood for challenging the interests of those in your consecutive governments who hold the true keys to power. Those who would do anything to preserve their interests, wealth, & power to create wars & conflict.  

We mention this with great honesty in hope to spread awareness and remembrance that a new Caesar may be betrayed, by his own, if he chooses to follow a different path. We do believe, on the other hand, that the spirit of the speech was well chosen.  

We have listened well to your economic plans for your country released before this speech as well, and as ambitious as it may seem, we believe that if intentions are genuine within your congress, a considerable number of  what you seek will eventually be fulfilled, but in case of failure, the republicans will be looking for a scapegoat to relate all their failures to. In this case it would be your administration. This will guarantee them a fast comeback.  

You have inherited a nation at war, a failed economy, and a desperate people who are bearing the full brunt of an economic crisis that was not of their making. As well as thousands of young men dead and handicapped.  

We have inherited a foreign occupation, endless counts of innocent dead, injured, and handicapped, millions of refugees, in essence, Mr. President, the complete and planned disintegration of our nation and people.  

We believe that the funds wasted in this war would have been more useful if it were spent on research to develop alternative energy, which no doubt would have reduced energy conflicts, cures for cancer, agricultural solutions to prevent worldwide poverty, advancements to develop Africa, where people still die of starvation and intentional neglect. Endless causes, all in need of immediate attention. 

By the will of God almighty, the resilience of our men, and the patience of our humble people, we have so far managed to halt and render useless all imperialist agendas set for Iraq and the region in whole. Simply by choosing to resist occupation, a right guaranteed by God first and then by international conventions to all men. A right your country’s policies continue to disrespect and dishonor, in clear example to state sponsored Terrorism.  

You have spoken to our people in part of your speech, and we thank you for these words, you have displayed a far better understanding our nation, than your predecessor, who preferred to dive deep into the oceans of illiteracy and ignorance. Despite the fact that you did not mention the Iraqi resistance in your speech, and chose to label us as terrorists along with those who arrived with your troops, we will set that aside for now, and mention a few facts for the record. 

1-     The people of Iraq whom you addressed, in all their sects colors and religions, refuse your occupation, and those who accept it, are those who benefit from it.

2-     The Iraqis you addressed, as we truly hope, are not the ones who bathe in the riches of treason, behind your walls of the green zone, nor are they the likes of Ahmed Al Chalabi, whom your previous government conspired with and his likes from the dark alleys of 5 star hotels in the US and Europe prior to your occupation.

3-     The Iraqi people you talked to, are those who never invited your occupation, and were trying their best to survive on what was possible, under the criminal sanctions that went on for 13 years only to be crowned with a foreign occupation, unmatched in criminal acts, in today’s modern world.



President Obama, The suffering, that our people had to go through is beyond comprehension. And the endless crimes of your troops as well as that of neighboring countries, cannot simply be undone or dismissed, nor can they be brushed under the carpet. Your troops still occupy the land and kill the innocent, that is why we can only address you as the president of an occupying nation.   

The Iraqi People are disappointed in your plan. They expect your troops to leave our country in full and not in part. Our people, seek a complete end of occupation and not the fulfillment of a strategic treaty that was rushed against the will of our people, in the last few days of your predecessor.  

Our people, as well as the majority of people around the world, and in your country, want to see the last president be presented to an international war crime tribunal for all the crimes he has committed in the name of your country, only to benefit those who brought him to power in the first place. 

We have never invited your occupation, nor have we asked your country to steal our country’s resources to benefit your corporations and to those neighboring states which historically fall under your influence. We have never asked you for your precious blood or ours, to us, all blood is precious even that of the your soldiers sent by your government to die not knowing what they were truly fighting for. This has to be addressed to the man who started this war, and is hiding now in Texas, while you try to undo his damage.  

We the Iraqi People and their resistance demand the following: 

1-     The fulfillment of all the conditions presented to your government through the mediators you

Sent in 2006.

2-     The hand over of all the traitors & Collaborators in the green zone to the Iraqi people where  

      They will be dealt with as any nation would do with in cases of high treason. 

3-     The full & just compensation for our people for the losses they have suffered.

4-     The halting of all compensations paid to those who fall under your umbrella in the region from the resources of our people.

5-     The return of all land stolen from our country.

6-     The departure of all foreign corporations mainly in the sectors of energy, communication, & infrastructure rebuilding, specifically those linked to Neocon interests. Our people are more than qualified to rebuild and operate our institutions.

7-     The hand over of all mercenaries accused of killing innocent civilians mainly security contractors in Black Water and their CEO to be tried for murder.

8-     All foreign advisors are to leave Iraq with your troops. 

9-     The dismantling of all militias equipped by your country and Iran together to shift the nature of battle towards the sectarian nature in order to allow your troops to concentrate on the major resistance activities in the central region of Iraq.   

10-  The halting of all support to the sectarian government elected in the orchestrated elections in the green zone.

11-  The reduction of the influence of your Persian allies in Iraq which your previous government worked with in close conjunction and who continue to fund Al Qaeda on behalf of  your intelligence agency’s behalf.

12-  The return to the old constitution of a unified Iraq. And the Upholding of new elections

             Within 6 months of the resistance taking power of the nation, this will be supervised,

             By must be conducted in the presence of a number of credible international monitors. Not the ones

             Sponsored by the CIA.

13-  Cities and provinces are to be handed over one by one starting with the four main cities and airports of  Baghdad, Basra, then Mosul and Kirkuk in the same order. The rest will fall immediately in our hands. The borders will have other arrangements.  

The list goes on, but the intention is to give you an idea of what we pledged our people to achieve. In return for our people’s demands, we will cease to attack all occupation forces withdrawing to the south and beyond the border post of Safwan.   

Without these straightforward moves on your part, we regret to inform you that the resistance of the people of Iraq will continue until that last boot of US/British/Persian occupation is thrown across the borders of our country.  

If you choose change as you claim, then you must have reached the conclusion that to continue dealing with the same people your predecessor appointed to fulfill his dirty work, will fail to deliver positive results for both our people. It is not the thieves of the green zone who brought the defeat of your military.  

You must search further for the honest Iraqis and from the ranks of our people and not those of your collaborators to achieve a  just solution. You can also recognize the right for the Iraqi people to resist and publicly ask for our advice and representation. The Iraqi people intend to be masters of their own house as they always have, and by following the plan you have declared, you have not yet fully understood Iraq well. 

There are those who will claim, that a quick  withdrawal from Iraq will cause civil war, and that is a possibility, but we would also like to clarify that the forces of the puppet government which has been equipped to defeat the resistance will not stand ground, nor will they block our efforts to liberate our cities one by one if we had to, and all the efforts of your collaborators to move to the north and south of the country and create their own federal states have been studied well for their weaknesses and will be crushed within a short period. This is a more realistic scenario. True there will be still the Persian occupation which will offer it’s militias support, but we know that the US cannot leave the oil rich south to be occupied by Iran, and they would rather see it fall in our hands instead. As it would be giving too much to a close yet not so trust worthy ally, and would deprive your military necessary funds that would support long-term military presence necessary in Iraq and throughout the region. Funds that  some in your government think they can still rely on. Funds that your economy can no longer bear in the midst of the turmoil in the globalized economy of your nation, to control the world.   

The Iraqi resistance understands well that the US could not continue to sell oil at a high price

of 120 USD/Barrel to cover the costs of it’s war, as this strengthens old adversaries. And it would be only a matter of time before this tactic backfires on the US foreign policy. But it also understands that the US cannot fund foreign occupation any more without depending on local resources and revenues to cover the expenses. This is the true cause of the change of “Strategy” as you named it President Obama. 

With oil prices falling to their true realistic market values, & the winter ending in the consuming economies, the oil prices should fall to 30 USD plus mark, which is also effecting the local economies of your allies in the region, as anything below 55 USD per barrel, is already becoming a burden on these economies, which in turn can no longer assist to their full potential in funding and supporting the costs of US aggression in the Region.  

The Declining of oil revenues, which we truly thank you for mentioning in your speech, will make it more difficult to fund your military’s operations in Iraq, and that is why the numbers of your troops is to be reduced. To match the income predicted from the oil projects sponsored by your corporations in the south and the oil theft operations run by your agent, Hamid Jaffar in the north of Iraq in collaboration with NGO oil of Norway, is what your strategists think is possible.  

Yes President Obama, we do agree with you, that the US needs a smarter, more sustainable & comprehensive approach, but rest assured, that what your predecessor has failed to achieve with all the military might at his disposal, we will make sure that you will fail to achieve the same goals through the soft hand of the Democratic party.  

In fact, it is more logical and practical to follow the alternative energy programs that you have set wisely, to ensure the non reliance of your economy on oil as well as the utilization of  advancements and added fruits of R&D to employ the unemployed, and support a new and young market for the shift in energy dependence, and in turn end the monopolization of energy, practiced by the corporations that control it and control world political and social stability, than to merely dream of  expecting the Iraqi People to hand you over their resources.  

We on the other hand intend to nationalize and use our resources to build an alternative energy base our selves and offer our people a life of prosperity, & stability, as well as supporting the energy transition of other nations that are oil dependant, a task we truly believe is noble and worthwhile.  

The Iraqi Resistance will not accept any short term or long term energy contracts with the US until we ensure that the rights of our people are properly addressed. And within the parameters of relations based on mutual respect first and mutual interests second.  

President Obama, It is time that people in Washington understand that there are no shared interest between an occupying tyrant and an oppressed victim of occupation.  

Your government would have stayed forever in Iraq if the traitors who conspired with your consecutive administrations had their way in starving the Iraqi people into submission and force them to welcome your occupying troops with flowers as Chalabi promised you. But after three wars and over a decade of sanctions, there were enough honest men to defeat the world’s most powerful army & play a major role in destroying the most imperialistic Globalized economy ever developed by expansionary capitalism.  

These are the type of people you are speaking to Mr. Obama. And if you were not presented with this reality throughout the briefings that occurred, and understood the true scale of the economic disaster with all the social and geopolitical  implications of your military defeat in Iraq, then please allow us to mention a few of the major achievements that the Iraqi Resistance have promised it’s people and the free people of the world and has delivered: 

1-     We promised to pin down your troops in Iraq and drain your economy until you admit defeat and withdraw your troops. And this we fulfilled. 

2-     We promised to halt the US plan for Middle East in full, and prevent the loss of other innocent lives in other neighboring countries, and that we fulfilled.   

3-     We embraced the war and continue the fight on behalf of all the oppressed world, which not only stood still and watched the massacre of our people and the illegal occupation of our nation, but many of it’s leaders participated and continue in harming our people inside and outside Iraq and assist in the theft of our resources. This, apart from the support of honest people all around the world, 

4-     including citizens of your country, who marched day and night to support the cause of Iraq’s right to resist, marches that defied the weather, and weathered criminal defiance and ignorance of world politicians. Marches that we will ever be indebt to, and in gratitude & in appreciation for. May god bless those people wherever they are.  And this we fulfilled and continue to do so. 

5-     We have understood the nature of international balances of power and most importantly predicted the primitive mind of the occupation and played a major role in forcing the US to increase oil prices in clear desperation for cash. And use that to allow other powers to recover. And the numbers never lied, this we also fulfilled. 

6-     The Iraqi People wrote a new chapter in Urban warfare, and invented the art of remote combat, and in turn gave the world lessons and set a new standard in how to defeat the world’s most powerful army. In this, the most dangerous achievement that threatens US global influence is that all the oppressed people who suffer from negative US influence, can use this experience to free themselves as well. This also has been delivered.  

7-     The Resistance has already drafted its 2, 5 and 10 year plan to engage Iraq in rebuilding programs that will set a new standard for development in the Region and restore Iraq to it’s rightfully earned place in world politics and positive human development. This while maintaining Iraq’s isolation from harmful neighboring countries at the same time, these plans was prepared and drafted in the early months of 2007 and are ready to implement once we see the end of your occupation.   

8-     The resistance created a new battle field and utilized every tool available to break free of the corporate media and tell, inform, and educate the world of the true nature of the struggle, and present every curious man and woman daily reports and videos of your military’s defeat and in every language possible. People from all over the world, chose out of their own free will and time, people of different religions and backgrounds chose to be soldiers  of the cyber wars and translated all what we had to tell, asking nothing in return but the truth. The true casualties of your war are yet to be declared. (We refer to the green card soldiers)  

9-     The resistance has sparked not only the collapse of the US economy, but also caused the domino effect and the destruction of your fine tuned and delicate Globalized economy, and forced the return to national economic protection, and the rights of local and regional economies to grow and ensure a decent life and practice their right to develop as well.  All your efforts to restore the globalized economy  will deliver nothing of value, and puppet governments that maintain your oversight of world resources will eventually fall, one after the other, as their faults will be more evident to their average citizens, and that is why you are now receiving daily reports, from the CIA about the world economy.  

ALL THE ABOVE, AND YOU STILL CHOOSE TO IGNORE THE RESISTANCE OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND THE RESISTANCE OF THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE OF THE FREE, WHICH WE INTENT TO PROPOSE TO THE WORLD AS THE NEXT STAGE OF FREEING THE PLANET FROM YOUR DOMINENCE WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.  

ALL THIS SAID, AND THE GLOBAL MEDIA WHICH YOU STILL MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER STILL LABELS FREE PEOPLE AS TERRORISTS AND EQUALS THE RESISTANCE OF OCCUPATION WITH CRIMINAL ACTS OF STRIKING CIVILIANS IN BUILDING AND TERRORISING THE LIVES OF THE INNOCENT.  

TRULY IRONIC !! Nevertheless represents the true state of shock you policy makers have reached. But all can be reversed if you truly believe in Change Mr. President.  

The resistance along with the votes of the peace loving people in your country and choice of the world

Who brought you to power, are more than capable to pull you down and defeat your new strategy, if you choose to lie to them and follow the plans of your predecessor.   

You must understand that the time when your foreign policy bullied and bribed people into submission is over and for a considerable time. And your politicians and strategists have to understand that to be accepted as a superpower you must first learn to speak to the world with modesty and respect that others in this planet, also have the right to provide for their families a decent life, the right to food and water, the right to education and knowledge, the right to industry and employment, and free from your corporate despotism.  

We in the Iraqi resistance, renew our pledge to our people and to our brothers and sisters in the global family, to continue the fight and struggle to free Iraq and give our allies the chance to follow suite.  

While you were preparing your new strategy in leaving the streets and highways of Iraq to your collaborators, and hiding your troops behind the walls of the castles and green zones you have prepared for your minimized long term presence, we have been preparing to address your new tactics and will deal with them in the proper manner. 

 Remember, that hiding behind and holding castles is no longer sustainable in modern warfare!   

Your finest fighting force as you name it, is up against the most witty, resilient & innovative self-propelled resistance honorable humanity has ever presented. Rest assured that we are not impressed with your plan and will follow your movements on the ground and cross examine them to your declared intentions and daily economic reports. There is no such thing as friendly occupation, and we advise you to revise your plans to vacate Iraq at a time suitable for our people and not suitable for your agents in the green zone.  

And if you need to talk to honest Iraqis, then you know very well, where to find them. John F Kennedy also said “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate”  

You choose to negotiate with all the parties that worked for your predecessor and have caused all this harm, yet you choose to ignore the only true party that can offer you a decent outcome. 

Good Luck President Obama!

Cowboy Ethics and Cowboy Values
By Patrick Dorinson
Political Commentator
When it comes to analyzing America’s current economic woes and how we got here, I have heard just about all the whining, navel-gazing, excuses, television talk show psychobabble, hand wringing and pundit puffery I can stomach. This is not just about lost home value or diminished 401(K)s.
In all my born days I have never witnessed a spectacle quite as ridiculous as this. America is on the psychiatrist’s couch looking for a cure to a self-inflicted problem.
All the so-called experts who are spouting all this nonsense are looking at Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme or A-rod’s “everybody was doing it” steroid defense, or Senator Chris Dodd’s laughable claim that he had no idea he was getting special treatment on his multiple mortgages and trying to divine what it all means.
Hell I’ll tell you what it all means. It means that all three and many more out there that don’t make headlines have no moral compass and that lying, stealing and cheating are OK as long as, one you don’t get caught and two, you can go on television and sheepishly apologize.
The real societal disease that has crippled us for decades — and will continue to as long as we excuse bad behavior and allow half-hearted apologies to explain it away –0 is the utter collapse of values and ethics in America.
And until we address this problem all the bailouts and stimulus packages won’t amount to a hill of beans and in a few years we will be right back in the same spot.
The cure for this disease is not more group therapy. It is as simple and as old as America itself and it still lives in the hearts and minds of the most iconic figure in our history-the American cowboy.
For all you tenderfoots and high buttoned shoe Easterners let me try to explain.
Unlike politicians and our current crop of business “leaders”, a cowboy still makes a deal with a handshake and his word is his bond. A cowboy does not make rash decisions because the wrong decision can be the difference between life and death for him, his horse and those he works with.
And a cowboy lives by a code-a set of unwritten principles that no one has to teach him because it is instilled in him at birth. Cowboys don’t whine and stomp their feet like spoiled children as some people seem to do when the going gets tough.
A few years ago I found a book that changed my life. It reminded me that even if I lost everything I had worked for I would still have my code to lean on and start all over again. I remember learning these principles from my late mother who spent a good portion of her childhood living and working with cowboys on a ranch in Colorado. The words might have been different, but she and my Dad hard wired these life lessons into me and my three brothers and sister.
Cowboy Ethics: What Wall Street can Learn from the Code of the West was written by James Owen, an investment consultant who after ENRON and the other Wall Street scandals of a few years ago, decided it was time to take a good look at what we had become. Like myself, he is not a genuine cowboy but we both have a great deal of respect and admiration for the cowboy and the cowboy way of life.
After talking with real cowboys and researching the cowboy way, he came up with his Code of the West which states some simple principles that all of us should try to live by.
* Live each day with courage
* Take pride in your work
* Always finish what you start
* Do what has to be done
* Be tough, but fair
* When you make a promise, keep it
* Ride for the brand
* Talk less and say more
* Remember that some things aren’t for sale
* Know where to draw the line
Recently he published the second volume called Cowboy Values: Recapturing What America Has Lost which talks about the basic values that used to be second nature to most Americans, but somehow got lost in a celebrity obsessed culture that glorifies materialism and instant gratification and where winning at all costs has replaced the credo of the race well run. Here is Jim’s list of core values.
* Courage
* Optimism
* Self-Reliance
* Authenticity
* Honor
* Duty
* Heart
Somewhere along the line we forgot these basic ethics and values and replaced them with a self-centered “grab all you can and forget the consequences” attitude. Many of our political and business leaders need a crash course in the principles and ideals of these two books and none too soon.
We have politicians who cheat on their wives. If a man will break his vows to his wife what do you think he will do to you? We have politicians who walk away from their financial obligations and receive special treatment unavailable to you and me. If they can’t handle their own money what do you think they will do with yours? We have politicians who preach ethics and values only to fall from grace themselves for not practicing them. We have business leaders who have been convicted of using the stockholder’s money as a personal piggy bank then say with a straight face they were business expenses.
And we ourselves are just as guilty when we buy things we can’t afford and then when we can’t pay look for help from those who didn’t.
My whole point is that with all the advances we have made of as a society, we seem to have left behind those things that we should treasure most-the basic truths that right is right and wrong is wrong. That there is no free ride and either we pull together or we will pull ourselves apart. That we all need to face up to our problems because if we face up to them and meet them head-on, they won’t seem half as bad than if we ignore them.
You’ll never see a cowboy on a psychiatrist’s couch.
Bloggers Note: For all you Baby Boomers out there who remember Saturday TV shows with Roy Rogers or Saturday matinees at the local theater with Hopalong Cassidy here is a link to the “codes” of our favorite cowboy stars: <http://www.elvaquero.com/The_Cowboy_Code.htm>http://www.elvaquero.com/The_Cowboy_Code.htm

Subject: A MUST READ PROPOSAL !!!

from Mickey D...............




                         IT'S TIME !





The Proposal:
When a company falls on difficult times, one of the things that seems to happen is they reduce their staff and workers.  The remaining workers need to find ways to continue to do a good job or risk that their job would be eliminated as well.  Wall street, and the media normally congratulate the CEO for making this type of "tough decision", and his board of directors gives him a big bonus. 

Our government should not be immune from similar risks.  

Therefore: Reduce the House of Representatives from the current 435 members to 
218 members and Senate members from 100 to 50 (one per State).  Also reduce remaining staff by 25%.

Accomplish this over the next 8 years.  (two steps / two elections) and of course this would require some redistricting.

Some yearly monetary gains include: 

$44,108,400 for elimination of base pay for congress.  (267 members X $165,200 pay / member / year.)

$97,175,000 for elimination of the above people's staff.  (estimate $1.3 Mil in staff per each member of the House, and $3 Mil in staff per each member of the Senate every year)

$240,294 for the reduction in remaining staff by 25%. 

$7,500,000,000 reduction in pork barrel ear-marks each year.  (those members whose jobs are gone.  Current estimates for total government pork earmarks are at $15 Billion / year)

The remaining representatives would need to work smarter and would need to improve efficiencies.  It might even be in their best interests to work together for the good of our country? 

We may also expect that smaller committees might lead to a more efficient resolution of issues as well.  It might even be easier to keep track of what your representative is doing. 

Congress has more tools available to do their jobs than it had back in 
1911 when the current number of representatives was established.  (telephone, computers, cell phones to name a few)

Note: 
Congress did not hesitate to head home when it was a holiday, when the nation needed a real fix to the economic problems.  Also, we have 3 senators that have not been doing their jobs for the past 18+ months (on the campaign trail) and still they all have been accepting full pay.  These facts alone support a reduction in senators & congress. 

Summary of opportunity: 

$ 44,108,400 reduction of congress members. 

$282,100,000 for elimination of the reduced house member staff. 

$150,000,000 for elimination of reduced senate member staff. 

$59,675,000 for 25% reduction of staff for remaining house members. 

$37,500,000 for 25% reduction of staff for remaining senate members. 

$7,500,000,000 reduction in pork added to bills by the reduction of congress members. 

$8,073,383,400 per year, estimated total savings.  

Big business does these types of cuts all the time.

If congress persons were required to serve 20, 25 or 30 years (like everyone else) in order to collect retirement benefits there is no telling how much we would save. Now they get full retirement after serving only ONE term.  

IF you are happy how the Congress spends our taxes, then just delete this message.  IF you are not happy, then I assume you know what to do.

Subject: 1 Trillion Dollars

This is pretty impressive.  I have a hard time conceptualizing 1 million dollars.  I remember the time when $100 was a huge sum. 

from Paul S......






What does one TRILLION dollars look like?

All this talk about "stimulus packages" and "bailouts"...
A billion dollars...
A hundred billion dollars...
Eight hundred billion dollars...
One TRILLION dollars...
What does that look like? I mean, these various numbers are tossed around like so many doggie treats, so I thought I'd take <http://sketchup.google.com/>Google Sketchup out for a test drive and try to get a sense of what exactly a trillion dollars looks like.
We'll start with a $100 dollar bill. Currently the largest U.S. denomination in general circulation. Most everyone has seen them, slighty fewer have owned them. Guaranteed to make friends wherever they go.
A packet of one hundred $100 bills is less than 1/2" thick and contains $10,000. Fits in your pocket easily and is more than enough for week or two of shamefully decadent fun.
Believe it or not, this next little pile is $1 million dollars (100 packets of $10,000). You could stuff that into a grocery bag and walk around with it.
While a measly $1 million looked a little unimpressive, $100 million is a little more respectable. It fits neatly on a standard pallet...
And $1 BILLION dollars... now we're really getting somewhere...
Next we'll look at ONE TRILLION dollars. This is that number we've been hearing about so much. What is a trillion dollars? Well, it's a million million. It's a thousand billion. It's a one followed by 12 zeros.
You ready for this?
It's pretty surprising.
Go ahead...
Scroll down...
Ladies and gentlemen... I give you $1 trillion dollars....
(And notice those pallets are double stacked.)
So the next time you hear someone toss around the phrase "trillion dollars"... that's what they're talking about

Subject: Judge Ned Mangum's blind decision is constitutionally unsound!

Comment: I was very disturbed by this. Is it constitutional for a Judge to be making decisions based on personal bias, and private agenda? I believe this action is just another step closer to the slippery slope of big government, fascism, dictatorship, and a loss of liberty in the USA. ------------------------------------------- YOUR GOVERNMENT AT WORK Judge orders homeschoolers into public district classrooms Decides children need more 'focus' despite testing above grade levels -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: March 11, 2009 11:25 pm Eastern By Bob Unruh Â© 2009 WorldNetDaily A North Carolina judge has ordered three children to attend public schools this fall because the homeschooling their mother has provided over the last four years needs to be "challenged." The children, however, have tested above their grade levels â€“ by as much as two years. The decision is raising eyebrows among homeschooling families, and one friend of the mother has launched a website to publicize the issue. The ruling was made by Judge Ned Mangum of Wake County, who was handling a divorce proceeding for Thomas and Venessa Mills.
