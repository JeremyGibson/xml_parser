To Dennis Helms, Chief Censor for the State of North Carolina:
Been up to your old Censorship Tricks again eh, Dennis?
.
I received an Email Valentine from Rockingham Community College.
It got thru to me, because I guess you haven't figured out how to 
Censor my incoming Email.
.
I thought, well, finally Dennis has fixed his problem.  Or maybe he's
been caught and got fired.  So I sent a Thanks to 3 on Staff at RCC.
.
As always, you Censored it.  Three separate bounce messages,
claiming User Unknown, which is of course a lie.
.
I figured ways around your Censorship which allows me to send Email
to State Agencies from another address -- but not from this one -- which
proves conclusively that you ARE selectively Censoring my Email.
.
The case against you is rock solid and undeniable: You Censor Email.
.
How many State Employees, who you deny Email to, know you're reading
their Email, and deciding what you will deliver and what you will not?
You've even Censored Email to Members of the General Assembly!
.
I'm sending copies of this to Gov Bev and Lt Gov Dalton, to see if you
Censor their Email also.  May send it to a lot of others, too.
_________________________________
.
You've lied to me often, saying you've fixed it.
And then you Censor again.  And again.  And AGAIN!
.
Don't have time right now to deal with your dishonesty, 
but your time will come, rest assured. 
.
You have one, and only one, way out:  Immediately send out EVERY 
Email you have Censored, EVER, with a Preface note expressing your 
deepest, most profound apology. 
.
You cannot blame a computer for this. You did it. 
You're 1000% responsible.
.
Have a marvelous Valentine's Day, Dennis!
.
Cordially,
Gene Messick
.
