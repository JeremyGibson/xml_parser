Maryanne:

Ms. Veitch sent a suggestion in – without being too detailed, the “suggestions” are collected in an Excel spreadsheet and are not reviewed every day. There are thousands of suggestions! Is this something you all could contact her about to get more information or should I refer this elsewhere? If you need to be search the spreadsheets I’ll be happy to. Just let me know.



Thanks,
Kelley

Hello,

  I previously sent an e-mail about making a sizable art donation to one of the State Museums. Would someone please contact me about this?  Thank you,
