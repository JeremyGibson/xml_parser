The State Health Plan (the Plan) is in receipt of an email from the Governor's Office concerning your health plan coverage.

As the Plan reviews the financial performance during this fiscal year, we want to reassure you that your health care coverage is in full effect and all claims will continue to be paid. 

The Plan remains committed to restoring cash reserves and strengthening financial health.   Throughout this process, transparency for our members and taxpayers is an important value.  Closely monitoring our “recasted,” or revised budget, against actual expenditures is a key part of this process.

Our State Health Plan is one of the largest employer-based health plans in North Carolina.  Like most plans around the country, it has struggled to keep premiums from escalating as health care costs increase.  As the Plan seeks to balance the concerns around cost and affordability, we are committed to our mission of providing quality health care products and services to enhance your health and wellbeing.

Over the coming months, the Plan will explore and present a wide range of viable options for our membership of 662,000.  Many of these programs and services will address both health status and cost savings.  We are concerned about the future and will develop programs that can be successful for members and the Plan. 

Please visit our website at <http://www.shpnc.org>www.shpnc.org for continued updates concerning this process.

Thanks for contacting the Governor's Office and if you have any additional questions, please call the Plan at 1-888-234-2416.

The State Health Plan (the Plan) has received an email from the Governor's Office concerning your health care coverage.

To summarize, the State Health Plan underestimated administrative expenses.  Also, the Plan’s forecasting model was seriously off the mark.  We are striving to learn from past errors and to correct this situation going forward, and we are taking appropriate steps to improve cash flow.

The State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees is focused on restoring cash reserves and strengthening the financial health of the Plan for you, our members.

Our State Health Plan is one of the largest employer-based health plans in North Carolina.  Like most plans around the country, it has struggled to keep premiums from escalating as health care costs increase.  As the Plan seeks to balance the concerns around cost and affordability, we are committed to our mission of providing quality health care products and services to enhance your health and wellbeing.

Over the coming months, the Plan will explore and present a wide range of viable options for our membership of 662,000.  Many of these programs and services will address both health status and cost savings.  We are concerned about the future and will develop programs that can be successful for members and the Plan.  I will provide you with more information as these programs unfold.

Ultimately, solutions to the Plan’s budget shortfall will be determined by the General Assembly during the 2009 Legislative Session, as they face the challenge of funding the State Health Plan.  

Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives continue, as the Plan strives to appropriately reduce expenses in programs and services. 

The North Carolina Children's Health Insurance Program is not funded with State Health Plan money.  It is funded by the federal and appropriated state government money.

Following is the question just received:

Visitor: Mrs. Claire Primrose

Address: 1805 s. live oak pkwy, wilmington, NC 28403

Email: vctrianfem@aol.com

Subject: NC State Health Plan

Comment: Like other State employees I am alarmed by the shortfall in the State Health Plan. How is it possible that as late as June of 2008 there was a projection of a $50 million surplus, and yet there is in fact a shortfall of as much as $300 million. How much of this is attributable to state employees, and how much to NC Health Choice. I would like to emphasize that my question about how this came about is not a rhetorical one-I’d like to know.
