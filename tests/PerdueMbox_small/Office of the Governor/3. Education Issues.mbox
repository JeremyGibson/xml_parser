Governor Perdue,



I want to express my appreciation for your continued support in understanding the importance of Early Childhood Programs.  Recent research shows a direct correlation between quality Early Childhood Programs for students at risk and the drop out rate, the incarceration rate and the ability to financially maintain oneself rather that relying on welfare.  Students at risk can never catch up to their peers without a direct intervention before entering kindergarten because of the deceit in their language and early literacy skills.  These children enter kindergarten with a huge gap in their ability to learn to read. Without closing this  Achievement Gap we will continue to pay heavy tax dollars in incarcerating these young adults, paying for the children that they have through Medicare and WIC and also the countless other tax dollars that are spent because they are not capable of maintaining full-time work.



I have attached or copied the recent research that I have read so that you may be well aware of the importance of Early Childhood Programs.  Please continue to make this one of your top priorities so that at risk children can have the opportunity to enter kindergarten ready to learn, have successful school careers and graduate to become viable citizens of our communalities.

Comment: Dear Mrs. Perdue, Please, help us to make Buncombe County Schools Superintendent, Mr. Dodson, realize that the excellence of education that Ms. Flores has delivered to our children in Oakley school is priceless. We and several more people are willing to come up with the money ($1,500.00) to pay Ms. Flores extension work permit with immigration. Please, help us. We had reached out to local and state education offices but it seems that Buncombe County School Administration is untouchable. We know you care for the education of our children, they are the future of our country. Respectfully Sonia Molina Parent from Oakley Elementary School

Subject: PLEASE support FIPP

Comment: Hello, With state budget reductions being planned for 2009-2010, my husband and I wanted to take some time to speak to you on behalf of a much needed program that supports children in our local community. The Family, Infant and Preschool Program (FIPP) serves over 1500 children and families in our community annually, not only through home visitations, but also through center-based group programs in Alexander, Burke, and Caldwell counties. FIPP provides support for children who are diagnosed or at-risk for a disability or developmental delay and offers services for families as early as pregnancy and through age 8. In 2008 alone, FIPP served children with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, hearing impairment, mental retardation, multiple disabilities, developmental delays, communication impairments, orthopedic impairments, pervasive developmental disorder, and traumatic brain injury. FIPP also provides support for children who are considered "typically" developing and/or gifted. Without FIPP, countless families would have no where to turn! FIPP is also a training site for over 75 university students annually from the fields of early education, special education, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychology, and social work. As a parent of a child who attends FIPP, my heart is breaking knowing this service may no longer be available to my child due to budget cuts. As a Board Certified Music Therapist, I know that early intervention is KEY for children with disabilities - without programs such as FIPP, these children will be lost in the system. My child benefits from the support/teaching provided from the staff at FIPP. My child is exposed to many different children, cultures, disabilities - something that he would not be exposed to any where else and something that has helped to mold him into the person he is today! FIPP is an amazing program that is NEEDED in our community and for our children - please continue to support the Family, Infant and Preschool Program and please continue to support the children in our great state! Thank you for your time and support, Christi, Gary, and Daniel Kreahling

Comment: I just wanted to let you know that I am very disappointed in the decision to cut teacher's pay. I cannot believe that the people who are responsible for teaching our children & who have a very difficult job are being treated this way. I feel like government makes cuts from the "bottom" taking from those who live pay check to pay check rather than cutting from those at the top who are not concerned about paying their bills, putting food on the table or going to the doctor. I am truly disappointed in YOUR decision. I thought you should know. OH and I am NOT a public school teacher...I teach preschoolers in a church. Judy Ipock

Comment: I am a first year teacher at a low income school in Wake county. Our entire staff is filled with very dedicated workers working extremely hard to get our students up to state and federal standards. These students come from troubled homes and are filled with challenges I havent even seen. Each year are school doesnt meet AYP and we dont get any lovely bonuses. Therefore, I use every penny the state and the county give me! I really dont appreciate they retrograded pay cut and the pay freeze for next year. Arent there other people's salary to cut besides teacher.

Subject: Teacher and Teacher Assistant Jobs PLEASE READ

Comment: I understand of how the economy is, but I do not understand why you have to cut back on teacher and teacher assistant and salaries. My Parents are teacher assistant and my sister is a Teacher and she also just had a baby, all this about cutting jobs and money is terrible. People are suppose to want to be a teacher but with all these bad things going on to Teachers, they are looking else where. Teachers are the people that are looking into the future and helping children, but who are helping the teachers? We are in Franklin County, and this county has hardly any money and I feel that the jobs or the money that should be cut, is the people who are making Hundreds of Thousands of dollars. The middle class is making over 100,000, that means more than over half the people are in the low class. Something just isn't right about that. I understand everyone has their jobs, but the cuts should go to the big industries where they were suits to work and make millions of dollars.

Subject: What is right?

Comment: I am not asking for favors, but I just want to know why (I) am being persecuted by my local former superintendent and board of education. On May 4, 2008, I recieved a DWI (away from school) and on May 5th, I was suspended with pay dependent on the outcome of the infraction. I can not lie, I was guilty. However, before the infraction date for court, I obtained a lawyer and the goal was to save my educational career. I pled guilty to the offense hoping that even if I didn't get my job back as principal, I would be reinstated at another level. The impression I received from the superintendent was that he wanted to save my career. I was wrong. The superintendent and several board members first and foremost scheme was to have me remove. You see, I was born and raise in this county. Graduated from high school. After high school I went to Pitt Technical Institute, later to return to Hyde County and start out as a substitute bus driver, cafeteria worker, and substitute teacher because I could not find a job in the business field. You see I had obtained an 2-year degree (A.A.S) in General Office Technology. After working for a year or two in these positions, I obtained a job as an teacher assistant, where I worked for thirteen years in grades two through 6. While in this position, I found where I should be. I took a leave of absence from my job in 1991 and returned to East Carolina University to obtain my teacher certification. In 1994 I graduated with a degree in Elementary Education k-6. I received my first teaching job at Mattamuskeet Middle School in 1996 as a 7th grade Language Arts and Social Studies Teacher. After working two years in 7th grade I was moved to the elementary school (since I was not middle school certified) in the county. I worked their teaching fifth and sixth grade language arts and social studies. During that time I gain a few recognitions from my peers. When Hyde mainland Hyde County Schools merged, I was back at the middle school teaching sixth science and social studies. Although, this was a case of questionable circumstances, I stayed and did what God has given me to do. I went on to teach at the middle school from 1999 to 2001. In 2001, I earned my middle grades language arts certification and later went on to earn my Masters in School Administration. In 2002, I was hired as AP as Mattamuskeet Schools (elementary, middle, and high). In 2003, I was hired as principal of the middle school. My record speaks for itself and the students, parents, and my staff, as well as my other peers can speak for me and my contribution to the middle school. As I said before, I did receive a DWI. Once the Superintedent informed me that he wanted me to resign, I was devastated. I obtained a lawyer from NCAE (J. McGuinness) and he felt we had a strong case and we pursued. However after the first hearing with the school's lawyer and his witnesses, the suggestion was that I resign or my name would be placed on a hit list and I would never be able to work in North Carolina again. The lawyer for the school was Schwartz and I am sure that you know him. I spoke with board members who supported me, but because of family issues, my baby sister dealing with cancer, my other sister, the former social worker of the same school system, being ousted out; I felt defeated. You see my former sister, age 49 has a chronic illness (MS). And she too was loved by the students. However, they wanted her out and out she came. Well, finally, I applied for unemployment in August and finally received some benefits around October, I think. But on December 1st, I was opposed by the superintendent and benefits were denied. So since December I have had no income. I realize I made a mistake and I realize that there is more that you need to know (that I will tell you) if you want ot hear. However, I am unemployed (Why?) Other things have happened in the system, where nothing was done. What is right? Please talk with me. Currently I am teaching a GED class for Beaufort Community College. I earn ten and one half hour a week. Why won't they let me have unemployment until I can get back on my feet. And it is going to be even worse; because now state employees have been given a cut in pay. With my years of service in education, It is going to be very difficult for me to find a job. Hope to hear from you.

Subject: teacher's salary and health benefits

Comment: Governor Perdue, Please do not cut teacher's salaries and reduce insurance benefits, making us pay more for premiums and increasing co-pays. We are giving our days to the children of this state and we need to be protected to continue to do our job well. Please help us and do not take this money from us. You want teachers to stay in the field, give us no cuts in salary or benefits. We rely on your help. Please allocate these funds back to teachers. Also, we are very worried about services being cut for the students we teach due to Mecklenburg Country cuts. Where are the priorities? Should they not be for the teachers and children?? Please help us. Thank you.

Subject: Smart Start

Comment: With all the budgets restraints and the economy trying to come back. My question is will it hit Smart Start. I know young children is where we need to start giving children the opportunity to learn but some of the offices seem overwhelmed with staffing. Take Rockingham Partnership for Children they have an enormous amount of staff and seem to be going at a slow pace with no real concerns.I have been in childcare for thirty years and last year was hit with unemployment. So I can say first hand there is a lot there they just don't seem right. I live in Eden where as you know unemployment is extremely high and looking at monies being sent back from our school system, while others skim and no notice taken or directed at them. I love children but our older children seem to have to pay the price. Will it ever affect these organizations or are they off limits? Thank you for your time.

Comment: Hello, I am a Sophmore in high school. The graduation project has already taken up a lot of our classroom time. Many students do not have the recources, like a computer, to work on the project outside of school. As an IB student I already have a more in depth extended essay (research paper). and this graduation project will just hold many students back. Some students are going to decide that dropping out is easier than doing this project. Help us get rid of this not thought through project!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am a student at Rocky Mount High School. Recently, the Graduation Project has been required by the State for all highschool students. I am going into the International Baccalaurette program and the work load is already tough enough. The Graduation Project is just another burden for students. Some students cannot afford the things that the Project requires. Some students do not have computers at their homes, so therefore have limited time to work on this project. The Graduation Project is very time consuming. Please help the students and do away with the Graduation Project. Sincerely, Caroline Nelson

Subject: The Graduation Project

Comment: Mrs.Purdue this year we began working on the graduation project. The project is very straneous and takes a lot of time. The critera seems as if it was just thrown together. Many students have dropped out of school and since President Barack Obama is trying to lower the drop out rate the project isn't helping. The project sounds like a good idea but when you really take a look at the time and expenses that the project requires you'll see that many students don't have the resources to complete the project. It isn't fair for someone to be denied graduation because they don't have the resources to complete a project. Mrs Perdue we are depending on you to put an end to this project. Please support bill 223. Thank You

Comment: Hello, I just want to explain a few things about the gradustion project which is now a big issue at my school. This project requires too much time that we do not have. This project also requires money to hire a mentor and maybe some other things and some students here don't even have families to go home to, let alone money to pay someone. I really feel like they expect a little to much out of us. We would really appreciate it if you could help do away with the graduation project. Thank you for your time!

Subject: Enough for Teachers!

Comment: What are you thinking? Enough is enough! Our teachers are going to take pay cuts from their already inadequate salaries, and now you're cutting benefits, too! Let's get those "old school" retired teachers who are being payed TWO salaries out of the classrooms and make room for some new, fresh ideas from young teachers. According to the new health care plan, overweight teachers are only qualified for basic coverage? Wow! If that isn't discrimination, I don't know what is! How about cutting some of the excess? Union County has a TQE director! The corporate world abandoned TQE YEARS ago! That salary could pay three teachers! You promise lottery money to education, then take it so that your budget will be balanced! Shame on you! Who's going to suffer the most? Our CHILDREN! You are NOT the education governor for whom I voted. I wish I had known.....

Subject: TEACHER PAY CUTS!

Comment: I would just like to know what happened to the campaign promise made by Gov. Perdue of not lowering teacher pay??? That promise lasted a long time! It seems to me that this will just run our education system and economy even further into the ground. We already have under qualified individuals filling position that the qualified ones don't want due to the compensation that teachers receive or should I say don't receive. It seems to me it would make more sense to compensate those that are trained educators and eliminate some other wasteful spending within our state. THANKS FOR THE PROMISES!

Subject: teachers

Comment: I just wanted to drop you a line about the teacher and education cuts in our state. Personally I think it is absurd that you ask the teachers to take a pay cut, some up to around 5% and you are asking your people to take a 1/2% cut. Also, I'm sick of hearing about how much money the so-called education lottery has made. If it has made so much, why aren't you using more of it to fund education like it's meant for. I don't think people would mind or even notice if the pots were smaller, especially if it's going to education. Our education system in this country is bad enough and one way to make it worse is cut teachers pay. They don't have enough help or time to do the job now. How about taking more from the lottery and make our education system here in NC the best in the country. Also, DC has a program to rid the system of bad teachers by having a spy go to the schools, evaluate them and rid the schools of bad teachers. There are a lot of teachers out there that do a great job and should not be penalized. Just my thoughts and you should know, I date a teacher and hear about all the things going on in certain schools. No child left behind is also a big joke. All this means around here is if the parents make a big enough stink, it doesn't matter what the teacher thinks about not letting the student pass, he/she is pushed on. Real good for the students future. Just my $.02. Bruce Benninger

Subject: Still waiting for an answer!

Comment: I am still patiently waiting for an answer on why teachers of this state have to pay for the lack of responsiblity of our government? We are not the ones who made excuses and justified over spending in this state. No wonder our country is in such shambles. Our government doesn't take responsibility & makes excuses for everything. Our county has allowed people to sue for spilling hot coffee on themselves when the cup has warnings (HOT) all over it. Our country has allowed thiefs to sue home owner for when he broke his own leg while in the process of stealing from them. Our county makes it harder each year for schools to properly discipline students that are highly distruptive in the classroom and keeps other students from learning (and it doesn't teach them responsibilty or respect for others). They walk away each and everyday knowing they beat the system because schools don't have a leg to stand on and that RESPECT is lost in the education system. We need a government who is willing to take responsiblity back and stop making lame excuses for why our state is a mess. That doesn't include taking money from those who barely make any to start out, nor from those who are trying their best to make NC futures a responsible success.

Subject: Burke County School accredidation, and our disfunctional school board

Comment: Dear Governor, We need your help desperately. We are a wonderful little town in western, NC with some big problems. Our school board has put our children in an awful place of having our national accredidation removed if they don't make some changes to recent policy. They are trying to fire our beloved superintendent of education, Mr. David Burleson. They have illegally ended his contract robbing him of 27 years of service. Honestly it is a person agenda. David has not backed all of their decisions and they have been out for blood forever. Please look up our mess on Morganton News Herald, or you can trace us through major tv. affiliates. The current mess is that now they want to use our tax money slotted for schools to pay for a special council to bail thier backsides out of trouble. Not only is the broken contract going to cost us $130,000.000 but the special council will be 10's of thousands more. We have lost so many jobs. Would you want to send your company to a county where their children can't get a nationally certified education? Of course not. They have already started the process to fire 72 teachers in our county, cut our sports program, cut our class aids, and even asked for toilet paper to get by. Can you believe this is NC. I served in south africa as a missionary and I never thought America would come to this. I would love to talk with you, get your help, get advice from someone about how to stop this madness. Our children are suffering and we need your help. Thank you for any response that will lead me to someone who can help us. By the way the board members names are, Tim Buff, Tracey Norman, chairwoman, Karen Sain, and Rob Hairfield that are causing us so much grief. If you see anyone with those name tags one coming your way I suggest you get a body guard or an exorcist because these people are EVIL! Sincerely, Rev. Eddy Bunton 828-437-2357. HELP US PLEASE!

Subject: Education Lottery

Comment: I just saw a commercial on TV that said we have earned over 1 billion dollars with the "education lottery". So my question is why do teachers have to take a paycut when we are earning over 1 billion dollars with the "education" lottery.

Subject: Education Bill and Teacher Cuts

Comment: I have been a teacher in the North Carolina school system for five years. I would like to know why there is a bill that is being presented that will increase class size? That will do nothing but promote failure and increase the drop out rate in North Carolina. Also, if this bill is passed, 6,000 teachers in NC will lose their jobs. Why don't you talk to the ones who are in the classrooms before making these ignorant decisions because of lack of monetary resources. Where is the "educational" lottery money raised?

Subject: teacher salary

Comment: Dear Ms Perdue, I was very disappointed to see that you have cut our teachers pay. Our teachers are severely underpaid as it is. Many of them use money out of their pockets to supply school supplies for their students. I think there certainly could have been a more creative way to come up with this shortfall. What about taking a larger percentage from administration? Our teachers are on the front lines..teaching our children. Our administration is much too top heavy. And, what about this education lottery? Why don't you form or redistribute some personel to look for waste in all departments? But, for heavens sake...take care of our educators who are on the front lines..face to face.. with our children! They need all the support they can get- emotionally and monitarily! Sincerely! Brenda Mickey

Subject: Teachers

Comment: I would just like to say that it is extremely unfair to take back state employee's salaries. I realize that the state is in trouble; however, it is not the responsibility of the people working for state agencies to fix that. MANY of us are living paycheck to paycheck, myself included. There are times at the end of the month that I have no idea where I'll get the gas money to even go to work. While a half percent doesn't matter that much, it's the fact that it's being taken out over 2 checks without any warning. I realize that $200 may not be much to some people, but I am a single woman with no one to rely on. I need time to plan for extra expenses so that I can move my money around (something I guess those in power don't know anything about). I can't tell you how much of my own personal money has gone into my classroom or to things to help my students. I just can't believe that there's money to make commercials to brag about the "education lottery" making so much money over the last three years, but yet I can't get supplies or even my full paycheck. I've never complained about the countless hours I've spent preparing and planning lessons, calling parents, tutoring students, or grading papers, but now that I'm actually losing my money, I am. THIS is why education isn't valued more in this state. When the state government doesn't care about it's teachers, why would the parents? If you want to save money, why don't you stop programs like free breakfasts and lunches for those who are not truly in need? Do public school systems really need to have so many reading coaches, curriculum facilitators and lead teachers? If the state wants to see test scores go up, put those people back into classrooms. I have 30 sixth graders at a time in three different classes, where too much of my time is spent dealing with problem behaviors instead of teaching because that's just too many students to work with at one time. Stop giving teachers so many extra things to do that are a waste of time and resources, such as PEP's, and allow us to actually work with the children and do our jobs. But above all, if we must do all these extra things, at least pay us the money that was promised when we signed our contracts. I have upheld my responsibilities as stated by my contract. Now it's time for the other end to do so as well.

Comment: I realize that there is major problems with monies funding our state, but to take from our teachers will only make things worse. My wife is a teacher & is still in good spirits for the most part. but we feel this is a knife in the back of the education system. While being a teacher is a hard enough job (& we spend about $1300 of our personal money for her classroom), to take this percentage from our already strained income really disheartens our educators & after all... when our educators lose the vision, where does that leave our kids? I am praying for you all as our leaders & whether this is what God led you to do or not, I pray that you will prosper & you would lead people like my wife & I to prosper. Love in Christ Mike

Subject: Loss of Accreditation

Comment: My name is Karen Porter and I am a resident of Burke County.I am absolutely shattered by the turn of events with our school boards decision to end David Burleson's contract and endanger our students with loss of accreditation by their foolishness.I am a single mother of a sophomore who DOES wish to go to college.I don't have a college fund.I make barely above minimum wage working at a church run child development center.I DON"T get child support.There is an order but he can't be found.THIS time he owes towards 6500 dollars which we'll never see.Two years ago a judge had to write off 14000(yes,thousand) dollars child support because he was incarcerated without work release.North Carolina laws at work for the citizens again! That's ok I tell my son,we will make it somehow.Then I develop epilepsy.My medicine runs over $600 a month(no insurance).I don't qualify for medicaid.I don't qualify for insurance because I can't work the full 40 hours.I refuse to try for disability because I am not disabled if I have my medicine(just handicapped in many ways).So I apply for patient assistant programs. I want to model for my son a different kind of person than one who just gives up.He was pressing on towards the goal of college(with grants,maybe a track scholarship,etc). Now with the possible loss of accreditation,that is all down the tubes.By the way,my son has auditory processing disorder and has fought the valiant fight to overcome the obstacles that come with that particular disorder as far as academic struggles.He deserves the chance to have a future.Raleigh,quit telling us your hands are tied!

Comment: Julie Erickson 2 Kory Place Jamestown, NC 27282-8432 May 7, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Please make sure you do everything possible to fully fund education. I am a parent and a teacher. The schools already have enough discipline problems because of lazy parents and making the class sizes bigger will only hurt the student's performance. My children complain all the time about the teacher having to disciplinew the same students day in and day out. This is frustrating to them. They know they are not learning everything they are supposed to learn but the constant problems with student gets old. Please do not take money away from our teachers. Most teachers do nto stop working once they leave school. I know that I put in at least 20 additional hours beyond what I put in at school in order to be prepared. Today's students need to be entertained. THey do not learn from the old way. The teacher needs to over plan and use as much technology as possible to keep the students engaged. Many teachers are not as savvy with technology and it requires a great deal of time for them to learn and prepare. Sincerely, Julie Erickson 3364714696

Subject: deduction in salary for teachers

Comment: I would like to know how the govenor sleeps at night after making such a decision. I know she has gas for her automobile and food on her table. My son came her from NY, one of the hardest states to get a teaching degree in. He came with a masters degree. NC didn't even acknowledge it. Yet, you will fast track TA so you can get teachers. You will even pay for them to stay home and study. This is how you get qualified teachers. Now you turn around and and deduct 1 1/2% from their salary. How are they suppose to survive. After they pay all there bills, some of them have $100 left for the MONTH for gas and food. Obama says education is important to this country, but you are saying the opposite. YOU are hurting our teachers. Your salary is the lowest, but you want the best. I'am going to e-mail President Obama. I want to hear his response about you decision to penalize our teachers.

Subject: Severe cuts with schools?!

Comment: I was at my daughter's school at 3:30 yesterday for an IEP meeting. While there, I started to notice how warm it was getting. After the meeting, the teachers and Vice Principal said it was because you mandated that all the schools program the AC to turn on at 8:30am and off at 3pm. That is absurd!!! The teachers and staff have enough to deal with, now you are making them sweat and unable to concentrate in the mornings/afternoons! Not to mention that the YMCA has afterschool at our school. My daughter goes to this program. They are having to use fans in the building to endure the heat. Our school is year-round and cutting off the AC at any time in the afternoons or not before 8:30am will cause undo harm/inconenience to the students and staff. We have EOG's coming up and there is NO WAY the students will do their best when it takes quite a while for the AC to cool down a building. The EOG's start at 8:45am!!! I am outraged at this...I see that you are also requesting that judges take a pay cut...how about making it manatory? Teachers made little as it is and do this because they love teaching. Taking away money and now AC is unbelievable and as a tax payer and US CITIZEN, I insist that you look at your plan more closely. Are you taking a pay cut?! There are many other ways to save money than directly impacting our children and schools. Cindy Puryear

There has been much information presented to us on the budget cuts to school systems and municipalities. Cutting teachers, books, services, etc have been shown. But no where have I seen administrators at any level offer to take a pay cut. You need to cut the budget 20%, cut administrative salaries by 20%. Six figure salaries, while the majority struggle is not working. I was in the now defunct textile industry. At companies I worked, we took 10% cuts and more to survive the tougher times. Nobody wants to, but at least you have a job. I would encourage you to consider an across the board pay cut for all State, Count, and other municipal salaried administrative employees. For the sake of our children, move quickly.

Comment: I received this email today. THIS IS GREAT! I thought that I would share this with you. I feel that it is important as a citizen of the USA to communicate with you as our governer and ask for your help... please read and think about what we are asking of our teachers today. It is disgraceful. Something needs to be done. Please help the USA! The sad part about this is email is that it is REALITY in America today. CHANGE starts with me communicating with you. Please help these teachers and this country. This is the email: After being interviewed by the school administration, the prospective teacher said: 'Let me see if I've got this right.. 'You want me to go into that room with all those kids, correct their disruptive behavior, observe them for signs of abuse, monitor their dress habits, censor their T-shirt messages, and instill in them a love for learning. 'You want me to check their backpacks for weapons, wage war on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases, and raise their sense of self esteem and personal pride. 'You want me to teach them patriotism and good citizenship, sportsmanship and fair play, and how to register to vote, balance a checkbook, and apply for a job. 'You want me to check their heads for lice, recognize signs of antisocial behavior, and make sure that they all pass the final exams. 'You also want me to provide them with an equal education regardless of their handicaps, and communicate regularly with their parents in English, Spanish or any other language, by letter, telephone, newsletter, and report card. 'You want me to do all this with a piece of chalk, a blackboard, a bulletin board, a few books, a big smile, and a starting salary that qualifies me for food stamps. 'You want me to do all this and then you tell me. . . I CAN'T PRAY?

Subject: Work Study for College Students

Comment: Hi, My name is Ronald Pemberton. I am a 20 year old African American male about to enter my 3rd year of college at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. My financial aid advisor informs me that because of budget cuts to education made by you, I will not be receiving work study as part of my financial aid package for the 2009-2010 school year. My mother has no job because it was transferred overseas, I also do not have a job because I do not have any form of transportation. Therefore, for the last 2 years I have relied on work study to help me meet ends. I have a phone bill to pay, and food to buy. I have made all possible cut backs; I have resorted to the smallest meal plan offered by the school (10 meals per week) which is not nearly enough for a 7 day week. The school has informed me that I have been put on the waiting list to receive financial work study, meaning, if someone declines their aid then I will become eligible. I do not know how many people are in front of me on that list, and with the current status of the economy I find it very hard to believe that there will be allot of people to decline their aid. This leaves me in a very difficult position. But what I truly do not understand is that my EFC (expected family contribution) for the upcoming school year is 0. Why does this not put me at the top of the list for receiving work study from the school? I have absolutely no income. I truly do not know what I am going to do, I do not believe that taking out an additional loan will help my current situation. I already have 5200.00 worth of loans for the upcoming year. Putting myself in more debt is not a reasonable solution, especially when there is aid that can be given. I am trying my best to not become another stereotype but I am convinced that the system is working against me. I plan to become a physical therapist and my current GPA is 3.42, so you know that this is not a cry for attention, this is a cry for help.

Subject: Teacher Appreciation Letter

Comment: I find the letter that was sent to your teachers rather ironic. No teachers that I speak with feels appreciated, especially while you redistribute the newly named Billion Dollar "EDUCATION" lottery to your more important coffers. I am very disappointed that I voted a straight democratic ticket in November.

Subject: Education

Comment: Dear Mrs. Purdue, I am contacting you to thank you for all that you are doing to keep our state's budget balanced. I understand that the choices that are having to be made are very difficult ones. I am an elementary school teacher and national board certified teacher. I like everyone else in the state took a pay cut of .05 percent and do not mind doing this once to help our state. However, I hear through NCAE that bills are being discussed to take our salary back down to the 2007-2008 schedule. I believe that this pay cut is too much. I am a home owner and have lots of college debt and other responsibilities. This kind of cut is going to make it difficult for me to pay my monthly bills. I refinanced my home for a shorter period of time so my monthly bills are substantially higher. I would hate to see others lose their homes because of unexpected pay cuts. Please fight against this kind of pay cut. I work at a title one school. I am giving 110% to these children. I can't help but think that with these pay cuts that our school systems are really going to suffer. Without good teachers our schools are not going to make adequate progress and prepare our students for the future as well as they should. WIth our economy already suffering it is so important that we produce that brightest, most successful students possible. Please, please please fight against these types of pay cuts. Our states educational future depends on it. Teachers need to be lifted up in these difficult times. Thank you very much for your time and consideration of this matter. Sincerely, Jessica Nance 1st Grade Teacher, NBCT North Albemarle Elementary School

Subject: Education Lottery and Teaching Fellows

Comment: Governor Perdue, I'm trying to understand how to justify advertising on TV about the "education lottery" while money is being diverted from the lottery to non-educational needs. At the same time, my daughter just graduated Magna Cum Laude from NC State University. She is a NC Teaching Fellow, with a commitment to teach for 4 years or pay back $26,000 to the State. Now she can't even get an interview for a job as a teacher. Something seems really wrong with this whole picture. I know funding is tight and the economy is suffering, but I just wonder...are we prioritizing expenditures correctly? Concerned citizen, taxpayer, and Father, Tracy Woolsey
