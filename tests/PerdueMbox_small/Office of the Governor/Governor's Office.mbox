Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Lara Morens 1911 Ellie Ave Fayetteville, NC 28314-8489

Dear Ms. Zinn:

<mailto:teri.riddle@nc.gov> 

Thank you for contacting the Governor with your concern regarding the recent reorganization of the positions held by the former Deputy State Superintendent and Chairman of the State Board of Education and other public education concerns. I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



On Monday, Jan. 26th, the Governor announced a re-organization of the education leadership structure in our state that involves the Chairman of the State Board of Education and the Deputy State Superintendent. Prior to the announcement, these were separate positions, one held by Chairman Howard Lee and the other held by JB Buxton. The Governor's announcement deleted the position of the Deputy State Superintendent and combined the powers and duties of that job with the roles of the former Chairman. Gov. Perdue asked the State Board of Education to redefine the duties of its chair to include the responsibilities of the newly created Chief Executive Officer, who will manage operations of the public school system. Gov. Perdue appointed Dr. Bill Harrison to the Board and the State Board members selected him as their chair.



The Governor's announcement does not change the responsibilities and duties of the elected state superintendent, Dr. Atkinson. As a matter of fact, the Governor announced that she has asked Dr. Atkinson to take on an additional task of heading up a statewide blue-ribbon task force on career development and workforce issues that are so critical to the economic and education backbone of the state.



In regard to the budgetary concerns you express, Governor Perdue is committed to protecting jobs in North Carolina.  On Tuesday, March 17, 2009, the Governor presented her 2009-11 biennial budget.  She has recently released highlights about job protection in the press release included below.  This information serves as a synopsis of her major economic priorities.   



Again, thank you for sharing your concerns with the Governor.  We wish you success as you pursue your educational and professional endeavors and look forward to your joining the teaching profession upon graduation.



Sincerely,

Governor Perdue’s Budget to Focus on Jobs and Economy



As she talked with western North Carolina economic leaders today, Gov. Bev Perdue stressed that protecting and creating jobs and growing the economy will be a top priority in the budget she plans to present on Tuesday.



“We must continue to move North Carolina forward even in these challenging times. In my budget I will make targeted investments to create jobs and prepare North Carolina to be an economic leader as our nation recovers,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Helping small businesses compete more effectively, developing our workforce, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship are all vital to a strong business climate.”



During an economic roundtable in Asheville today, Gov. Perdue announced several of the economic development initiatives that will be included in her budget:



·        Small Business Tax Relief:  Businesses with profits less than $100,000 will be able to exempt the first $25,000 of net income from state tax.  Businesses with profits between $100,000 and $200,000 will exempt the first $15,000.

·        Expand Earned Income Tax Credit:  Beginning in the next calendar year, the credit would be increased from 5% to 6.5%.

·        Jobs Now initiative:  Gov. Perdue’s budget will invest more than $17 million in community college and vocational education courses and programs focused on job training and preparing students for new 21st century careers. 

·        Main Street Solutions program: Invest $7 million in the Main Street Solutions program to expand and transform this initiative into a more comprehensive economic development tool to drive regional job creation in small and medium-sized towns and cities.

·        One NC Small Business Fund: $2 million for small companies to match federal innovation grants.

·        Founder’s Credit: Establish a Founder’s Credit, which will exclude initial stock investments in certain North Carolina start-up companies from capital gains.  This will encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.

·        Green Business Fund: $5 million for the Green Business Fund to encourage the growth of North Carolina businesses as we seek to use fuel and other natural resources more wisely and effectively.  

·        Defense and Aerospace:  $3 million investment for expanding North Carolina’s defense and aerospace industry to create jobs.

·        Destination NC:  $1.5 million to brand North Carolina as a business and tourism destination.

·        Water/Sewer Infrastructure: More than $47 million in state funds to maximize federal resources for water and sewer and other similar infrastructure projects that support economic growth.



Additional measures will be announced with her full budget next week.

Subject: School Teachers Wake County

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I was reading the press release about your first bill signed into law and had a question. The quote below is an attachment from your press release on March 4, 2009... “This new leadership structure will bring a clear line of accountability and efficiency for moving North Carolina’s public schools forward,” said Gov. Perdue. “Our schools can be the best in the nation and I believe these changes will lead to students who become an innovative, well-educated, well-trained workforce of tomorrow.” My question is how to you plan on doing what you are quoted as saying? From all of the Wake County news reports, the WCPSS will only be able to hire back 95% of it's current employees, possibly leaving 1500 teachers and staff without jobs. The reason I ask is that I will be graduating from North Carolina Wesleyan in May of 2009 and I was looking forward to joining the WCPSS as a teacher. As it stands now, the chances of employment seem slim to none. My mother was a teacher in Edgecombe county for 10 years before becoming a principal at GW Bulluck Elementary in Edgecombe County for the last 10 years. I wish to follow in my mother's footsteps as I believe she has had a tremendous positive influence in hundreds of children lives over the years. How do you justify appointing a CEO of Schools, when you already have a superintendent? And why is he being paid $265,000 a year!? This is a slap in the face to every teacher in North Carolina not to mention the current and acting superintendent. This one "created" position just took 8 school teacher's jobs. possibly mine. Where is the Education Lottery money going? There are an estimated 2300 new students expected in Wake County this year. How do you suppose they will be taught? We are one of the FEW North Carolina families currently building/buying a house in Wake County, and if I can not find employment my family and I may lose everything we have invested. Sincerely, Mitzi T. Zinn

Subject: Education

Comment: I am very concerned about the cut back of teachers. We passed a lottery bill that the money would go to education. That was the will of the people, we voted. How can you take lottery money and move it from education and then cut back on teachers? This seems unconstitutional. Also, why do we need another person in charge of education when we have Ms. Atkinson? Do we need both when we need teachers? Where is that money coming from. Ms. Atkinson can do the job if you let her.

Dear Ms. Smith:



    Thank you for your correspondence regarding the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program.  I am responding on behalf of Governor Perdue.



    We appreciate your contacting us to express your concerns about the policies set forth that govern the federally administered Teacher Loan Forgiveness program.  On behalf of teachers our office has been in correspondence with the US Department of Education (who directly administers this program) on numerous occasions to determine if there is any leeway in terms of the date.  We have been notified that the date set is a firm one. 



   You may also wish share your grievances with your Congressman so that they will also be aware of the issues you and other teachers raise regarding the policies.



    Thank you again for contacting our office.  We appreciate all you do to support the students in our public schools.



                                                                                Sincerely,

Subject: Educational Loan

Comment: I am a teacher in a low-income school system. I received my bachelor's degree about 10 years ago with the help of student loans. I received my Master's Degree in May of 2008. I went back to school to strive for this higher degree to help better the lives of my children. This Master's Degree has done just the opposite. I now owe student loan payments that are more than the raise I received from gaining my Master's. I have many questions about the forgiveness policies on educational loans. Because my first educational loan was prior to October 1, 1998, I can not get any of my loans forgiven. This is very upsetting to me. There are many other professions in which student loans are forgiven just by working in a low income community. As a teacher, it is very difficult to make ends meet and when we try to better ourselves it only ends up hurting us. Is there anything that can be done to assist many of us in this predicament? I am a hardworking teacher and really do not understand this Department of Education policy. Could someone help me please?

Thank you for your correspondence regarding education personnel in Cumberland County.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue.

 In regard to your interest in the selection of Interim Superintendent Kinlaw, this would have been an appointment made by the local school board in Cumberland County.  Local school boards are responsible for the selection of the superintendent or interim in their respective counties.  Since you’ve expressed concern about this appointment, we suggest your contacting the local board members in your area to stimulate more discussion of the selection.  The chairman of the local school board is Frank Barragan.  They can be contacted by dialing 910-678-2300.

Comment: As a parent with a child attending a public school in Cumberland County, I am misguided by the appointment of Mr. Tim Kinlaw to serve as Interim Superintendent. While researching his current position as Associate Superintendent of Auxiliary Services, I noticed that the primary duties of the Assistant Superintendent for Auxiliary services supervises the support areas of Transportation, Nutrition Services, Warehouse, Maintenance, Operations, Facilities and Safety Departments. This position is responsible for managing all support areas of the school district to include all insurance and risk related programs. How can Mr. Kinlaw serve in such an important role in the lives of our childrens when his current role doesn't specify any connection with educational services in curriculum. I know that their are quite a few qualified personnel at the Board of Education in Cumberland County with higher level degrees in curriculum and instruction that could have well served in this position. I have quite a few parents that are not pleased with the decision that Governor Purdue made. Can she explain to the parents in Cumberland County what where her reasons for making such an appointment? Respectfully, A Concerned Parent

Subject: Cigarette Tax

Comment: I believe those of us who smoke have the right to choose to do it. With that being said, I would like to state my opinion that taxing cigarettes to pay for more free healthcare is very dishearting to those of us who work to pay taxes that already pays for free healthcare, welfare, food stamps etc. Bottom line in all of this is the working people (who smoke) are paying not only for our own insurance but paying 2 times (through taxes withheld from our paychecks and now cigarette tax)for all of those who choose to stay home and will still be able to smoke cigarettes because they have no other bills to pay...... When does it stop for the working class???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

> i am wondering if you, mr williams and i can meet with the school board official for our zone and also the superintendent of schools also i donot have their email address to request it so i am asking for your assistance.  I need to have Mr Williams to explain to me what his outcome of his interogation of my daughter without my permission and his ongoing efforts to bring this matter to some investigative point that i as a parent can understand about my child. I am still puzzled because when he hung up on me i just can't seem to get that unprofessional conversation out of mind when my child is involved and he was able to interogate her but could not answer my questions.. my daughter was again petrified of him sending for her to go to a gangone meeting that i again was totally unaware of. I donot trust his judgement at all if he can't talk to me then i certainly donot want him talking or making any decisions for my daughter without informing me. I know how you the administration feel for some kids but i am here to get answers and deal with this situation. again thanks T Tony Clark 704 930 4936

please use this reply:
Dear Mrs. Bishop,


Thank you for your e-mail regarding the issues you are experiencing with the Durham County Public Schools.  This response is on behalf of Governor Perdue.



I regret the problems you are experiencing with Jalin’s educational services. It appears from your e-mail message that you have contacted the appropriate local officials who can assist you with a resolution. You should know that when parents fail to agree with the school on appropriate educational services for a child with disabilities, they may file a formal written complaint with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction’s Exceptional Children Division. They will investigate allegations contained in the formal complaint.  A corrective action plan will be required when violations against a school system are confirmed in the investigation.  This process is a provision of federal law governing special education and is intended to be one way of resolving disputes between parents and school officials concerning the school system’s responsibility to provide a free and appropriate public education.



If you would like to file a formal written complaint, please send it to: Dr. Mary Watson, Director, Exceptional Children Division, 6356 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC  27699-6356. If you have any questions or concerns about the complaint process, you may contact Lynn Smith or Kate Neale, Consultants for Due Process and Parents’ Rights, at 919.807.3981. 



We appreciate your concern and willingness to be involved in your child’s education program.

To all it may concern:



Presently my son Jalin Carice Bishop is a third grader at CC Spaulding Elementary in Ms. Fonville’s class. Since day one in this classroom I have been displeased. I am now very ill to the point the doctor just revoked my license saying I may be a danger to others on the street and am unable to work. That is being said because I can not come sit in the class room and do the teachers job for her. I currently have four witnesses that deal with Jalin on a regular thanks to CC Spaulding that are willing to testify about the “what they call amendment to homework” and all the other in efficiencies that are going on in his class. His teacher yells and is very in appropriate. I have told the principal and everyone that I do not believe the teacher has the student’s best interest at heart. The EC teacher is often there with a condescending attitude. I am in tremendous amount amount of pain and all I want for my son is what is due to him a FREE APPROPIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION.



Today I write for another reason. Coach Drake called Jalin retarded yesterday and let him go back to class and not participate in P.E. His words were “That boy’s retarded”. I have three witnesses outside of my son that says he said it. My lawyer has legally advised me not to get into details with you all until you have done your investigation and to see what the out is.



I am sending this to every newspaper and everyone that I think can help. This generation is living in a history of yes we can. He may have autism but  yes he can participate in gym. He may not have the attention span as my other students but yes he can learn. This is a new day in America. No child is no longer being left behind or with out hope. I am stating that by any means necessary, we can, and we will form a plan that will turn this situation into a positive one. If this means my cane and me have to march up to the school so be it. If this means I have to call my governor to let her know to sub par education my son is receiving while my hands shake with pain, so be it. But I promise you Jalin Carice Bishop lives in the yes we can generation, no matter what some one says and justice will prevail.

re: MEDICARE PROVIDER NUMBER

Dear Governor Perdue:
I wrote you earlier asking for help with the above number so I can get an income to pay my employees and run the office.
This is a plea for help to secure this number. The banks with all the moneys given to them, refused me a secured loan to bridge the gap until I get this number.
By the end of next week I will pay my last payroll, close the only medical office on Emerald Isle, send all the employees to the unemployment office and I will have to file for bankruptcy.
I do beg for your help: my application number is 420100 and the person in charge of it at CMS is Kathy Chick at 615-244-5600  Ext.: 23832

Governor, please help us.

Governor Perdue,



Let me start by stating that I am a supporter and voted for you in November, I want you to succeed as our Governor. I am the Director of Group Sales at the Hilton in Wilmington which you have visited and was recently featured in the false "expose" reported by ABC news in Raleigh.



That story has hurt our business tremendously, many groups are now wanting to meet in locations less "luxurious" and off the radar. As you know, less travel means less revenue and less taxes paid by travelers and the employees of the hotel as well as all of the surrounding restaurants, shops and attractions.



MANY of the large associations that meet in Wilmington (and all over NC) consist of state Government Employees, with your recent travel freeze, we are now seeing conference attendance drop as much as 50% from previous years. I realize that you have good intentions with these cuts however, it is actually hurting the economy, not helping.



I beg you to find a middle ground and allow travel to conferences, we have too many employees that depend on hotel occupancy and without it, they do not work.



Thank you for your consideration,



Molly Johnson

 Dear Governor Perdue,

 I am writing this letter to offer support for Keith Werner to be
 appointed District Attorney for the Seventh Prosecutorial District.
 I have known him for sixteen years and I believe that he would definitely
 be the best choice for our district.

 Keith is a hardworking and loyal man who is an excellent role model for
 our community. Whether it is working with the Boy Scouts, volunteering on
 a mission trip, or helping those in trouble times he is one that can be
 counted on to be there giving his total time and attention.  These same
 qualities carry over into his professional career.  He has also been the 
 Assistant District Attorney for twenty years which makes him perfect for
 the job since he has so much experience.

 Thank you for taking the time to read this email and please do consider him
 for this position.


 Sincerely,

 Melissa Bynum

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am sending this e-mail to you to express my unqualified support for your appointment of Keith Werner as District Attorney for the Seventh Prosecutorial District. I started the practice of law with Poyner Spruill at about the same time that Keith joined the District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney under Howard Boney. I am not a criminal defense attorney;however, I have represented clients with minor criminal matters over the years, which allowed me to have professional interaction with Keith. I have nothing but the highest regard for Keith's legal abilities and ethics. Over the past twenty years, Keith has handled a number of high profile cases in which he has admirably represented the State. In addition to our professional dealings, I also know Keith personally and hold him in high regard. Keith's stepson and my son are in the same grade at school.  In closing, Keith has twenty years of experience as an Assistant District Attorney in this District; during those twenty years he has done an exemplary job in representing this State; he has paid his dues; and he deserves to be able to continue to serve the Seventh Prosecutorial  District as its District Attorney.  

Sincerely Yours,

Steve Rowe

and officials will discover how to:

**  Negotiate contract terms that stop problems before they start

     responsible for all customer service activities including managing the
     company's contact centers in the US, Europe, Japan, and India.

HWTF Commissioners:



As discussed on the conference call earlier this week, attached is a one-page document summarizing HWTF’s funding situation which you can use to communicate with key legislators.  The document can be used both as talking points as well as a handout to share in face-to-face meetings.  It would be especially helpful if you could talk with key House members, especially the Appropriations Chairs, since the House is currently working on the budget.  Please let me know if you need me to follow up with any additional information based on questions that come up during your conversations. 



We have received further clarification regarding the state spending restrictions and based on those we will need to postpone our Power of Prevention/Fit Community luncheon event.  We will either try to schedule it as a stand-alone event in early fall or couple it with the Commission meeting in November/December.  We will move ahead with selecting the Power of Prevention award winners at the Leadership and Planning call next week as originally planned. 



We will still have our full Commission meeting on Monday, June 1st  from 10 am to 12.30 pm – in light of the travel restrictions we will accomplish this via teleconference.  We will also be having all the Task Force meetings leading up to this full Commission meeting via teleconference.



Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you would like to serve on the new Mental Health Task Force chaired by Commissioner Jugta Kahai.  We would like to organize a meeting of this Task Force in late May.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

I hope your office does understand that the Governor serves the people of North Carolina.

What a shame that I cannot get answer to a question in regards to our military.  She, Beverly Perdue is Commander and Chief of the North Carolina Guard.



We have  4,000 guardsmen in the 30th, that are heading for Iraq. These soldiers have been training for 18 months.  These soldiers are sacrificing time with their families. The soldiers that she is denying the re-enlistment bonuses, have served this state for as long as she has.  There were families turned away at the ceremony.  Me and my family were part of them.  We ended up back at home.  Governor Perdue needs to give our families an explanation,as to how she can send our 30th Brigade over to Iraq, without honoring re-enlistment bonuses.  We received a letter from brigade and Raleigh Headquarters, that all soldiers would be getting the re-enlistment bonus.



She, and her staff needs to support us. She needs to budget enough money to support our soldiers and their familes.  She needs to honor the soldiers, with re-enlistment bonuses and honor the families with that. 



I am writing on behalf of several wives that are wondering why Governor Perdue has denied our husbands their rightful bonus.



Governor Perdue is the Commander and Cheif of the NC Guard.



We just want an answer, and a honest one.



LeAnne McEntire





   As Commander and Chief she should be aware of all her guardsmen. 



All we want is an explanation as to why she can not honor the letter stating that our guardsmen would be honored with the re-enlistment bonus.  



We would like to know if she knows how many guardsmen and their families she is denied re-enlistment bonuses for.



I am going to keep writing this letter until we get a response.



I am not going to quit, all we want is an answer.

Dear Neighbors,

I am reaching out to you this evening to share some information I have obtained regarding a recent policy change in Cary Park.  As you may or may not be aware, a letter was sent out to homeowners last week from CAS which included some information about the new pool rates.  In the middle of the back side of the page was a sentence regarding the new "Bring Your Own Beer" (BYOB) policy at the community pool unanimously approved by the Board and the Cary Park Pool Committee.

I was very concerned about this new policy and posted my concerns on our carypark.org site earlier this week.  I can not help but feel that a BYOB policy is blatantly irresponsible and negligent.  It puts the safety of our children in jeopardy and seriously questions our priorities as a community.   There were a few responses and Ken, as usual, took the time to address some concerns.  Unfortunately being told 'the lawyers think it is OK and CAS thinks it is OK so it is OK' is not OK with me so I have spent the past few days having lengthy discussions with representatives from the American Red Cross, the Wake County Department of Public Health-Environmental Services (regulates pools in Wake County) , and PPM, Inc and Omega, two of the larger property management companies in our area that represent all of our neighbors fom Amberly to Preston and dozens more.  (I have attached a list for your review.)

Bottom line, each and every individual was shocked.  They all agreed this is a dangerous policy and one that should never have been adopted.  The policy creates a substantial liability for the residents of Cary Park and degrades the integrity of this community.  Unfortunately this is just another example of poor management and decision making that has a significant impact on all of us.  Incompetence on the Board can no longer be tolerated.  We as residents need to be aware of what is going on.  These poor decisions adversely effect our property values and have a negative impact on the reputation of Cary Park.  Sadly one of the pool companies that was being considered actually turned us down due to the liability of such a policy.  This should have been a red flag.  Instead we went with a company that thinks this is OK? 

Furthermore, I have learned that PPM, Inc. has picked up six new communities since October, (including Greytone, Stonebridge, and Autumn Woods in Raleigh,) that have left CAS due to poor management and inexperience.  And we got a 25% rate increase..again approved????

Living in a community with an HOA frankly is tough.  We all have to work together and we have to make compromises and sacrifices for the best interest of the community.  Policies and changes to policies need to be seriously considered before we downgrade to such a degree.  Ironically we have downgraded so much and yet our rates keep rising...how does that work?  The Board must look at each and every decision with a broad view and recognize what is best for the entire community, not what is best for a few neighbors.  For the residents who feel a pool house bar and a BYOB are the same thing...they are not.  They are not even in the same league. I would ask you to think back when you were considering a home in Cary Park, when your realtor told you CP had a BYOB policy, what would you have thought about this community? 

Thanks for listening.  I greatly appreciate your time and hope you will share your thoughts and concerns regarding the policy change.
Sincerely,
Stacey Redgrave

Governor Perdue;
I strongly support the appointment of Keith Werner as the next District Attorney for the seventh district.
My 18 year old son accompanied Mr. Werner and other boy scouts on a 2 week hike in New Mexico last summer.Richard came home home impressed by his intelligence,integrity,wit,and vigor.
He has executed his current position as assistant DA with these same qualities.We would be fortunate to have him continue as our district attorney.
Thank you for your consideration.

I would like to express my sincere support for the appointment of Mr. Keith Werner as the next District Attorney 7th District.  I have known Mr. Werner for quite some time. This past summer I went on a 10 day 100 mile hike with him in the mountains of New Mexico, during which I learned something about Mr. Werner: he means business and he gets the job done.  What more could you possibly want from a Distrcit Attorney?

Thank you for your consideration,
Richard Deans

Your e-mail to the Governor's Office has, again, been forwarded to this office for a response.  As mentioned previously, you cannot apply for a pardon on a pending charge or a driving ticket or infraction.
If you can provide this office with the name of the individual you talked to, I will also speak with them regarding your request.

12th Annual Congressional Renewable Energy + Energy Efficiency EXPO + Forum



Cannon House Office Building – Caucus Room

U.S. House of Representatives

Independence Avenue and New Jersey Avenue SE

Washington, DC 20515



Thursday – May 14, 2009

9:30 am – 5:00 pm





WHAT



On May 14, the Sustainable Energy Coalition - in cooperation with Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Caucuses - will host the 12th annual Congressional Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency EXPO + Forum. 



This year’s EXPO will bring together more than fifty businesses, sustainable energy industry trade associations, government agencies, and energy policy research organizations to showcase the status and near-term potential of the cross-section of renewable energy (biofuels/biomass, geothermal, solar, water, wind) and energy efficiency technologies.  (A list of the participating exhibitors, to date, is provided below.)



Members of the U.S. Congress will offer welcoming remarks in the morning while afternoon speakers will discuss the role sustainable energy technologies can play in meeting America’s energy needs.



As Congress, the Administration, the business community, environmental advocates, and American voters search for options to address ways to stimulate the economy, “green jobs,” higher energy costs, increased reliance on energy imports, and the potential threat posed by rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions, the EXPO will help address the role that sustainable energy technologies might play. 



This will include not only the technical aspects of renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies but also related issues such as economics, jobs potential, environmental benefits, current and near-term market potential, model programs in the public and private sectors, and institutional, financial and legal barriers.



The EXPO is free, open to the public, and no RSVPs are required.



Even if you cannot attend yourself …



Please Share This Information with Members of Your Congressional Delegation as well as Other Businesses, Organizations, Government Officials, Academic Contacts, Members of the Media, and Interested Individuals.



WHEN



Thursday, May 14, 2009

9:30 am – 5:00 pm (exhibits open for viewing)

Dear Governor Perdue,
   I am writing in support of Keith Werner for your appointment as the DA for the 7th Prosecutorial District.  I am a small business owner here in Rocky Mount and Keith & his wife, Jan, have supported me over the years in my business, as well as Keith helping me on some issues as the Assistant District Attorney. There has been talk in our local paper over the past week suggesting that you appoint a black DA to fill Howard Boney's position, but I am asking you to please be color blind in your appointment, just as Keith is color blind in everything he does for this community.  If you will review Keith's resume, along with many letters of support for him that you have received, I believe that you will agree that his qualifications far exceed those of any other person you are considering for this position.  I know that he is the best man for this position & I will be praying for you as you review & interview each person seeking this position.!
Sincerely,
Lou Parker

Governor Perdue,
I am writing you in support of Keith Werner for the D.A. of Nash, Edgecombe and Wilson Counties.  I am a citizen of Rocky Mount, and very active in my Community as well as with the City of Rocky Mount.
  I formed the West Haven Community Watch group last summer, as we were experiencing a high number of break ins in our area.  Since it's inception, I have also been approached by two other neighborhoods in Rocky Mount, and have helped them form their Community Watch groups as well.  I work very closely with the Rocky Mount Police Department. in educating citizens about crime and preventative measures in keeping them safe.
  Although I am a republican, you did get my vote this year, after consultation with Sgt. At Arms/FOP Ricky Parks, as he assured me that you were the candidate that had law enforcement on her side.  I have taken the Community Watch to a higher level, and am now looking into the court systems, and what impact the community can have on the outcome of some of these cases.   We will shortly be starting a "Court Watch" group, that will regularly attend court cases to assure our officials are doing what they have been elected to do. With that in mind, I feel that Keith  Werner is the man we want as our D.A.  He has dedicated his time an effort to our area, and he should be rewarded.  He is the right man for the position.
   I have spoken with him yesterday concerning his position on crime in Rocky Mount, and we are on the same page.  He has assured me whether he receives the appointment or not, he will work with me and my Watch groups to assure that the bad guys are brought to justice.
Please give Keith your thoughtful consideration for D.A.

Sincerely,
Carole Reda
President
West Haven Community Watch

Dear Governor Perdue:

Attached are my CV and application to serve on the NC Board of landscape Architects.

While relatively new to North Carolina having moved here in 2006 to join the faculty at NCSU, I have become quite familiar with many registered landscape architects and the practice of this profession in this state.  As Head of the Department of Landscape Architecture at NCSU, which offers accredited programs in landscape architecture at both undergraduate and graduate levels, I am committed to ensuring that the education received by our students prepares them with the knowledge, skills, methods, and ethics to a practice that protects the health, safety, and well being of the public.  I believe my participation on the NC Board of Landscape Architecture will be mutually beneficial for our students and the profession as we face the challenges of studying, planning, designing, developing and stewarding landscapes to accommodate the needs and expectations of a growing constituency.

I would be honored to serve on this Board to contribute my expertise in the areas of landscape architecture to the benefit of the citizens of North Carolina.

Thank you.

Gene Bressler

I would like to urge you to support the proposal to elect the President by a national popular vote in all 50 states (H1270).


When we vote for every other office, the candidate who gets the most votes wins. It should be the same for President.

Thank you for your time.

To the Honorable Governor Beverly Perdue:

I am a 20+ year member of the workers' compensation community here in NC. I am writing to voice my support of Commissioner Diane Sellers' reappointment to the NCIC. Commissioner Sellers has been an invaluable asset to the NCIC, defense bar, plaintiff's bar, carriers, employers and employees alike. I feel that she is needed to help maintain some balance in the workers' comp system herein NC.

Thank you!

Dear Friends,



Most you of you have heard by now that District Attorney Howard Boney has announced he will step down from his position after more than 30 years.  You possibly have already received an email or you may be aware of the situation through the newspaper or other sources.  If by chance you have not been contacted please listen closely.  Governor Beverly Perdue will proceed to find a replacement quickly for the District Attorney’s position, either on an interim basis or with a permanent replacement by the end of April, 2009.



I am writing at this time to ask for your support of Keith Werner as our new District Attorney for the 7th District.  Keith has been employed as the Assistant District Attorney since 1989 and has been running the Nash County office.  His service and dedication has been unsurpassed over the years and is even more reason why Governor Purdue should give her blessings on Keith filling the position.  Keith is the most qualified to move directly into the office of the District Attorney for the 7th District.  He is already there and in place and the transition would be easy for all concerned.  Most of all he knows what he is doing and is one of the most trustworthy and dedicated public servants there is.



Keith and his wife Jan and their four children have lived in Rocky Mount for many years and they are very involved in the community, church and other endeavors to enhance Nash County.  I personally have known them a long time and that is one of the reasons why I am assisting to help on this is to make sure Keith will be appointed by the Governor.



Politics and parties aside, Keith deserves this position and has waited patiently for the day when Howard would announce his retirement.  Now that day is here we must make sure that not only Keith fills that position but that other people who are not qualified or are not deserving of the position would try to take his rightful legacy of the District Attorney’s office from him.  We are not saying anything against other reputable attorneys in our area but Keith Werner should be our next District Attorney.  The other reputable and distinguished attorneys should be looking to back Keith for this position instead of filing against him. We all know Keith will look for the best candidate out there to fill future positions.  It will not be based on age, race, or religious affiliation.   He will simply look for the best person to do the job.



Governor Perdue is going to make this decision soon so we need to act immediately.   Please send emails and letters to the Governor voicing your support for Keith Werner to be appointed to the position of District Attorney for the Seventh Prosecutorial District.  Below is her contact information.



Your involvement is for the future of our community, our families, and it is imperative we make sure Keith takes the position he so rightly deserves.  Thank you for your support in this very significant outcome for the future of Nash County.

My partners and I at STP Ventures, a Concord, NC based company, have designed a political website as a central location for the public to obtain information about all elected and appointed officials nationwide.  We have just returned from meetings in Washington with Guy Harrison of the NRCC and Gene Ulm of Public Opinion Strategies, who have communicated strong interest in the site.  

We plan to launch the site by the end of next week.  In order to increase viewership rapidly, we are offering 200 free profiles on the site for the duration of a year to each political party.  We are currently creating requested profiles for Republican leaders, but have not had the opportunity to meet with individuals from the Democratic Party.

Would you please contact me to arrange a short conference call, where I can give you a brief description of the site and a guided tour?  I believe you will be quite interested in what we have to offer.

I look forward to hearing back from you,

This is to be forwarded to the policy office.



I am writing to inform you of the horrendous plight of the elderly in North Carolina.





Many North Carolinian elderly have lost their Medicaid coverage because of the increase in social security benefits that took place in Jan 09.

I am a registered nurse who works for a home care agency in Asheville NC.

My concern is for the plight of the aged and infirmed who wish to stay in their homes as long as they can.





Many elderly in their 80’s and 90’s who wish to stay in their homes were receiving Medicaid under the Medicaid “Personal Care Services” program. The

Service was provided by Home care agencies.

Under this program if the qualifying persons on Medicaid required help with activities of daily living ( bathing, dressing, mobility, incontinence, bathroom  assistance) they could receive

up to 3 hours per day assistance (60 hours per month) total. Now due to the increase in social security that occurred in Jan 09 of approx $96.40 these elderly people no longer qualify for Medicaid and have lost the only life line to caring for themselves and in many case feeding themselves as well..



The home care companies are not getting informed that coverage has changed and thus not getting paid because of this .The only way the companies knew coverage has changed is when the company gets a rejected Medicaid bill from the state of NC. This is after service has been rendered for 1 month. About $1400. 00 per month.



As a nurse I had to contact all the clients who had their Medicaid stopped and tell them they do not qualify for home aide service any more. Some of these clients made only $2.00 over the limit to disqualify them for Medicaid. They cannot afford to pay for the care out of their own pockets. There is no one to make meals no one to bathe or dress them or help them walk around transfer from their wheelchairs. All live alone without any family or friends to help. (This is a requirement of the Personal care services program that there is no one else who can perform these tasks for them.) They are going to sit in their homes and some will die.

This is taking place right now in NC.



My question is … What will the state of NC do with all of these people?. When we have to stop care because of Medicaid loss no one is there to help with their bathing dressing toileting meal prep etc.. All they want to do is live in their own homes as long as they can. This program is a heck of a lot cheaper that government sponsored care facilities.

What a shameful event.. The Feds give them a raise that many elderly do not see.. but it’s enough to push them over the limit for Medicaid thus their loss of coverage.

Personal care Services is in many states in this country and will affect 100’s of thousands of old people.



Home care agencies are not being informed that Medicaid coverage has stopped. They have provided services paying the aide for as much as a month. The only way they find out is when the Medicaid payment is refused by the program. That agency is out 1 month service provided to the tune of 1400.00. When we contact Department of Social Services they tell us the client was supposed to notify us.

Let me assure you many clients do not understand that the coverage was stopped or why. Others are so desperate they will not report it for fear of not receiving help with basic living needs. Again I repeat basic living needs.



There was reference that this may happen on the internet in 2005 but government offices were supposed to address the issues so exactly what has happened would not. I refer you to

<http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=432>http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=432.







Please have these folks re-instated in Medicaid or at least grandfather them in..





Thank you

Dear Governor Perdue,

 I am sending this e-mail in support of Keith Werner to fill the position of District Attorney of the Seventh Prosecutorial District being vacated by DA Howard Boney.  As you are aware Keith has been the Asst. District Attorney since 1989, giving him the experience needed for this important job.  Mr. Werner does not fall into the position of a selection based off race or political heavy weight favoritism, as he is just the best candidate for the job with the best experience.  I thank you for considering Mr. Werner and taking the time to address the concerns of the citizens of this district.

Kindest regards,

Keith Ballentine

The Governor’s Office has requested that I respond to your letter regarding speaking with someone about the possibility of introducing gaming machines, like video poker, into the offerings of the North Carolina Education Lottery.



Currently the NCEL does not have statutory authority to operate such machines.  In fact, there are multiple bills that have been introduced in this session of the Legislature dealing with this very issue.  We believe you are better served to take up this issue with members of the Legislature.



Thank you for your interest in the NCEL.
