Dear Mr. Jones,

Your email to the Governor’s website regarding a contact in the Governor’s Office for the National Guard has been referred to this office for response.

Other than the Adjutant General for the North Carolina National Guard, Maj. Gen. William E. Ingram, Jr, there is no specific contact in the Governor’s Office for the National Guard.  The telephone number for Gen. Ingram is 919-664-6101.

There is a contact in the Governor’s Office for the military in general.  That contact is Ms. Ann Lichtner.  She can be contacted at 919-801-3932.

I trust you find this information helpful.  If you should need further assistance, please fee free to contact me at 919-664-6013.

I am looking for a contact in the Governor's office for the NC National Guard. Not a recruiter but a political position in the Governor's office.

Thanks
