	Message: 	Dear Governor Easley,

Imagine the surprise the Sampson County community had when they read this article in the Sampson Independent, published December 31, 2008. http://www.clintonnc.com/articles/2008/12/31/news/doc495b7c9bc3563737964538.txt

Imagine our further surprise when we read this explanation, “The fiscal department said that until every agency across the state had turned in the reports ‘correctly,’ then no money would be dispersed,” Gonzalez reiterated, adding, “There are a hundred agencies, and if for any reason, just one hasn’t turned it in right, then no one gets paid.”

Now Governor, I ask you, are you running a kindergarten? It certainly seems that you are running your department using kindergarten rules? These are state funds that were applied for and approved by the state for the continued running of domestic violence shelters and clinics throughout the state. These are not cookies to be withheld at snack time because an errant child forgot to wash his hands.

U-Care has filled out the mandatory paperwork, submitted the paperwork on time, and the paperwork is correct and complete. Yet, your Department of Administration (fiscal) is going to withhold desperately needed funds because some other group has not filed theirs correctly? Would this go over well with you if the Internal Revenue Service withheld your personal refund because some man in California didn’t file his taxes correctly? Would you withhold clothes, food and shelter to a group of people in Area A because someone in Area B was not seated? This is exactly what you are doing and in doing so you have shown the Sampson County community that your office implements infantile and childish regulations.

You are familiar with domestic violence. You would have to be in order to function in your job. So, my telling you that every day you withhold the funds that U-Care qualified for and should currently have in hand to operate the shelter with, is a day that you are risking the life of a man, woman or child who is desperate to escape a domestic violence situation is something you should already know. Domestic Violence does not stop because the funding is ceased or delayed. In fact, it escalates. It escalates because there is no one left to stop it. You are also aware that incidents of domestic violence increase with the stress of the holidays, the lack of personal finances (we are in a recession and money is tight at all economic levels) and during times of unemployment (North Carolina reports a 7.9% unemployment rate which is the highest level since 1983). All of these factors are currently in play not only in Sampson County, but throughout the state. Now is not the time t o punish domestic violence victims through the withholding of funds.

There are 100 counties in the state and most counties have a shelter of some type or at least a shelter agreement with a neighboring county. With delayed funding, how many shelters will have to close? How many will have to refer to another county? How many closings will the Department of Administration deem acceptable? Is 1 thru 5% acceptable? How about 15 to 25%? Nothing more than 0% should be acceptable to your office and to the citizens of this state.

U-Care is an essential service in our community and without them I really do not know where I would be. In December 2000 I ran from my abusive husband with two children, two cats and a Golden Retriever. I ended up in Clinton because that is basically where the U-Haul ran out of gas. My family resided at U-Care for 63 days and during that time we were counseled, respected and loved. Since then, with the support of U-Care, I have completed a degree in Criminal Justice and will graduate in May 2009 with a degree in Paralegal Technology. I am 100% certain that my family would not have survived this trauma without the guidance and dedication of this wonderful group of professionals and there is not a day that I don’t recognize their influence on my life and the lives of my children. As such I advocate for this organization whenever I can.

Again, Governor Easley, I cannot emphasize enough how the delay in these funds due U-Care will impact their organization and our community. This delay is literally a recipe for disaster in the making. What happens to that one victim who cannot find help locally? What happens to her children and family if she returns to the home and is beaten, yet again, or shot or murdered? Is the withholding of funds until “everyone does it correctly,” worth that one life?



Thank you,

Janet Rogers

We can’t access the original article, but the fact is that the funds have indeed been released. I don’t know what source provided incorrect information. How about if I just call her?

Jill,

 I have followed up on this inquiry with our Grants Administration Office. We do not have nor have we had any funds on hold for Sampson County.  This is absolutely incorrect, erroneous information.   Domestic violence first and second quarter have been dispersed.
