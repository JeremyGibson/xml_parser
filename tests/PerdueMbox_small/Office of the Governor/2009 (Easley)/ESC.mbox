	Message: 	Dear Governor,

My name is Leslie Darrin Lovelace and I am a Rutherford County resident. My employer has sent in benefit claims 3 weeks in a row and I have not received payment. The last payment I received was issued on 12/11 and nothing since. In the meantime, I've had to rely on credit cards which needless to say is increasing my debt. I've contacted all the neccessary people with the ESC both local and Raleigh and getting vague explanations. Please help me in any way you can and I thank you in advance.

Yours Truly,
Leslie Darrin Lovelace

Allison,

This one came to us from the governor.office email.  The issue was
delayed resolution of the claim.  Mr. Sevigny's claim was  adjudicated
effective 1/1/09.  He was ruled ineligible for three (3) weeks because
of receiving severance pay.  Benefits have already been released and the
claim is current.

Thank you for the inquiry concerning the status of Diana Hyde's claim
for Unemployment Insurance.  A representative from the ESC Remote
Services Center contacted her and is assisting her with setting up her
claim using the New York wages.

Governor Easley,
I recently lost my job due to an illness. I was out of work, and they
fired me because I missed too much time. That was on Dec. 16th. I
applied for unemployment. Of course because I was fired I was not
guaranteed unemployment. When I contacted the local Greensboro branch of
the ESC they told me it could take 4-6 weeks before I had a decision on
my unemployment. When I contacted the Raleigh office they told me it
could take 10 weeks before I had a decision. I am not married, and I do
not have any family that can help me financially. I had a decent job and
I was able to pay my bills. No one is hiring right now, and I do not
have savings. What am I supposed to do in the 4-10 weeks it takes for
them to make a decision about whether I deserve unemployment? How am I
supposed to pay my rent or utilities? I have worked since I was 15, and
I am 27 now. I have paid taxes for 12 years, and now when I need my tax
dollars to help me, I cannot get them. By the time they even make a
decision on my unemployment I am going to be homeless. I need help or a
suggestion. I have applied for food stamps, and am waiting on a decision
but that can take up to 30 days. The department of social services will
not help with my electric because I do not have a minor child living
with me. What am I supposed to do? Where are the programs to help me
that my tax dollars have gone to support for the last 12 years? Please
feel free to call me or email me with any suggestions? Thank you in
advance for your time. Amie L Hodges
