Mr. Lowry –

I apologize for the belated response to your request. The Council of State did indeed meeting at 9:00am on Tuesday, January 6th in the Commission Room #5034 of the Administration Building located at 116 W. Jones Street in Raleigh. However, I have included a listing of the 2009 meeting dates for your future reference.  The standing meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month in the Commission Room of the Administration Building. I have also included a copy of the agenda that was discussed at the January meeting. The official minutes will be available at the February 6th meeting for approval.  If we can be of further assistance, please let us know. Thank you.

Debbie Young

I have heard that the Council of State is scheduled to meet sometime on Tuesday, January 6, 2009. I cannot however find an agenda or confirmation of this meeting on the State Government website. Can you tell me if the Council of State will indeed be meeting on the 6th of January, if there is an agenda that can be provided to me and if the meetings are open to the public, and if so, where the meeting will be held?

Thank you for your early reply to my inquiry.
