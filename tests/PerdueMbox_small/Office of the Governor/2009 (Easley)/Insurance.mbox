Ellie,



We also received this from Senator Goss’ office via Vicky Young this morning too. Attached is a copy of my letter to Ms. Elledge. I emailed it to her and sent it regular mail.

Ellie,



Embarq is Self-Insured. I can send her a letter referring her to the US Department of Labor regarding the benefits but I don’t know who she would contact regarding what was or is offered to retirees. She may need an attorney if she has documentation of the agreement mentioned below.

Hi, Ellie.  This went first to DHHS.  It appears to be an Insurance issue.



Thanks.
A.

My name is Heather Elledge. In 1989 I went to work for a company named Centel Telephone. In 1995 it was bought out by Sprint, and a few years ago a portion of the company was purchased by Embarq. In 2002, I suffered a hypertensive stress induced stroke which rendered my left leg paralyzed. Under the terms of the agreement, the company was suppose to continue to provide health insurance until retirement age. This year Embarq decided to change that and my premiums which have been $30 p er month has now increased to $630 per month. Because this is an old Centel benefit that I paid for it will be very difficult to fight. Meanwhile Embarq's CEO continues to enjoy his very large 6 digit salary plus benefits. I am, just as all long term disability recipients are, on a very fixed income. So now I have to decide whether I can provide a roof over our head or health insurance. It is sad that companies are allowed to harass the disabled. A group of people who truly have no options. It is not like I can try to do anything....I can't work. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. My email address is <mailto:elledgehome@aol.com>elledgehome@aol.com and my home address is 701 Sunset Strip Rd North Wilkesboro, NC 28659, (336)696-9850. Thank you very much for your time.
