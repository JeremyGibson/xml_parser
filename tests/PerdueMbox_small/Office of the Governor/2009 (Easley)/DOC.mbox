Dear Governor Easley,I have attached a letter in word format for you to read since it is rather long. I know that it will be someone in your office, rather than you personally, because that is how it usually works. I'm ok with that as long as someone will actually acknowledge me and try to help me. Thank you so much for your time. I will also call to make sure this was received.

Happy Holidays.

** High Priority **



Dear Ms. Stephenson:

Your recent email to the Governor's office has been referred to my office for response.

First of all let me say thank you for your kind letter on behalf of Inmate Taylor.  He came into our system on December 20, 1999 with a 24 year and 9 month sentence and his projected release date is November 4, 2019.  He was sentenced under the structured sentencing act which mandates that the offender serve at least 100% of the minimum sentence and 85% of the maximum sentence.  Therefore, he must serve his sentence to completion.  His current projected release date is November 04, 2019.  There is no parole. This date is subject to change if he earns or loses time credits through the Division of Prisons.

Under our constitutional system, the Executive and Judicial branches of government are separate and distinct.  As head of our state, the Governor nor the Secretary of Correction has any jurisdiction to investigate a court matter or intervene in a judge's decision.

However, if you feel Inmate Taylor is innocent, you may wish to contact one of the following agencies to determine if they are able to assist you:

If you have further questions you may reach me at 1-800-368-1985.

Sincerely,

Janice King

 Thanks you, Governor Easley, for the opportunity to bring my request to your attention. I'll be as brief as possible.
My nephew Charles Franklin Taylor, II, inmate #0673462, has been incarcerated since 1999, and has never been into trouble. He is in the facility at Nashville, N.C. Frankie, was convicted of murdering a man whose last name was Taylor, but no relation. He was guilty. Please let me tell you a little about Frankie.
He was a senior in high school at the time and working as much as sixty hours a week. His Mother and Father had not lived together for many years, yet communicated with each other and kept his home life in turmoil. Frankie lived with his Father, my brother, who is now deceased. During his working hours, he met a women who had recently moved to Smithfield from Texas. She gave him the kind of attention he had not known before.
Frankie didn't have proper guidance at home so he put his earnings into the women's home and spent time with her. At the time of the murder, Frankie had worked so much and gone to school, he'd had no sleep and was not thinking clearly. (He couldn't say no when he was asked to work for Pepsi in Selma.) Frankie went by her house late that night. He saw her former boyfriend's car there. He went home, got his hunting gun, went back to her house and shot the man, in the bed, with buckshot. Then he went home and told his Father what he had done. He asked his Dad if he thought he had killed him. His Daddy said, yes, and told him to get ready because the sheriff would be there soon.
Frankie had never been into any trouble, never even a fight. He never drank, not even beer. He was and still is a wonderful young man who made a horrible mistake that can not be changed.
Because of the dead man's mother's request to the court, Frankie was sentenced to an extremely long term. It is twenty to twenty-four years with no parole.
We want you to know that Frankie is loved and we want him home. I blame the circumstances of his home life. He wanted then and still wants a home and family, children with chubby cheeks.
He has a place to live with my husband and me for as long as he wants and a job.
PLEASE, HELP FRANKIE!!

FYI -I called Ms. Simone (aka Furlough) today and informed her that her concerns were turned over to the Division of Community Corrections and that they had completed their investigation. I also informed her that while I could not provide her any specific details regarding the outcome she was welcome to call DCC at a later date (suggesting she wait until a new director is in place). I also gave her our toll-free number if she had any questions about her husband's incarceration.  She seemed receptive and thanked me.

Subject: re:probation info




     I am the ex-wife and mother of James Winder Privette 2nds children,currently being held in the Beaufort County Jail in Wahington North Carolina on pending charges. I am not condoning what James has done or what he has done in the past,but I feel and his parents feel this could of all been avoided.

     James was put on probation for past charges in Nash County (Nashville Nc Probation Office) his probation officer at that time was Ms. Lori Battle that was on or about 11/12/2004 . james was on probation for obtaining property -worthless checks in Martin and Washington counties and also a misdemenor B&E in martin countywhich he recieved 36 months of probation . During that time James was on probation he left the county and came to Jamesville,Nc which is in Martin countyhe took up residence and started working I called Ms Battle and spoke to her and informed her whenre he was staying and she said she would check into it Nothing was done and on 8/18/05 James was arrested for Drving with license revoked , ficticious information to the officer and resisting arrest. James was taken to Bertie -Martin Jail in Windsor NC until he was convicted on 8/31/05he recieved and active sentence of maximum of 4 months. Ms Battle went to the prison in Swanquarter from what James told me and spoke to him . James was released from the prison on 12/23/05, walked out wasnt picked up for violation of probation or anything.

     After that time he came back to Jamesville NC talked with me and he started messing with drugs again.I called the probation in Nash County again to let them know where he was at this time i was told that they would check into it.During this time I waited and James took off and went to  Houston,Texas to the rehap center the ARC Salvation Army center where he did really well and was clean from 2/06 to about 3/07.I found out that in March of 2007 James was back in North Carolinahe was paying child support at $100.00 a week (not the court order) but it was a start. I talked to him and found out that he was around the wrong people again and he was using again so ,I called the probation office in Nash County North Carolina and was informed that James had a new probation officer , Officer Jones I told him where James was and we talked about his drug problem and his probation he told me he was going to talk to the head officer in charge and to call him back in a few days. I did he told me that they were in the process of getting the paper work so they could pick him up. Nothing again was done , he was back in Spring Hope NC and he couldnt even pick him up . Again James took off and went back to Texas to the rehap center  this was June of 2007 Officer Jones had three months to pick him up , but didnt. I called Officer Jones in July of 2007 and told him he was in texas but he told me that there was nothing that they could do because his charges werent severe enough to extradite him back to North Carolina that was in september of 2007.

      I communicated with James through email and let Officer Jones know that he was back in North Carolina in May of 2008 he was staying with a friend a pastor in Jamesville,NC  again Officer Jones said they were getting the paper work to send to Martin County , James contacted my child support worker and was making his court ordered payments and working and seeing his kids and going to church . My childsupport worker had him served for back child support of 14,000 dollars and the officers went right to the house where he was staying at and thats it . Between these times I called the DOC number posted on his offender profile online and let them know of his wehreabouts I was told each time they would contact James probation officer, nothing was done.

     James got messed up again on drugs again in February of 2008 he went to the ARC rehap center this time in Florida he stayed gone for about 3 months . I called the DOC number again and they said they would inform James probation officer again , again Nothing. James retruned back to NC again in May of 2008 he did ok for a while took the boys on vacation to the beach with people  I could trust and worked and paid his child support again he started acting funny not answering his phone and not going to work , I heard from a friend that in October of this year actually October 14th he was being sought by crimestoppers for a felony 1st degree arsonand breaking and entering in Beaufort county and Martin county as well as larceny in both counties.

     I called crimestoppers in both Beaufort and Martin and was told by Beaufort county investigator Wesley Waters that they were going to let Martin county handle it since he resisided in Martin County. So I called Martin County crimestoppers where I was given the number for Detective Drew Robinson I called him and told him James was at the Stewart street address in Jamesville,NC he said that he would get an officer to watch the house . Still he wasnt arrested , about a week at the 14th of October incident James signed his self into the rehap center in Greenville,NC (Walter B Jones) I called Detective Robinson and let him know that he had checked into the rehap center in Pitt County he informed me that they would check on it. James called me on November 25 2008 at about 10 pm he wanted me to bring our youngest son Christopher to see him I told him it was too late and Christopher wasnt feeling well he then was teeling me all  of the mediceine that the doctors had put him on in Pitt County and I told him I thought he was being prescribed too much because he was slurring and talking all out of his head.I hung up with him and the next morning Novemeber 26th  I called Detective Robinson and let him know that he was back again in Jamesville,NC at the Stewart Street address where i have let all law enforcement know where he was from the beginning, I was told that he was going to have and officer again watch the house. Not long after James called me from the house on Stewart Street and asked me why I sent the cops around there I told him that I  didnt know what he was talking about he said they were just there banging on the door but that he didnt answer. I left a message for Detective Robinson on his cell that James was in the house and he was there when the officers went to the door and he didnt answer that James had called me no sooner did the officers leave and wanted to know why I sent them there again he wasnt picked up. I called Detective Robinson on the 28th of Novemeber about 9 in the morning i told him that i left a message for him that James was there when he sent the officers to the house and he had called me and wanted to know why I sent them , he said that they had got him early that morning on the 28th and that he had taken a bunch of pills and resisted and was taken to the hospital and on the way he went into cardiac arrest and coded on the way but the paramedics got him back, he also told me that for me giving him the infomration I gave him that he would talk to the man at crimestoppers about getting me some money for the information i gave him.

     When I called crimestoppers I was told my tip wasnt the one that got him arrested Which I dont think was right or fair I have told everlaw enforecement officail where James was at all times .

     james is a good person and a smart person when he is clean I believe after being married to him for 14 years that this could have been prevented if the probation officer in Nash County would have done their job and picked him up.I beleive he would of never got caught up in these charges . So now my children have to suffer through the holidays without there dad and have a bad christmas, because someone failed to do their job, when he could of spent a little time in prison versus what he is facing now.As far as crimestoppers I gave the officers all the information they needed and for me trying to help them and help James I get nothing James gets more time and the boys lose their father for I dont know how long.

     James has a history since he was sixteen years old of mental problems and trying to kill hiself he has been to Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro NC 3 times and the psychiatric hospital in Nash County by Nash general Hospital he has been in trouble with the law since he was a teenager. I had him involuntarily committed with the help of a Martin county sheriff sometime in 2000 and he tried to kill hiself 2 more times by overdosing on pills or drugs. 

     So what happens now ? I believe if Officer Jones would of picked him up instead of telling me the paper work was being processed waiting for it toobe signed ..... or why was he let out of prison after he broke probation .... and why did the officers wait so long to get a warrant to arrest him when they knew where he was the entire time, What kind of hep is he going to get in prison?

     I didnt do this as a bitter ex-wife I did ti so my sons could have a dad that they were never able to have before, because of the drugs and mental problems. as far as the crimestoppers tip I wasnt trying to benefit myself I was giving the information to them so that they could get him off the streets before he would hurt himself.Like I said all of this could of been prevented , as far as the money from crimestoppers that I never got it wasnt for me it was for my sons Christmas so at least I could say they got something from their dad .
