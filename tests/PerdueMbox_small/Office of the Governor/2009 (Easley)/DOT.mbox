Dear Ms. Mezo:

Your email to the Governor's office was forwarded to me for response. I checked with the NCDOT maintenance office for Durham County and was told Pearson Drive is not a state-maintained road. That means any possible restrictions regarding signs such as you suggest would be up to the owner of the road. We suggest you contact the city of Durham's Street Maintenance office (560-4312, between hours of 7:30 AM and 4:00 PM) to see if your road falls under its jurisdiction, and if so, what it might be able to do to help your situation. If it is not a city-maintained road, then it is a private road, and you would have to determine who is the owner or owners.

In regard to dealing with the dumping of trash in your area, that is a criminal offense. You may want to contact the Durham city police with your concerns, as only a police agency can charge an individual with littering.

Sincerely yours,

Steve Abbott
NCDOT Communications Officer

Dear Governor Easley,
I want to know if I can get permission to put a sign on the property near my home so that people stop dumping or throwing trash there. It is often that I find fast food cartons and other trash thrown close to my property. If there would be a stae fine added to a sign on the property to make these persons responsible for their actions it would help. Please, assist me. I am tired of picking up other people's garbage. Thank you.
