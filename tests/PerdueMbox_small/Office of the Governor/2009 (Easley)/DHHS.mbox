Problem


First allow me to say thank you for taking the time to read my Housing Grant request.

My name is Sharon Robinson,

I'm writing to you because I desperately need a housing grant. My problem isn't something that just now becoming and issue, it's been from years of damage, bad credit, low income and or mental stability. Me and my 3 girls under 18 live here in Bolton, NC now for 32 yrs, which is on private land if I ever need to place a new home onto, given by my mother and father. My income situation is below $16,000 coming from SSI/Disabilty I have Bipolar. I have tried my hand in working to clear my credit and working with home health agencies but my sickness of Bipolar usually gets me fired.

I have tried to apply with many agencies ranging from the Guaranteed Loan Program, USDA, DREAM CENTER (BROKEN PROMISES FROM THEM ALL THE TIME), HUD, MERCI, CLAYTON MOBILE HOMES, OAKWOOD, HOME HEADQUARTERS and so on, all of the mobile home dealers just say I need a cosigner or pay cash which is impossible for me to do.

Solution

I'm asking for a housing and land grant that'll will provide us with a livable home with central heating and air the housing/land grant will aide in clearing the wooded land that I'm now living on, and provide a safer landscape instead of muddy swampy land which surrounds us now me and my 3 kids. It'll give us a more sanitary septic tank system which is included with the house package, my sewage now goes onto the ground and it's very embrassing and unsanitary, for us all. Me and 2 of my girls have asthma, so the mold, mildew, insects of all kinds coming in from the hole in the floor, which I did my best to repair. But still rats and black lizards, etc., still come through the cracks from it, as well as water everytime it rains making it harder for my front door to remain closed.

My 2 bedroom trailer, caught on fire in 1994, burning the furnace to the core, along with the A/C unit which is connected with it. I don't have any insurance on my trailer, I just can't afford it at this time, so it's been hard trying to pay my light bill because using the electric space heaters runs my light bill up over $300 or more monthly so I can only pay the past due amount which is just adding on late charges bringing my balance up higher then before. My trailer have surges at least 5x's weekly, lights going off on there on, the space heaters melts through my outlets so I have to use my oven and stove tops, to heat myself and my kids throughout the cold weather. This is very hard on my girls asthma and health otherwise, because cold weather contributes to this sickness like the mold, mildew, excess trees, and chipped paint falling from my ceilings. The list just goes on, there doctor at Knox Clinic even wrote me a letter about the affects of how these conditions harm our healt h, back in 1994 when I was still requesting a housing grant. I feel I can't and won't give up until I provide a safer living environment for me and my girls.





Funding requirements


The amount that I am requesting is between $40,000 to $80,000 which will include land clearing, new septic system which mine is over 25 or more years old. It'll provide us with a safer new home without me being afraid of sleeping in because of shortages in the outlets melting and going out most of the time. This amount was given to me by Home Headquarters and being that I have land to place it on would be even easier. I can afford everything after that just need help getting my feet in the front door first, I could never have enough resources to save for a down payment, my credit is always denied if I don't have a huge down payment.

I am recently divorced a mother of a six year old. I was raised in NC and moved back home after 13 years of marriage and living in GA. I returned to the small town known as home to me to raise my daughter. I'm just looking for a 'leg up'. I moved in with my mother in hopes of finding a job in NC and getting a place of our own. After a year I still live with my mom finding a job is still not happening. What I want to know is where do I apply for the Gov. grants and help?
