Digging All the Way to China and Then Some  FULL VERSION – closed 4:13 EST 1/1/09


3:35 EST 1/1/09 – the coming 60 minutes interview looks interesting.  -  what is reen for the gander apparently is not green for the Austiran Goose who seems to be having a tought time being green compared to others -   Hard to have enough plastic explosive to take it through screening 100 times – some gov't waste jobs are more popular than others.  BTW by the way are screeners unionized – just checking  -China's UN security council gift is ivory – What if the other elephants don't respect you ?   OR Does orphanage help the ivory industry?  - make it more efficient – can kill mohter and dub grows up – or if you let the cubs die off – the poachers would have to place higher limits on themselves – essentially the nursery is a slaughterhouse if you think about it – rearing calves and geting them ready to be slaughtered later – helps the poachers – whereas the nautral deaths of the cubs would eliminate the elephant herd in wild and curtail poaching as there would be no many-  if poachers wanted to cull tusks – THEY would have to raise the elephants and pay – right now essentially people like me or people who give money to save the elephants – someone supports that camp - - they assist the poachers  by growing the next stalk of elephants for them and the people who love elephants are paying for their execution.  - Again apparently these interviews are old – because somneone forgot to post 12/21/08  broadcast in the usual spot – it was the holidays of course and I could understand how that might happen – but it was in the popular videos and I found it there.   Mr Rooney would the $50 Free gift cards that are on computer banner ads if you just sign up to try magazines or whatnot from different products.   - thinking back th being a mystery shopper – and the furniure store in North fayette oddly my assignment involved buying and returning a gift using car pickup – I didn't have a car  - and geting a meal in their cafeteria – I did manage to carry and roll the cabinet of a sort wasn't it back to the store and get my money- it sized to be hard to do that manually of course because it was for car pickup – and even though I did do this for IKIEA – swedish meatballs back at you – they never did pay me claiming the assignment was done improperly – which technically it probably was- but maybe it was set up to be problematic to always justify not paying me – someone must have laughed a lot with my whole mystery shopping experience – I was out $100 or more from the automatic charges that got added to my credit card through a mystery shopping site – monthly recurring fees – one from onlingo – and one from a science someone – both appeared to be free or with a $5 shipping cost.   Never found an assignment that was easy or the right fit for me – why does it sound so Pittsubrgh that it happened like that.   - But getting you hooked in – seems to be an important of retail BECAUSE if you had any good sense you wouldn't buy the product in the first place.  Again your coming stories on CMU doing a mind reading study – which a gremlin use to help pinpoint what it though – my thoughts haven't been private for years it appears – the drunk driving which is not murder, but apparently bein prosecuted that way  – and Lubbock is in the news on 60 minutes how interesting.    - Jail time seems to be rising the whole sex offender thing and stories like the drunk driving – I forgot that story had to look it up – could not remember easily without looking it up – a hole in my memory – but more and more – either you are a good person in good social standing Or if you screw up in any way- your life is shattered and there is no getting it back and it is rahter odd how the trend of not rehabilitation and full societal participation for ex-offenders, but instead the laws are making it harder for them to reintegarate into society and making it easier to quickly sort society into two tiers-  odd and troubling that – because that defacto makes it easier to control the people in the first tier of society – and that's odd too – Bill Gates retired – saw it on jib jab. 

polish person in times square for last this news report that I hear this 2008 20:32 Est 12/31/08

tongue blister right side of tongue – upper. 

20:00 Est kfyo  – blue hats for top hats in Nyc – Democrats are blue  – was that the color of 1865?  - caged dog watchign you with a lambchop - - but I don;t want to be in NYC right now – I learned my lesson on “perfection of NYC”

elian gonzalez is a tough – yes the mother wanted her son here – it appears – the father did not – we don't like cuba – it is a different way to govern – if it was your son and like a coutnry on a non-European continent kept your son as a father – would that be okay with you?  - your relatives would have more parental rights than you do?  - Father has closest tie to child – not mother – pardon me – the mother is dead – father has closest tie to child not the remaining family – why do we have a right to force our way of life on another family – the mother cannot speak for the father – in this country if the mother did that and deprived the father of the child – what would happen – even here she would be decalred unfit for kidnapping the child and the father would get custody – mother spoke for the child without father's consent -

son threw away wrapping of mother's gifts and lsot lottery ticket - ya know at DAM there was this guy when I had to pick up the trash - he told me once he found a $50 bill taped to part of the trash - and it's a game to make you be more careful - and again it is manipulation because of course in my case there never was any $50 bill or anyhting of any worth - they bated me to get me to look at what they wanted-  like the thrown away Pittsburgh journal listed all the architecture firms - in that issue - and they wanted me in archtiecture and I said no - And I am very glad I did not go in - or back in - it's not what I wanted and you had no right do be like - go in or we'll harass you to death - as for the mother and her son - sounds like a good reason to abolish christmas presents altogether and get back to the true meaning of Christmas which has nothing to do with the presents-  ti would stop things from getting lost and stop bitchy old women and men and young bitchy women and men from playing games with the gifts they give people - so I like they idea of no gifts personally - I'll buy my own gifts thank you.   DAM was good at promisin something good would happen in the future to get you to work harder and then never coming through on that.  Not there anymore – and soon I may never have to deal with them again – unless they will pay me alimony of a sort from now on. 

kfyo – don't drink too much  - before New Year's Eve- before you go unless yo uare wearing depends – that is an odd thing for a new years eve reveller to say – I have bladder issues this days – do find it interesing.  - 61 degrees for a low ? 19:00 EST 12/31/08

replacegunswithpeashooters.com – what's wrong with that-  it's a joke by the way – it would never happen – right? 

 I  tried to be a cartoonist - had a cartoon in the Tartan at CMU - was rejected by the syndicates for the papers - three times each syndicate - I did 3 mailing to at least 5 syndicates - and CCAC would not publish my cartoon and in 2005 CMU editorial staff wouldn;t publish either - and they did in 2004 - - I was an alumni obht times and they have an open publish - publish anything policy - cannot be rejected for content - maybe obscene words - but they do not select strips - they have a polciy agaisnt that-  if you want it - you get in - that did not happen with me in 2005 - it did in 2003and 2004 - - there were incidents with the new editior in 2004 - he tried to block a strip on poor drawing and I got around it the first time - but in 2005 - they just didn;t respond to emails- so I emialed - the CMU has a President not a chancelllor - Pitt has a chancellor - but my cartoon was banned in an open publish paper - probably for politics - but they don't do that - that is what is funny.   - I did look at dilbert's pages on getting syndicated – on his site dilbert.comn – he says and shows his original drawings – and that he drew 50 of them – 50 strips which is a lot of work – but he couldn;t draw – it encourages peopel to try – but send a lot of strips – even if badly drawn – kinwoing what i know now – send fewer and draw them better – first impression is important – AND – you don;t want them to see your material - - he is helping the syndicates and lying potentially as much as warren buffet does – with his pages for syndication – he had an in – to get in – he doesn't say that-  he shows poorly drawn strips and the rejection letters and then talks about the acceptance phone call – like other things I heard – like DAM – it is fixed – I did find out on my won – the syndicates are fixed – I now email several of them or related companies. 

dilbert is destructive – the cartoonists are all leftists – even outland brethed betrayed me – dilbert is a problem – yuppo cartoon – appeals to yuppie abused office worker who does not want to realize he or she has trapped themselves – it feeds the feeling of trappedness – does not motivate people to change things – coughing up phlegm.  Doonesbury – ARRRRGGGHHHHH

midland police put videos on youtube – um no – use calls solicited from youtube vidoes of crimes to catch people – No that will get gamed – somehow-  make your own website- do not use the youtube website- you have – OH – here's one – you immediately set those 15 year old's up for black mail – Bill Gates get a hold  see – I can't rmemeber it's name – in 2001 – a movie -   18:35 – are a person with strong sense of patriotism – after this year I think this coutnry is nuts – the cia ad is going again -  - I ahd to look – antitrust “2001” - it appears Bill gates and maybe others blackmail people with criminal histories – so Texas shouldn't go publishing 15 year-olds with a record online-  they'll make good slaves via blackmail for gates and everyone will know who they are – Anittrust APPEARS to be about Bill Gates and how to use people – control people – to get anything you want- the blackmail scene is the girlfirend later in the movie- she had a criminal past and was blackmailed into being his girlfirned to watch him. 

I know nothing on sports stats – i didn't even know players at all  I didn't even what superbowl it was or is.  Until i was forced to watch it. 

Is Ink for you if you are against Republcians in the Austin Newspaper a REAL ad - it sounded real - there are many newspapers that could apply to that ad right now. 

Saul Alinsky – community agitation -oh could I tell stories

houston has zoning ???!

TN does not seem to be my state -

Miami – dialed 911 reported a fake armed robbery – person who did so had a gun and was a felon – how to distract the police – fake armed robbery – suggesting an armed robbery – perhaps real one of someone else – and how a felon could pull it off. 


Careful In What You Buy – Saul Alinksy Yochols are Watching
the “Abyss” - the book that came today – it is based on dungeons and Dragons – but is not a wizards of the coast or TSR product – it's made in Canada according to the back cover 1997 – Dante's Inferno – being a Demon in Dante's Inferno – burning in hell or being thrown in hell if you don't believe – trying to go that route aye – seeing as I am addressing a Canadian it appears – if we remind you what you are risking with your beliefs you will stop – the intro – the intro – on the circles of hell – very obscure and thoght out – at least I called it right this morning – just like in ebay –“boot camp” the starship troopers-  they let that throuhg – they blocked the rules on amazon – the rules got very expensive as was this book – but in ebay – they did not block me receiving it – but it was showing what I couldn't have – stirring the resentment – very clever and subtle and you are still trying to wear me away – and it's getting more subtle than it was – pain in my tooth bottom right – there was something stuck there – I went to it right away which was a mistake – but that tells me mother is aware I am writing this – she or I recieved plenty of sleep attack and one broke through – tiching back left claf with left hand and passed gas and coughed as I started writing this – the sleeps attacks and the one that broke through I was reading call of cthulu from Chaosium which is not wizards of the coast but is established and somehow that seemed  less dark than the abyss – which quoted scripture – gave the verse reference – a first in D & D – but there were no sleep attacks while reading the abyss – and mother just called out that dinner is ready and was trying to get me to answer her as I typed the last 5 lines 17:59 EST  - itching left knee with left index finger as I turn on kfyo.  12/31/08 – it's midnight in Europe.

Also if the enlisted feel things would be run better with them in charge and setting pay rates - um deciding to put Barack Obama in charge  is not the wisest - but it is not only the enlisted involved-  I know that- but this is what you sold them on - union style pay for military - but you didn;t explain that the union way does not guarantee happiness - not that everyone in the military is joyful - shall we say from my experience the military does watch a little on boredom and - ti manages development better than the union ever did and that is a key difference between a military shop and a union one-  But many in the military odn't like that- - there are parts of that I do not like as well and it could be better doen - having worked in what could be a union environment-  couple times-  you may not know what you have until you don't have ti - union promises job security - there is no promise of fulfillment or development - they train you not to want to develop jsut fit a mold - the union system has an inherent flaw and again where it has been applied-  we don;t have the industries where unions have been applied.   scratching left forehead - thumb on right forehead it's the right hand -

the military unionized and on strike during a war – the military does not agree with management ove a key point and US government collapses.

the union is trying to unionize the military – make it like the union – which relfects on them ilitary not squaring things well -  and that unions are not competitive and get destroyed-  they have not done well by american business- so now trust them to defend your kids – you'll kill yourselves

Walter Williams – for Rush Limbaugh

Mrs Williams passed away – 48 yeaars – this is the host – caller :  host ended up talking  - I went to webiste  - I did forget the second book - -  rubbing right side of face with right palm -  Estelle was the caller -   she had the host talk about his wife and her death and cremation. 

I was born in 1974 – 1974  diodge pickup  2008 lincoln – lost of differences in UAW ot military-  and he is saying the military should od things the union way – use union tactics to make things better for them – EXCEPT THE UION IS BANKRUPT AND NOW IS ASKING TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE SOLDIER ISN'T IT – THE UNION DOESN– Tim Raleigh

Pat Oralndo – tcollusion between wall street – and big banks – say more on public radio or talk radio about the collusion -  - he tried to pull a circuitous and slip a point in – with the collusion statemnt -   modus operandi -   - Quercus alba to you too – Latin 101  mufidis mufidus I think it is to you more  - mephitis mephitis

yes everyone wants to rule the world – how true - - I like that song – from Real Genius

grass cutting decrease home value – thank you for  house is a liability and not an asset of mine coming out – if houses were treated as liabilities – uncut grass would matter less and it is not a neighbor's right to force a person to cut the grass and consistentize how houses are made – wrinkle in time -  yes – 60 billion dollars – each – monopolize communicatiosn tool – email he is talking about being monopolized -  it was a threat  - we are currently losing the free society I think - 

humane way of getting rid of rich people – not practical anti-trust-  I would like to try to fix that-  or bring more equity into the system – as some rich people looked like they starved haiti and mexico with ethanol recently as well as the housing crisis -   seller collusion – can we say car insurance -


I have tried to force military to obey the constitution or have proposed it-  - caller got host to say  you can't force government to obey constitution – then there would be less point to having it – you can sue the government though and because you were soft I did not here your first couple words- as I woas tpying – uncosntitutional agencies caller -  suing government because military not obeying constitution is what I proposed as it has been made clear to me I can't sue the military – could i sue the government though to disband the military because it doesn't obey the constitution and is at odds with constitution – and is uncosntitutional in action – I ahven't done it yet.  The marine is not giving reason not ot – by it's actiosn currently. 


work 12 months of the year – no – but only because I fled and they did try to force me into a job-  I reisited – it would have been a yearly job if I had not said no – and was beocming less voluntary – I didn;t have and was not allowed other options by the city – they blocked other jobs – and other avenues of living.  And did so for over a year – I wasn't out of resources so I could resist – but they wre draining them. 

UAW pension promised by a corporate entity not by governent and the corporation cannot pay and the union benefits far more generous than military and you can't pay themn – very different – sophistry good

Military draft being compared to slavery – these are the times that try men's souls – and I think for some things it makes sense – versus a private citizen making you a slave – that there is no justification for that – that is my case. 

Postponing Reality – yes people do that. 

2 pair beating a full house- weith God all things are possible -  slavery and role of government to protect againsyt unlawful use of force 

evil concealed by moeny – does the woman want her lawn mown. 

Slavery forcible use of one person to serve another – what do you know I did learn something today – I was a slave – DAM used me as a slave – as did Pittsburgh  - give to Pittsburgh symphony orchestra  OR ELSE – the worker at the airport who has three people in family with  not cerebal palsey – but some other disease with a C -   - we need to help him  - cistic fibrosis maybe-

former student of host – is and ought to determine relevancy of statements or their opinion or not – I edon;t think that that applies in all cases – read a text and be specific versus trying to find a rule that may or may not work in call cases – normative and positive statements-   we'll be diagramming sentences for past and present participles and dangling modifiers . 

cell phone  Ft Pendleton  - Marines – nice to hear that once in a while – support – you're lawful evil – dDEAL wWITH IT – until you correct thigns yourself.  - yes the FAA – airline strike seems to have left a memory-  - caller mentions Al Capone – Freedom of association -  you don;t have to be union in electrician and I know my electrician was dirty – he was non-union – or are you saying he was union working for my old boss -  peer pressure is never great - - the idea of opposing the work – not the owner the work was bad at the beginning-  there must be a better way to ensure fairness to workers – unions arose in anger and that is part of why they are problematic and that was true at the beginning. 

oil CEO';s were not greedy it was supply and demand of oil contracts whcih were manipulated – oil apparently from the massive shift was fien the whole time – someoen bought up the supply on purpose in the contracts – eye of a needle for a camel  camel – and these days they make needles I bet with nanotechnology and microscopic eyes.

wouldn't a gold coin – like shrink the money supply ? - half of money is trust – banks loan – they don;t back with gold if you made contracts in gold-  shrinks ecnomy – because less than what banks can loan in paper

I thought he said bailout finance industry that they need a bailout not the cars – I have an argument for finance industry and not cars – James was the caller

James - echo what a lot of people said – not sensible about banking bailouts -  demons in the stomach's of my patients – that is what doctors used to think – moral hazards – he is doing the academic thing too – Gold standard – Rush your audience must have spent more time in school – it could teach it.   I am laughing now this is getting so ridiculous -  what if someone proposed an alternate bank structure to citibank bolstering other banks who didn't cheat? - AND WEREN'T PART OF THE SCAM THE BANKS WERE IN ?

shroedingers cat followed by phlogisten theory today I see on Rush limbaugh – Statement of quaker Profession – CT caller -= need strong banking industry-  it ain't strong if it's cheating  -    stirpping of airline – have ot know the airline -


If the act was a problem for anks to uphold or abide by – they could have compalined to the government if there was a problem amking loans to poor people – the fact that they didn't complain and allowed a mess to blow up should suggest hanky panky – the strategy they employed keeping mouth  shut till the blow up hits is the way to get rid of it completely – complaining with legitimate data in hand – congress would not fully repeal the law – they would revise and the banks didn't want that- it makes more sense this is the bank's attempt to get rid of all housing loans to poor regulation. 

congress could and I think should encourage banks to make loans to people they wouldn't make loans to – banks can find the good model – they don't want to – not as much profit – availability to credit grows I bet by a non-linear curve – grows faster than linear to income – rich people gets tons of credit – poor can't get any – that isn't really a good thing. 

the banking industry created the mess of the housing crisis more than congress did.  The banks could have compalined and were negligent in their business models for subprime loans – congress did not set subprime rates – banks did – they chose to have it go bad. 

Nikkei always has less choppiness in it when I look than Euurope or US – DJSTOXX or DOW 13:09 Est 12/3`1/08


Alex Canada – gioing more towards liberty -  once legalized theft begins it pays for everyone to participate – unless you give up something more precious by aprticipating – it depends how you value things – by participating in the theft if you value ideas and honesty – you have to give those up to partiicpate in the theft – thus better eduucation could block even government subsidies – if people understood things. 


Keep People Able to Live Alone if they Choose
76 and not take social security – I of course am in my current situation as a disabled person.- a PONSI scheme involves things that are not in social securuity – it isn't in spirit the same thing.    Social security may have come in 1936 – I would not want to count on my children – don;t have any-  but rather be able to take care of myself – some people do not have a traditional family and that is better becuase the traditional family as happy is a lie – it is not in every case and there is evidence it never was – IT DOES help you control people.  Which is why they want to get rid of social security – that is why we are destroying – make sure it is not around to support weird people – kill them off instead – whcih is why they don;t mind me on it- they plan to kill it off.   Soft caller too – had to turn up radio

Limbaugh – the host got off Orin hatch and about to give testimony and then it was hit with a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error 12:36 EST 12/31/08  - I was also emailing hillary clinton which was spoken by the caller and not the host and that was my mistake – they detected that- because the error came right hitting the submit button and seeing the thank you screen.  - but blocking the hatch comment of the host was more key.  

Chapel hill  - the call before named dropped - - Vicki currently – anti – hillary clinton call – take oil profits and give them to the poor – I supported oil profits to science fund – which clinton proposed -  that amy have been wrong – I was so for it – it just was an idea I think I said substance while Obama  said nothing – I don;t in honesty remember adopting that idea with enthuasm – I woudl just happy to hear a democratic idea -  If I did I was wrong – but at the time it was just nice to hear substance – SOMETHING from a democrat that was not hope and change - - I am not usre it is the oil companies who made excessive profits – compared to others – and i would measure profits now – I would measure excessive by any public good that came out of it -

Dungeons and Dragons and Paranoia the Role Playing - I may still get Extreme Paranoia - it was good just to read about bright vision re-education centers
In the war of the lance ou have to get to DL9 before the metallic dragons come back for all intensive purposes – in the 4th – the draconomicon – only chromatic dragons – oh my god they're clever – terrible books – written more like warcraft than D& D which is what would happen to D&D under an Obama administration – and only chromatic dragons – no good dragons – they are not defined-  the monster manual only has evil creatures – which anyone whose gone earlier knows the monster manual usually has evil and good creatures – there were angels in the current monster manual – but left out so many good creatuers-  solars, planetars, was there a ki-rin – they're gone – the guardian naga – lost it's good alignment – and biggest was tiamat stayed-  bahamut disapppeared – that was huge – the dragon stats – and the metallics with him – only nuetral or evil creatures mostly in Dungeons and Dragons – the good ones were not updated-  they did devils and Demons-  and a few angels – they used to be called devas – but eirenher – not spelling it right- even the foo creatures who are in the upper planes – pegasus – no unicorn – there was no unicorn – how did you do that – there was no unicorn in the base monster manual – oh my god – no way- the unicorn is there -presented as neutral or that is my guess – but both the Kirin and coutal are gone and the coutal has been there since the very beginning C! - the kirin  is in the first monster manual – they know.  - They used their recent books to show they know.    I can;t beleive – I mean I got that – that they made book run of crap with the 4th edition – but that it means this – that they were willing to destroy a whole run of books or make them crap symbollically – a whole of books ?? - every one of them has frightened – not the images – but the changes in game play are awful in general – there are a few good things-  but in general they did destroy the game -and it is for a reason – all the good creatures leaving the Realm -  by the way the demons aren't powerful enough – though I note Orcus the Demon Prince of Undead is the most powerful being in the monster manual in 4th edition – in monster manual II – it's a solar – even in 2nd edition a solar kicks everything's asbestos - - I realize you're sending a message – in some places balors are more powerful than the demon princes – somewhat disruptive to game paly cuase it doesn't make sense – but okay.  - Demons have a very high int rating compared with the the first edition – like compare type I  through VI Demons in 4th edition to their counterparts in 1st – Mariliths – type V – are very – the type IV – generally the smartest – I checked again – the basic demons are about right – though the left out it looks type IV – Nalfanshee – that isn't there – they are the msasterplanning demons – maybe cut out for space – but i doubt it – Orcus is the cover of the monster manual – Orcus got way more powerful relatively to past editions - - he used to be weaker in other places – They are sending a message – clearly with the way they made the recent game.

and yes the socdial studies teacher in 7th grade who I talked about earlier as far as I know and it did come up she is jewish – I didn't want to say it.  While we're on middles schools – jump to 1995 it would be – start of that year – when there was another teacher who caused the most havoc for the principle I worked for and she was on the bus with me – giving me a “free bus pass” - there is no such thing and not when it is found on the ground – she caused me to feel bad – something was wrong with numerous records – because she did need a lot of special treatment-  i had a major forget at that school too – though she was not around when it happened -  2 actually – one right after another – at the end -  my first architecture boss was pushing towards a certain girl from my first architecture class – one who got totally drunk – and i did leave a message for her – to call me – at I think the office she worked at for a while in Pittsburgh – large office – she was the one who got totally drunk in 1st year and came to 1st year totally wasted – the studio – and I got to see her through up in the trash can – and need 2 people to support her home -  and my first boss and also he was a professor at one point in architecture said - “she likes you” - “she never did return the phone call later”  - her sister visited campus although she didn't go and I met her.  That didn't happen with too many people.

there was the open window when they stole the DVD out of the car in 2007- we couldn't get the window up – it marks the car – mohter hit the button so I couldn't roll up the windows – she like AC or has since being down here – do not remember that elsewhere and keeps windows up in car – uses AC in  CT we didn't do that-  and in a Walmart parking lot in Jacksonville it looked pretty common to leave windows down and just not expect a person to break into car – I was duped – if I had put the blanket in – it would have tagged the car – but would have been harder to steel from –  there was no good way to win – they did mark the car with that truck with a cone in it – very easy to see very big truck in Lowe's parking lot – in Cape Carteret – and with the window open easy to break into car and steal the DVD – that DVD had a virus on it – that affected my DVD player – it looked like a DVD i ordered – I tried to order on ebay- but I lost that bid – phlegm coming up and coughed – someone who I don't know sent me that DVD anyway and it had the picture buy contained a virus – I was trying to donate it to the troops marking it inside (get it into other hands – the authorities) didn't know if I could trust cops – trusted the military – but before we got there it was stolen out of the car -mother aided because we made several trips didn't go to store first – giving opportunity – we could have just done grocery shopping – she got water treatment stuff – but we could have gotten that any other day and we went to that nursery – first which is a problem place – nothing we got there could have been earth shaking – plantings for house – she lengthened the trip to give opportunity and hit the wrong button “accidentally” in the car so the window wouldn't close -  and I had to either cover it with a blanket in t-shirt weahter which would look odd-  or leave it open – could not close it-   the people walking in lowes when we were in it – with the game over t-shirts in green on – because they had stolen back the CD and it wouldn't go to someone else.  - a team effort-  which makes accomplices – including – the person sitting next to me.   Though it is hard to prove – though she's never hit that button in a year or ever again – just that time.   A VERY CONVENIENT ACCIDENT. 

discussion s downstairs - - spongebob squarepants on kfyo  – coughing as I remembered that – it didn't stay forgotten – just as sports comes up on kftyo – head pressure ah – but yes I didn;t like the fast food theme in spongebob – I didn't watch it much other than that-  my CCAC spanish III -summer 2004 teacher mentioned spongeBob and she mentioend it prominently like I would say something or – she tested who I was with – the divorced dad comment on telemarketers – and there are telemarkters who are divorced dads and liek the judge orders them to work in telemarketing to pay alimony – she brought that up and I wasn't that – she brought up the tree hugger and I said yes – but I didn't get I would identify myself as a Sierra Club perosn – spongeBob Squarepants was sprung as well she dealt with it a lot in whatever primary or secondary school she normally taught spanish at -  'appreciative'  for those who care – okay you don;t like the whole story – the one victim who remembers to much for the authorities -  THAT'S IT KNOCIK IT OFF WE DON'T WANT EVERY DETAIL IN YOUR CASE – STOP REMEMBERING THE PAST  - YOU REMEMBER TOO MANY DETAILS.

Alright I shouldn;t have voted for Bobby Rush for Mayor  - But Don;t Like the Daley Machine  so there wasn't a good choice-  Daley was the better choice only  by a little - he didn;t say anything that crazy  that I knew of  at the time -  you're trying to remind me  that I  voted for Barack Obama too  at one point in my life -  Um seeing the Chicago machine - is he that much worse-  like we are here because of the Chicago machine with Daley in power - so If I voted for Rush - Bobby Rush - not Rush Limbaugh - he's not in office - like it stll would have broken up the Daley Machine which has done what it has - I am not sure that a black congressperson even if racist would have been worse than what has gripped Chciago - his supporter got me registered to vote - when the moter voter thing failed and I found out on the national election I guess in 1998 that I could not vote in Chicago - found out at pole I wasn't registered - and i did fill out a registration form in Chicago DMV when I moved and it "got lost" - and by heightening the suspicion over the black senate seat is he helping - oh if he's working for Nancy Pelosi I will take the chance. 


if you call a decade like a century  00-09, 2010 begins the second decade -   the twentieth century stopped in 2000 – you are going to 7th grade and her – so you researched that-  she became vice principal before leaving – she isn't positive – she yelled a lot one – there were 2 incidents if not more – neither with her directly – well one was - - in her class there was a question and we were doing the answers publicly – she after each question asked show of hands of who got what on this quiz on like a weekly reader paper – but yes I always remember that too and until last couple years as a positive – but it made me stick out – there was one question where most people did not know how to count 19th century versus the 20th – thinking the 1900s are in the 19th century which is quite logical – but humans aren't that logical – and for some reason – I saw it somewhere – honestly on jeopardy maybe somewhere on TV maybe a cartoon – but I know how to do that correctly and that the 1800s were the  9th  (19th) century and I was the only one in the class to publicly get the question right and a person up my street – which is odd because 7th grade is regional – but the person up my street I think it was who was the first to show me an IBM computer among other things he did a little – we didn't have much contact – but he was the one who said - “how can that be it's not even in the right century? “ - but pushing on me harder yet perhaps he knew my answer was right it was a test of peer pressure – and she did admit that I was the only one with the question right and the rest of the class was wrong – BUT class didn't end on that class -  Franz you big mack truck you get out of my classroom – and there was a reason  -    in science class waiting to enter – several of the students of the previous class pushed my books out of my hands – and waiting for the students to leave in that case seemed to be a bad idea – they had opportunities to attack me – but rushing in quick and getting out of the line of fire as classes changed – seemed to be a better strategy – she was the one to complain -    also the student teacher – with her student teacher – I forgot my notebook – the day the student teacher was checking all student's notebooks to see if they were organized – she tested you on whether you kept 5 papers – and for some reason I forgot to bring my notebook – the student teacher gave me a second chance and I got full credit – but the embarassment of forgetting the notebook the day I needed it was there – and the teacher who was in the room – she was testing the student teacher potentially to see if she was friendly or not – OR – likely as well – they left no mark and did damage the normal way- the student teacher had a burn mark on her face – or a birth mark = distinctive birth mark on face – that disfigured her face but she would not be unattractive save for that – it was communicated that if the teacher was teaching and not the student I would not get credit – I was told to bring my notebook like everyone else and forgot – I would bump into this woman – the teacher in 8th grade – she decided to stop into 8th social studies – one day and I bumped into – she is the one who removed the sign off  - she was in proximity when that sign was removed off my back – oh – the band leader – not the choral leader I had – the band leader – Hartford Whalers – when they existed – she removed the sign – the kick me sign that was taped to my back I was going in the office and she removed it – BUT – later she threw me out of the lunch line – that left a bigger impression – I didn;t know – when they closed the door to the cafeteria line – that was to tell you not to come in – it seems simple – but a student who was just in front of me knocked and they let him in – so I did the same thing – but then the band leader came into the cafeteria room – the cafeteria was in a separate room from the lunch room – fairly standard set up – building is now demolished – but the band leader who had cafeteria duty – came in and threw me out-  something odd happened that I wanted something later for lunch – I usually didn't and didn't have that problem – but something happened that day that I watned something from the cafeteria later.   Adn I was unaware of the rules-  I played the trombone in elementary – I didn't want to play it by 6th grade – I forget why – my interests were changing – something about band I didn't like – had been in it since 4th grade – but I know our black neighbor – our only black neighbor in that class I ahd any interaction with – there were 2 black families -  we bumped into our black neighbor – I remember name – close to mine in the alphabet – last names – we bumped into the husband and maybe the son in East Hartford there was a mall – it probably doesn;t exist anymore either – but there was a mall with stop and shop and Bradley's as anchor stores – but we bumped into him and around 7th grade – mother was going crazy a little while ago – 7:37 EST 12/31/08 – we were in the mall around 7th grade and ran into the husband I think the son was close by – I was in the hobby store there – where I bought dungeons and dragons growing up -  the husband was asking my mother why I wasn't in band – because he was pushing his son to stay in band and I did switch off the trombone in 6th grade – missing the band leader – otherwise I ouwld have had her – but I didn't on my own want to continue trombone and mother duly chastised me for not showing enough effort – not continuing on – but the black husband and the wife I know from more recent events mother told me about is a Democrat – she is on town boards in last couple years – gave mother's groups a hard time about permits for events – coughing as I mention the wife and her being on town boards – zoning commission or something like that in my home town from 4-18 – but as I recollect because he husband was there I wanted to see the son – odd to run into people we knew whiel shopping – east hartford is away from our town – and much of our town would not shop there – we came from easthartford weathersfield – so it made sense for us to go there – but much of the town did not have a hartford connection and wouldn't shop in East Hartford – it's not a ritzy neighborhood or even suburban – city neighborhood and we were suburban now and others who got to the town I lived in in  different ways from other places would not go to East Hartford there are other places to go - - but because I ran into the fahter and the son was around – I saw the son rarely but was not on bad terms – I went out of the store to find him – but I was carrying a book I was looking at in the store and luckily remembered to put it down – because there was an immediate urge to find his son – only getting out of the store – he wasn't there or something and I went back in the store to look at the book and evenutally purchase it.   The trombone incident definitely happened with him – the book incident happened in that store – it may not have happened with him – someone else I met at the mall another time -I didn;t meet many people and for a 300 400 page paperback book – I did read early – it has to be close to that time -  was it him? - the duplex – that was odd – saw him for a while in hockey – and then he disappeared – it oculd have been him on the second incident – he like appeared and disappeared – he was my age and lived in a duplex and had a game console style ocmputer when I had none – so pre 7th grade  - but not like below 4th – I wouldn;t have that excited to see the black man's on – we rarely talked or spoke to each though in the same grade – nothing wrong per se – just didn't talk – where as i was friends with this other person – and that would have made me rush out of the store to see him – BECAUSE – I can;t count on my hand the number of times I ran into people I knew in my hometown when shopping there and we shopped there for years – 6 years  - eventually we switched -

I why should I pay attention to you chad- bobby Rush to you too  - oh am I done with the important part of my story.   I guess I am.  

cough medicines are slightly alcoholic – ah – so that's why I hate alcohol – I rarely even as a kid used cough medicine – definitely not enough to get used to the taste.  So I hated beer later.

There was a move and I think Pittsburgh now has a civillian review board of police officers - I wish I could say it is a good thing -  the review board can be spiked too easily and a good cop who cracks down on the wrong person could be disciplined by it - it is too easy to spike or control a civillian review baord - there is brutality - making it too easy to accuse an officer of brutality will lead to the officer being coerced to coopearting with criminals - it will work like that.  - I can just seem them spiking them board and setting up the officers they don't like and putting them before a panel OR - setting up incidents that can be presented to the civillians in a way they don't get what was done - an independent investigator - someone who understands system gamin or something like that is more appropriate - a civillian review board is just too tempting for criminals  to play with in several ways.

I missed a great deal of 12/30/08 Mark Levin Broadcast – 2 Chicago boys ? Some Jewish comedians just have better timing with their lines – even some of the ones in office and not necessarily in our country – I did see the front page of Al jazeera this morning 12/31/08 6:47 – yes we can yes we can.  It really is a sitcom with a script and everything and we are just reading off the various lines and watching for audience reaction.  The sky is red the CIA told me so.

Ah I Have a Headache so Now I May Understand the Middle East
MAYBE maybe – Israel is soooo good it knows precisely the people it hit OR – in my country disasters have a way of touching some houses and leaving others intact in the same area – and Israel is a long lived country and I do mean to mention the two together – and there are probably two groups of  leaders in Palestine or in Gaza and one group may be people that should be more the leader class because they have a better attitude towards how to lead.  Because of the emotions in the middle east, there may be a few of those people hwo not only are not best Izreal, but long term are not best for Palestine may be in power.  The people will publicly support them and it is very difficult to get the people to see that this faction will never even make a good Palestine let alone be a decent partner  for Israel.   The response has been to keep attacking Israel – if they were soldiers only  that makes sense – but their families are there – they hate more than they care for their families potentially – they cannot really gain any strategic goal by killing a few Israelis – Because of the civillians the Gaza civillians – they should be doing everything to get the Israelis to stop – their actions endanger the whole population and the strategy they are pursuing is one they cannot acheive a victory-  they aren't attacking to win, they are just attacking for their hatred it would appear – which as leaders and the people attacking have leadership in the populace – you have o defend your people you are charged with that – I guess in some cases like the British PM question – if there is a nuclear holocaust  - should our submarines surrender , side the americans or launch a counterstrike?  Only in an extreme circumstnace do you decide not ot defend your people and maybe not even then.  In this case all pretense at being the government has been thrown out or seemingly so and just the hatred remains.   There will be a declaration that Israeli is picking who will reresent HAMAS – not HAMAS the people in Gaza and the better question iwll be did Israel pick them for the right reasons of Israeli interest and not the wrong ones – did it choose a puppet leadership to survive or a leadership that can best lead Gaza.    With all that nice stuff said kids, I have a few concerns the bombing while it doesn't kil anyone – gives no sense of stability, it effects all the people in gaza – the palestinians will not accept the Israelis for all intensive purposes selecting their leadership – even if there may be justification behind that – UN workers dirty – it could be – and a medic could be dirty as well – but the supplies – you can't have a city without supplies- I cannot explain away well killing their supply – unless you plan to reopen  the ground route.  You could address my concerns saying there is no oher way – there was no other way – without doing this the violence would never end the people in Gaza would never get better off they picked their own Barack Obama when they had an election and this is how it ends.   I will have a little faith in Israel that not everyone making a decision is mena-spirited and that “fairly rosy scenario” I outlined above is what is going on -  I do await to see how this will all turn out-  but if Israel has good intelligence – it is possible this is the best scenario for both peoples – if these people dying are the ones who foment the violence and they are the issue – perhaps it all makes sense – why do I get the feeling I will get a headache every time after I figure out the mascinations going in the middle east.   I notice the civillian casualty rate is not climbing so fast after the first day.   With respect the proper poltiical attitude for  even the US is condemnation, Israel is a superior force killing civillians that are not charged with crimes, the medic even if he is dirty like Us cops on the Mexican border can be, he is not charged with a crime – the proper poltical response is to condemn Israel and then oddly do nothing.   Again understanding the middle dos give me a headache – not really – but I do feel like groaning after seeing what goes on in the middle east and you have ot check the face of the card and see if it does rub off to recveal a new card underneath – in honnesty it isn't all that much complicated than politics over here – the toll in life is higher – but it is a ver similar double edged ame.  That is not fully comforting to know that it is like this all the time.  - this still needs to wait for like a four month or longer test to see if it worked. 

Slavery in Africa – well just that there is a historic example where people ignored the fate of their own for financial gain alone – like there are cases where people will do a lot for financial or some promised gain – there are historic where like you could sell out your own tribe.   It has happened at least in one documented case before so it is not unfathomable.

Iguess don't like the few role playing games that use points with die rolls – or all characters are created with and are in essence equal in ability – things I read years ago now have a different meaning.

Jason Lewsi(Lewis) (Louise) in for Rush Limbaugh 12/30/08

but school isn't a business like that like making cars – that is the difference-  we should not protect mediocrity – but the freedom to teach the subject correctly – WHAT if Obama got in and told all teachers – teach this way – teach this subject this way or else – the muck in tenyear system – will block too – getting better people to have tenyear – yes – getting rid of it making them at will - - that is where I cringe – it may backfire and chill ability to teach without teaching to principal's wishes and school's wishes – maybe chilling -  the issues is bad teachers getting tenure-  not necessarily tenure-  they got me and now are angry I figured Mr navy captian former teach turning Repoublican after 3 months teahing – whcih may not be connected to teaching. 

who gets access to tenure and why – because teaching excellence is not rewarded – other things are-  and there – I could question that -

Pre-school sounds too controlling to me-  the problems may be addressable in another way – I guess I went to a private pre-school – didn;t I – for various reasons that was not a good thing – it was used to introduce me to other people – who I never saw again and it was with kids not from my town – went to 6th grade.    Guidance counselor – the one in junior high -was dirty – not sure on mine – the other one who dealt with the other kids – whose son I knew for a few grades -

Frank -   H in Nc – yes good comment – his local catrholic school – for child – I went to a catholic school – they are trying to locate me -

Michelle Reeve – wants to disavow tenyear - - tenyear isn't great – with academics-  it may also allwo for more school control if teachers are at will – tenyear has created some issues – and I did go for it earlier – for saying get rid of tenyear- cna it allow for  chilling academic freedom which does not exist anyway – but if they are so keen on it – building support for it – the issue may be – it protects teachers in the system from persecution – I did not see that until now – maybe tenyear only for certain things-  I don;t think – if we did not have a sueprintendent managing schools-  or cotnrolling hiring and firing of teachersa -  - amybe if tenyeared – the amount you can work can be affected – but not full firing of you easily – some protection so that teacher's and what they teach do not become easy to manipulate – but right now the tenure system seems to be the problem – no – noi it's not really – not fully – the problem is the union and the clandestine infiltration - - tenyear may not be such a big problem – it would be bad if school functioned like corporations as far as getting on the same page – freddom of speech should be fostered – somehow it didn't happen – but thei nfiltration and other things-  seem to do the damage – not really tenyear.  Or tenure – as is it called.  - total transformation ad – 2:47 – spam ad when I wasn't mailing earlier. 

Chris teaching in private school without certification – but I don;t think you can for long – you have to be certified clsoe to the same in private school – I am fairly certain that is true -the caller could have been a student teacher in publci school and not be certified – had high school diploma- did not say if she was in college .  - fairly certian my private school teachers were certified.  They had more than high school diplomas. 

Matt in Clayton Nc – beautiful day in NC – we all make choices – come to the beach in NC – guess where I am -    isn't road use more fairly recorded by mile than by gas use -? -   great guy Pat McCoroy is hwo caller finished it – oh  we are going there – the host mentioned the current governor  -

blondy guy – fiarly long hair – high school – parted in center- sort of flat forehead – like sandy blonde is the term – for a ggirl like highlighted hair but natural – I thought it was a daydream – it's another one- he must have started to do something to me – mother moved in the house as I realized I saw him – nto here – in my mind – another one.  14:20 EST 12/30/08 – sort of like my high school classmate who palyed soccer – but not quite the same. 

coud a US child go to primary school in military school or in foreign school and get into college in US ? - so almsot complete control – not quite – other countries besdies indai – UK probably costs more -

the school psychologist and the coffee shop on the corner – that I was responsible for putting out of business because I didn't think big stores were bad. 

I thought teacher's could strike in every state – yeah it would be great to block them  from striking and stop the common – strioke before first day of school – happened a lot in PA

US marine corps  recruitment is up – why is that i wonder – when do I get my thank you – it's up for all the wrong reasons isn't it.


NASCAR may pray to stop northern viewing – keep it regional. 

14:00 EST
from a sitcom the National Secience foundation funded NOVA with Rush Limbaugh we went puiblic television -  oh just a few singularities

Art – enjoying your fill i n – If the call is concise it is hard for me to get down the  tone oif the call – the nature of the call in few words and in tiem – that is what he was testing – with his seeming simple question – what will Auto -3  do with the unsold cars. 

soon to have schroedinger's cat on the Rush Limbaugh show - NPR (people) couldn't understand this convcersation to save their lives
the masny(money)  supply is bnot as big an issue as scammign and forced spending on services that is corrupt – and like taxation policy and bogus charity and gov't products – Granville – targetr of growth may or may not happen - - car in background - - they're all doing theory and with no application or fact situation to back them up – oh shame on them.   - not Greenburg – you said Granville -

Mark – earth and keynsian – and pies-  - you are so far off the theory -  Friedman was in the other call – which is why he brought it up – what I missed – what I didn't get under pressure - - they are trying to figure out like how to beat me in court – they're beren doing that forever now- over a year – mom with what i forget – now how to confuse me with a question. 

they think they fopund a way to rip me off of hearing the whole call – we'll see it. 
My won fault if i signed a mortgage-  don;t agree in all cases – contracts are not all the same -


I noticed the host mess up the acronym a little whiel ago – they do that-  NRLB

you don;t HAVE to patronize a union – but in some cases if you do not – they use peer presure and more to GET you to do what they want. 

13:31 EST
free markets – WI  - we don't free markets. 100 years – retirement – he was a fast talker – NLRB – NLRA persuasion as a power gets interpreted – no they don't operate within free market – they skirt that because of brand loyalty and buy american games -  just in time mech for 30 years -  - $15 an hour  – excluding benefits and previous retirement – again fast talker not really annunciating – they practice that monotone style – I encountered it at CCAC - - next

Railing for a Bailout in CA

you're not building a transit system across CA while you're in a $10 billion debt  - - certain ideas need to be totally repealed never mind totally recalled. 

Jason I wouldn't agree with you – government might be better to allocate resources if it got lucky – I am sorry but if someone could force people to give up like mowing their lawns-  the upkeep in landscape – if you could shift funding from homes – low wage jobs to high wage jobs – cut funding going ot unecessary low wage jobs and put it in -higher wage jobs that generate service jobs-  that might work – it is a problem with freedom and there would be a reaction to that-  you categoriaclly deny wage allocation would work – that has not been proven – it hasn't worked in cases where it has been tried-  I can;t agree with a categorical denial of it – until you prove the other cases – you have not -  profit and loss currently because it is scammed does not always focus resources best because people game the system and make bad value choices – lawns over science research – BUT if you force it will they make better choices or will it hurt you more in the long run – is the ooportunity cost of forcing it – worth the seen benefits – people won't like being forced and you have to pay a premium to froce them into a pattern of spending you want – and the other side si not calculating that in .   Because fiancial success to them is less improtant than control.  Control first – success second. 


each little failure and frustration – missing this and missing that – if you keep your pride and just don;twalk through it – over time it builds – that is why – each little frustration – eventually one will be enough to tick you off – so when the cheese package doesn't oepn – I can't quite hold my bladder – in the bathroom and it goes off just a little early – not knowing every term in economics – they are hoping one of these days one of those frustrations will turn me into a homicidal maniac – I got born into all of this – I didn't frankenstien's castle.    Ravenloft – deals with how bad people get punished – like that might be part of why they don't want it seen – I have an earlier set – all the lords in Ravenloft are people who while they are made powerful – they also get cursed and the curse usually reflects what they did in life. 

MN not NYC my mistake -

I note she is playing with bread more that she found out i can cook flour -

what I don;t know I can learn – so alright

and a caler who said the last conversation simply – can't spend to wealth have to save for it – they are trying dominance attacks – Brenda-  saying what I miss on the radio or setting a call up for me to miss and having the next caller – seemingly understand it better than I did – in an attempt to make me feel stupid.  - I do see a pattern with what happen ob boortz. 

while the paradigm or service to product part of the economy is changing – that does not mean growing services that government provides make sense  - now i didsn't understand every word in that one – with every economist's name thrown out-  but it is odd to have so many economic terms and names thrown out.  Cash injection - - hosdt said reaganomics. 

sorry if a sub radio host was getting harassed in NYC was it last night you said at he beginning of the show 12:31 EST 12/30/08

creatying cypher on a computer – as they have the fed discussion with jason – communicating on computer with ciphers – which is kind of what is done - - - In this case not only are they not snatching the punchbowl – they are growing it – though it is not a high – uh boom time – but a better thing during the recession we are pouring punch down the drain - - and not drinking it to quench our thirst – with the banking bailout – because they are not helping – or from last I heard – sitting on money. 

paypasl was a day faster today when it wasn't crucial – the payment went through in 1 day after it said it would start processing versus taking 2 days – and the hold up occurred twice – it still tokk several days to initiate processing from the day the transaction was asked for. 

I don't drink beer – so that is an issue – I don;ty drink beer-  I know that's an issue-  that should be my choice. 

I thought it might be instructive to show you what I see – a search d20 at amazon.com – very closely related with dungeons and dragons

I already have bought – d20 Apocalypse – d20 Past – d20 future -  not the future tech – there may be a low seller who is not there – I checked the listing – that can force down a price – if they don;t control one seller they will price match the low seller  - I own d20 cyberscape  - and I did buy the Dark Inheritance a couple says ago – which looks like a bad buy now – given what I said below – but it was the price you see here – with the Future tech – I thought I owned because of the similarity with the title I have – I am not going to buy the Book of erotic fantasy – below – and they would know that if they watched -  liek this list very perfectly messhes with what I own – and it shouldn't – there are relatively reltaed items and prices should not variate or vary so much.   Rubbed behind right knee with right hand -

the darker things are cheaper – book of vile darkness $4.96 – Book of Exalted deed $12.00 and some of what I go on ebay is fairly dark  -and someone is looking at titles and thinking what will a jury think – if it were used in my character – and the pricing – I can't get the things I like with non-dark titles  though then why did Ravenloft get pushed so high? -  They aren't pushing eveything super -high – they are being very selective – trying to put out of my reach only certain things I want to buy.   And it is getting to be more troubling – the book that didn't come is labeled hero-builders – that is part of it's title – if they could ever tie dungeons and dragons to my mania-  they would love that -kill 2 birds with one stone – the NFL would love that too

Intelliegent thinker's movement and you prepint messages like what's his face -forbes does for voters to send to congressman – Herman you're fired for today – just for that -

- that al;so links mom to the callers which was not so swift. 
- the automatic discipline commercial – next – kfyo 11:16 Est 12/30/08
11:15 Est  - you're doing okay Herman
Larry – 15 minutes to get signed up – mentioned time – ho ho – so it sounds liek he has a puzzle-  been emailing congresspoeple – as have I oddly enough -  certain congress won;t accept my emials-  Host name dropped Pelosi – caller wants pelosi out of there – please help us -

fair tax supporter – michael – I got it the retirment and taxes couldn't pay for it Bush – passed gas I picked out what he said while typing – this is the same junk that hey always do – I may stop writing up.

Lucy  waited an hour and half on phone - - she mentioned harry just as I started typing – calling him lieutenant – last room I added to my list for Dungoens and dragons just a few minutes ago was the Lieutenants quarters – kids doinhg things they're not supposed to -  the time time limit was the thing mother took from me. 

I am scared of rapidly growing email movements – Herman – that smells like trouble

I was only 7 lbs when born – something like that. 

there are messages in the Middle east – again as stated earlier – in 3 to 4 months I would like to see the outcome – what were the advantages of the Hez-bul-lah campaign long term?   Who won that – my answer would be no one gaiend what they wanted – Lebanon got damaged – Israel did not get its soldiers(soldier). 

just to satisfy those who care -  a ponsi scheme pays investors of the scheme with the money of the new investors rather than profits - - you did not set up social security to make a profit – it was not an inevstment vehicle per se – that is where the compairson falls apart – social securtiy so far is not supposed to make a profit to pay retirement – investors are also voluntary people – and for the definition htat is important – because  you have guaranteed investors or contributors in social security you can guarantee future money-  - a pension in GM may be more like a ponsi scheme – because the balance is not there GM may not be in business – but social security is a decent idea-  restrict and restrain it to only go to those who need it most – if you consider social security a PONSI in the strictest sense – then the negative associations of PONSI are not appropriate-  BECAUSE they are with a broker who is a beneficiary and tryin to scam money-  in social security the beneficiairies should only get so much – that is a major difference.   And to me that is where the comparison fails. 

I hear limbuahg today about community colleges being overrun – I guess I kind of said that a few months ago now – I hope my own person is prepared for that. 

I like Senator burr's new contact form with the highlighted fied for item that is active – BUT – he did not finish the subject headings – there are subject headings and I can't send him email – always an error – no headings that I saw and quik key-  I didn;t try superhard to get through – but a normal user won't and he want to know that.

Herman Cain (Neal boortz) – 12/30/08

the PONSI scheme anaology to social security – is meant to wedge issue the country apart – it is not equivalent to a PONSI scheme – limited returns in social security should stop the PONSI scheme effect – why won't you have enough workers-  population grows – there is a bust period now where less workers are going in due to baby bust – that will end – there is another boom – to be a PONSI you have to give more money always o people ahead of you – that component is missing – where the person on top benefits from everyone underneath – it si serving to justify the breakup of the US. 

there is nothing subtle any longer about the bias in school and universities 

rubbed right face with right fingers as I send this on email - 10:21 Est 12/30/08

young people don't have same values as old people – that is a sham argument – both generations do not have one value set – it is the big lie that is always told – talk of groups of people with beleif  do not include age -  
when did Neal rate enough that he could take the week off like the big boys do? – he must have sneiority. 

by making someopne a separate country you can kill them versus giving due process?  One might wonder that part. 

I do not see the clear line Mr Netanyahew – that's probably misspelled – sees – one side has much more access to resources – our military will not work on non-lethal technology – it would be perfect for something like gaza I would think – or that would be a situation for it – and that “lapse in spending” has existed in both Us and other coutnries – the Us has less issues with that- - some yes and it should have as well.   But others have ahd that issues more strongly of it would be nice to incapacitate an enemy and later separate hostiels from non-hostiles.  It is unfortunate rockets are fired in response -
i am sure it is source of pride – ultimately what is gained and the Israeli's have a better excuse to continue – Martin Luther King – not everything – but some of it – would be helpful in the era of webcams and cellphones.

Mark Levin – 12/29/08 show – No – I did listen longer to confirm – but I guessed it within first couple minutes – even though he pretended - - he was trying to see-  they will corrupt the host of the show if need be – he did name drop – and – I would jsut like to confirm that the people in congress do realize that if they caught trying to get me to falsely email someone and they helped set that up – that would be grounds to take their seat away – Deception is legal – it wouldn't pass ethical muster to try to fake someone into giving you something they didn't want – the police may do stuff like that under privaleged circumstance – congresspeople trying to neutralize political opponents or – I'm not even an opponent of their technically – neutralize a citizen – and by using false pretense to get information – why do I bet that is against some part of congressional ethics rules – it was Waters and Pelosi – Maxine Waters – congresswoman of CA – Arn and I will have something to talk about.  But there were other things – foxworthy.  Or something similar  No
And by the way – if you get a caller who starts off the following  - I am a disabled active and former military person and merry christmas and how are you doing byh the way – I am a first time caller who isn't very educated and a little nervous  and I am a Christian Orthodox jew who goes to the church of green basalt limestone and it's the first church of my people – and I am former research biolgist  and small business owner and have 3 points to make -  I do not need to hear the rest of that call – whatever it is – there is a 99.9% chance I do not need to hear it.  Which goes to 100% - if the caller has kids in the background, a pet to talk about – or she ripped it out – one more thing which I forgot – mentions your screener in any way, but that wasn't it – mother got it – whatever – or mentions like a specific place – mentions having met the host – I guess in general if the call sounds – like the toilet phone call – no I can't find the thought right now – but that's okay – I'll have another one. 


roosters in cages –probably be  euthanized after starving – oh brother – ho ho – police found them – I am in a cage

principled dictator or mean leader – they're not too far apart – depends if you agree with him. 

we don;t precisely enforce all laws equally – especially with religion – I don;t really feel like suing over prayers – I have – yeah the pledge – if it weren't for the atheist in CA – i wouldn't even know – so he raised it as a wedge issue – no under god shouldn't be there – especially since it wasn't before the 1900s -

Oh Let us Pray
I would bet their is religious discrimination in the DoD from my own experiences – there will not be many complaints because most people will be afraid to complain.  I would worry that any activist group helping lawsuits or compalints against the military would have other agendas.  You're discrimination probably hurts recruitments – your discrimination has also more than likely increased issues with certain foreign populations not of Christian origin – so it does go back to people getting shot – converting people is a problem – there was the incident where the muslim soldier shot his commanding officer because his officer was Christian and he was muslim and he worried  that the officer would shoot up the Iraqis who were muslim – I was I could say I found that fear totally unjustified – seeing what I have seen I cannot say that – I do hope conversions are not going on – and i hope there is sense on the religious issue – I do worry about the ACLU too – they don't help – peer pressure is an issue.  In school in sports it was a big thing no religious prayers – at least in the North as I recollect that is taboo - - it is not enogh to say you don;t have to pray – having been at a non-denominational Christian wedding – it's not – you do feel – it is the same as saying you have to pray to have it in the same room – the room has to be optional – I know what that feels like -  mentioning god is not unspecific – as others don;t use god-  I did just write a theoretical mythology for dungeons and dragons last night because their manual of the planes was so badly screwed up in my opinion – it is odd to be discussing this this morning-  I basically wrote a myth for the creation of the world – it's not hard – it's a myth – but it did – the intent was to gell game elements better than the morons who get paid for it did (they're not necessarily morons – that was unfair) -  if you want o pray as a team adn someone is not religious then they are not part of team – it is not a commonality – it's exclusionary – screw you and your different belief system – yeah I've heard that one before – actually no i haven't – anyone who gets in a religious argument iwth me generally loses or goes away dazed – at least one jehovah's did – the mormons are nicer – generally -  some people though don't say god – they say ahura- Mazda – or Manwe God from the lord of the Rings- and apparently Africa – Tolkien stole his pantheon of Valar form Africa – maybe melkor or morgoth -

was tryinhg to email a letter to someone not on my list – a private company – and 5:03 Est there was a force quit as I was getting ready to mail them – and there was a gremlin iwth me all while I was writing up what I gave them at 5am that I started writing 1 am  -

so everyone at kfyo is getting sick – they have been trying to get me sick for months and one thing that seems to help psychologically is hearing someone else who is sick – they ahve been doing that so I am not surprised.  And now a total transofrmation commercial ho ho – turn your child into a robot – 7:18 12/30/08

The Us in the 1940s would have gained economic power fro mthe war alone - without the holocaust - the US didn't need the holocaust to occur it did not help the US to have that occur - that defeats the point made below or says that the Us while it benefitted from WWII - the holocaust did not benefit it.

bahir yhe's dirty – in NYC too which is strike one – or it increases the chance he is tied to someone else- but he empahsized the word JOBS – of courese I don't have to work now and maybe not ever again – for various reasons – but I don't have a job right now – he gave the point on Israelis killing men , women and children – and they have nowhere to go – no light at the end of the tunnel – and those last statements and the jobs thing coud apply to me -  later he described them as mexicans hoping I wold get into that – and I did – I didn't bite emotionally but I did explain it like last caller – not yet learning they aren't trying to have an honest discussion they just want to be able to distract me – I think I can play that game if needed – it just military tactics and I respect that very little – you don't have the better argument – we'll win by tactics – you under the mistake you have firepower on your side – or more firepower – if God does not like what he sees you won't win – oh the sun just broke through the clouds – Palestinians used to own the land – the Mexicans in most cases in the US did not – that is a big difference when saying Palestinaisn treated like Mexicans – the situations are not really the same-  the Mexican government is struggling to provide employment to its people – that is different from the Israeli-Palestinian situation – you are also trying to bate me into going into speaking on God in a way that will get me in trouble – so it is all tactics and no honest questions – you haven;t learned that won't get you anywhere in the long run – the Host – guy with the red Beret on – I may know hisname last name is leland right – I keep thinking so oddly and type that in first and he must say his last name right but I always get it wrong – at first – odd that – leland with the right first name is a LA painter – and I probably wouldn't like his artwork or think it is wrong headed – though I haven't seen it and don;t know – he is an artist famous and in Los Angeles – that usually says enough right there – though not always – but the host was getting into the Palestinians were used in cosntruction – but not in higher level jobs – art and sciences- what field do I seem blocked out of – oh yes science – care was taken by the group behind my “fun for these many years to ensure I would feel uncomfortable in math and science – in math in particular ensuring a struggle in science – I was set up to fail – and the whole reason for the mental hospital is I was going to redo my math background and shore it up before going on – and they blocked that in spades – no more german phywsicists – at least gentile ones I guess – it is there – you did – they did it – but it was done – and you blocked the miltiary – IT WAS WRONG – AND YOU DID IT AS A GROUP AND IT NEEDED ALMOST FOREIGN SUPPORT AND WHICH GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE COME UP WITH THAT FOR ME AT BIRTH – THE CHINESE DIDN'T KNOW ME THEN – HOW MANY OTHER GERMAN AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED LIKE i DID !!!!  - YOU WANTED REPARATIONS FROM GERMANY AND THIS AND THAT – I'm not dead -  BUT THAT WAS THE PLAN TO KILL ME AND MANY OTHERS – QUIETLY – UNNOTICED HOW YOU SHAPING THE US AGAINST CERTAIN PEOPLE UNFAIRLY -  I want this settled differently – I am aware more of what was tried – and how much more may have been done – how much is the homeland worth – I won't keep going there- I already wrote enough – you might do it – someone might who felt strongly enough – I know I will be called absurd – but it adds up – of everyone  other than – even the US – it got economic power from things – it lost many people – was US bank of america ? - that's not a compliment – Bank of America profitted from the banking scandal – becoming number one – Europe in WWII paid the price – did anyone get something they wanted – yes - - and the ultimate irony – I wrote it down elsewhere to imprison people potentially for asking the quesitons they should have been asking – the foundation for Pat Tillman – Corporal Pat Tillman donates to the NFL sells jersies theat profit the NFL – who may well have ordered his murder for going into the military and turning down the draft – it's a simialr scenario – they are funding his killer with his memorial – it sounds a similar pattern – just like being imprisoned exploring the qeustion that needs to be explored and testing the truth to see if it is the truth – scratching a knee and moving there – my point was going to be Palestinians had skilled work at most – but never college and higher level jobs in Israel – and that would be a problem – oand should be a problem – 2 tiered society – oh  -that is happening in the US right now  - seems to be the aim in the US – I hope in correcting things – lessons from the past will be learned – but maybe not the ones that people tried to teach me that may not have been the correct lessons to learn.                                I could leave the ending there but to finish – the caller wouldn't talk about the double tier – skipped that – and we started talking about Caroline Kennedy – I mgiht mention the odd timing of getting a jewish US military person to call – he shouldn;t know what I am saying – but minor detail  - among many other minor details -  thsi sounds terribly unfair to some and they may play on that as I open that door – bear in mind to me – you had every opportunity to say you hate me and then not deal with me in my country growing up – in Pitt at colelge – in DAM – in archtiecture – several times – in  7th or 8th grade – in elementary – all those times you could have just said you hate me and have been honest – INSTEAD in every case  - you tried to pretend to be my friend – you tried to make me trust you – I had done nothing to any of those people except be born the wrong way – race(wrong) ethnicity – but they all tried to befriend and make me feel everything was fine and then later find a way to subtly shove a dagger in my back – and almsot to a person they did that- every one played that game – where later after feigning friendhsip in some cases for years – in one case for my lifetime – well can;t confimr my parents – MOTHER WAS SENT BY SOMEONE TO MARRY FATHER -  in every case people of a certain religion used betrayal instead of honesty – with me – I ahve to go back through and see if another group is so consistent – I bet the answer will be no – I have to wonder why – and there isn't good explanation that doesn't involve somethign that sounds like it is straight out of Paranoia the role palying game – I guess I am mentally ill – ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho = oh but Christmas has passed – I am sure you will silence me somehow – because that will solve the whole problem – was it the CIA or FBI website who showed me the german carpenter who invested in the stock market and was convicted on cricumstantial evidence of murdering a great pilot in 1930s – and it looks kind of trumped up and he was executed -  HOW MANY HAVE DIED !!!! 



yeah I missed the next caller on cars – I hope it is an honest dialogue and not military tactics-  to throw me offguard in the debate – it is the latter or has been – then do not be surprised by the ultimate response – where “Dad” steps in and that will not Barack Obama – I am willing to bet – missed the next two calls – the guy praising Obama – and the guy on bribes – well either I write it up or we paly that game I pay attention to every call – you are going there aren't you – still in the win mode- BECAUSE IF I WERE IN THE WIN MODE ALONG WITH MY BOSS – you would not be around to have this discussion -  the death star and dragon references from before-

I'm in the military and I'm jewish – we're comparing them to Nazis – most calls don open with job and religion – show me why the maps over history of that region lie – and disprove what I say – I have learned that the monster may not always the punch first -  again as I said last night in the Us we would ask for the guilty party not kill everyone – the do the latter -  overwhelm them – but you don't  -by that logic kill all palestinians – if you feel that is warranted-  exterminate (them) in their homes- you forget – you attack their homes too – you won't admit that- the Israelis are the newcomers – that is never in your mind  - and I have to say – make them part of Egypt or full independent – this it's a territory free but cotnrolled  - that is part of the problem and Israel created that – one may argue the bilbilcal claim – as stated previously I don;t like the biblical claim  religion for property rights – I ahve stated in length why doesn' work – why is it fair to keep their free determination generally recognized around the world – in limbo – they are and are not a nation.   They clearly don; accept Israeli authority as a community and oppose it – there aren't too many areas like that in free societies- not whole areas like a city

HAMAS is psonsored by Iranian – and has popular Palestinian support – this guy is jingoist – or I bet he is – highly biased against Palestinains – there is no honesty in this interview 15:27 Est – your forcing the muslim off their own land – laughing in dark sarcasm at this – and Israle gave the authority to HAMAS  -don't fully blame bush – Israel could have vetoed the Palestinaisn Authority-  why not redraw Israeli border to not include gaza – I doubt the Palestinian authority would object – they wil lbe dangerous – see like that's what I don;t fully get – like Canada is very dangerous to us-  they have nukes I bet if they don't htey hav e many conventional weapons and special forces – the US government should fear Canada and the iminent Canadian attack – they're an evil spider that needs to be crushed and poses a sever danger to US – IF one accept the apparent Israeli – logic-  that unless you take away every weapon – there can't be peace- we seem to not be at Canada's throat and both coutnries are modestly fiancially successful and have decent militaries and yes we are worried somewhere about them and they us – but it works – even with the risk – why can;t the middle east work like that? - instead the idea is you have to bomb the other side into oblivion  - it must be and that is what is “funny” or not so funny to me – and when I hear every person come on and be like – Hamas is Iran – Hamas is smuggling weapons – Hamas is with Al Qaeda – it's a major threat  -and do we “hit them hard or do we hit them really hard “ those are only decisions to make-  Oh really – I wonder if Canada feels that way about us – over like the Salmon in the Northwest or main and Washington state not being part of Canada or many other issues – the looney is now worth a dollar I think so that's no longer an issue . . . . .. I HOPE RIGHT

wii injuries – medical physical injuries from palying a video game – well no I didn't quite see that one and don't fully believe it – or I believe that in our society it can happen – it should not happen – where a video game console causes injuries- why doesn;t the Fda or equivalent who regualtes toys go after that product?  - NO bad – what will happen – regualtions put on alternate 3d reality gaming before industry takes off – and like later the regualtions may not make sense – for something else-  will put dumb regualtions on wii  and it is how wii is made or how it forces users to execute manuevers – not trying to make it gentle on them on purpose.  Trying to causde the injuries by design

50 billion and at home

Frank Sinatra – the best is yet to come today you'll be mine – oh why does not sound so good when I hear it – again on wpht as I get back on in a more permanent format for the afternoon – when I switchusers – unless I paly mroe – I lose access to the main letter I am writing – though I could play – there are ways to compensate without switching back to my mian account – hmmm

I would not want to count on the american public to know that 1 minus 1 =0 - I just wouldn't bet on that one - - the house email system - not off the cuff - certain don't use math - I have dealt with a few of them - who like are in proessions and stuff - a manager who could not add to save her life.

stewardship of the earth – does not include silencing a person's ideas and then killing them or incapacitations – that should be against an evangelical's commtimetn to right ot life-  life includes being able to live it – not just breathing – if you shut down my mind – you care committing a sin by your own ethical code-  14:56 EST 12/29/08 – having computer trouble – EVERY SINGLE radio frequency got shut down – I had to switch users to fix it – restrating browser insuffcieint -  rubbing bottom of nostril with left index knuckle – and it occurred on 3-4 stations I tried before switching users which is a first -

lost sound on wpht – 14:48 EST 12/29/08 -  got a repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error - and I had to correct it's name for the palce where i ahd that saved was corrupted – i must have copied over it wrongly – rubbed left with right thumb and forefinger as I did that- the error cam jsut from switching foucs – not even a paste triggered it – that is significant – that error is not just tied to pasting – so someone is flipping a switch when I do any evernt to tirgger it – and it is more a hacker than stream overload – but the audio is out

rtie your points in with sharon -  Taru- huge losses at poles- minister  Los Angeles – Judaism in African community – only moral conservatives are true conservatives – If I did it Oj Simpson call – how we infiltratedthe Republican party – shotgun effect – maybe a friend - - he is saying how they – ah – MN – it has comes up so often -

14:30 EST
goldwater gave way to rEagan – be willing to lose an election – there would be few presidents that could top John McCain – as Rush said – will there be a country left in 4 years - - stick to hte policies that separate us from the other parties-  I would agree that the planks of a parties platform change over time fora good reaosn – the host seemed to be saying that a tad or be careful of absolutes-  so he did get the point in about it being just for econjomic issues-  i was wondering that – I did miss that-  I wasn't fully doing what I did on other calls to catch it – odd that that sentiment of only economic and not social – did not come up in the rest of the call – he did say stick to our cuases later – it was a set up call – I guessed in honesty – I can honestly say that – from the voice and everything else – it was setup for prejudice – it also confirms part of it – someone with that voice had military friends who helped him write the call. 

Sharon – new to election – we have take it back at the local level -

contractor or roofing salesperson – who saw many conractors go out of business-  we made a lot of money with homes in chicago I guess ti was due to government and Chicago regulations - - because his points again didn't match and he was tellimg me – i wil cost him a lot of money-  but you will  still be alive and able to support family – it is  not lots of money or 7-11 casheir – which is what you are saying – there will be something else after – you don't want me to continue as you fear money loss and overlook the cost- the social stratiation – the resentment in Chicago is very high – that is alol part of your system – and I might mention – legally you are not supposed to be engaging in behavior to lean on me – that may be okay in Chciago – other palces don't approve of that

we ahve to subsidize something – for defense purposes – roads are better than rail for universal use -

we could thread between suburbs and urban and get a lifestyle for everyone – I don;t kmind busses over light rail – light rail does have many issues – it would be nice to be able to use more of rural envrion without a car – and get to city without a car – people won't use mass transit because car companies condition them not to – car ocmpanies watch mass transit use nad create incidents on busses – to prevent it from growing and do other things- subsidize vans for handicapped in my area currently – preventing the demand growing for a transit system here – which is probably less costly with enough people to use it – and elderly seniors in tight developments – that may work better – more people could keep independence because you wouldn't have to be able to drive-  driving as a commute – sucks – in a long trip it can be cool – but really if you could not drive the car and go where you wanted – that is way better. - with more busses there is less road consturction or need for more lanes – yes some people could think like that -

suburban sprawl – DAM had urban sprawl – an odd slip their Jason  - yeah I heard the high blood pressure medication quip – I've been off medicaiton for nearly 26 months or more now.  Seem 2 b okay. 

Rail fees
can't ship goods on light rail lines – ahhhh – so they are a white elephant-  didn't realize that -

the glass stiegle law stopped the depression – or was supposed to prevent it – it stimulates wanting a scam – because you can afford to bankrupt the bank as an investor and to a degree keep your capital?  - this law is an example of what could be put in palce for investors and it will be hard to remove if put in place-  I get that you're saying something I ahve to put it together and I am spinning right now-  hard to make that connection – like a headache – insuring the bank's home loans – so they never lose-  that's crazy – because the insurance has been used to protect people who contribute to the downfall – I have to think that out – the depressionb was faked or gamed – started unions – i ahve to see it and I need time – retirement money palced in banks – banks wanted that – because it has to be secure – before kept out of banks – that gave banks more political power – guaranteed loans – the investment community will make a fortune on that-  they will like that – they want new vehicle and that will be the next argument – and that is what is coming – that is like the glass-stiegall act- and yes on that basis it should be repealed – as it didn't stop crises in markets and the first crisis was fixed – is there a way to insure losses without banks – like a bank network or private places who would refund or just train the publci to have a different policy of saving and not rely on banks - - Banks became the source of capital for business and can conrol businesses – AHHH – with the internet we don't need big banks as funding sources for business or safe hosues for money – and they want Stiegall and insured home loans

government part of GDP – no it probably should be broken out – socialists would disagree – what does government do determines that – is it running companies or regulating them. 

Say's law is not true in all cases – I can attest to that personally in my own business experience

Keines – reminding both Jason and I about the show where I didn't know that-  yes I forgot the theory and almost missed the explanation -   Seys law   - we are not able to work – nature of man to be greedy – I don;t buy that – it is against funadamental interst to be greedy – in hoensty – I think in time man does not have to be greedy it is the fallibility of current society that man is greedy – we do not have an accurate definition of man – and you only want that to be true because it justifies the current system and that there is no way to improve – if we do not improve man to best capacity we risk survival of the species.   Rubbed tip of nose with right thumb tip – the romans killed a lot of people in their colesseum – neither game of football does that as effectively -things have improved over the long haul.

paul gray (glenn beck) 12/29/08

added this pat@patgray.com; instead of this paul@paulgray.com  to the mailing list-  things that make you go HMMMM 12:03 EST 12/29/08

12:05 EST ( not 12:05 this is wrong before 12:03 probably 12:01 or 2 and I read it wrong )
rick – media better than comedy central for humor  – - he said the smoke to kill a polar bear or his smoke may kill a polar bear-  I could be ulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning in this closed environment – that could happen – dupont lost a 50 year patent on freon - no I don't support current patent system – it is ineffeicient  they are trying to catch me as I type and I write – he got one and grunted  as he got it-  in the paving asphalt part -  - they wait until I start typing and try to get things through then - - and boy I have head pressure now -  they try to outdo my short tewrm memory and ability to write down - 

the protection of patents for monetary does not provide best good or service – I have noted in the past that companies do things not in the interest of the consumer in order to protect their financial interest when they have a patent – not letting others improve on a patent or making a unique non-interfaceable system making hardware and software harder to use-  those are recent example – while patents do generate revenue – the fact that they also corrupt the invetning process and lead to inefficiencies in making the ideal invetion and in some cases patents block innovation – that is not a good thing and suggests there can be a better system – as do recent developments – how people work in some places in last couple years – patents are not the ultimate answer and there is sufficient evidence that in time that system should change – you are just wanting to keep money -  I did miss a point on the paving – he said something and he grunted the minute I missed it- he was aiming for that to happen – and they do seem to alter what remarks they say based on whether I am writing and catching everything or typing on the computer and vulnerable to missing things – and we are behind the scenes both palying the game-  I am typing enough to tempt them to say something – and they are trying to say it in a way I won;t get it down – and I have to debate how to respond to that reality. 



Michelle Obama - people stay separate at college people in colleges do seem to do things to keep people apart – that was my experience – it doesn't happen by accident – it is not completely the fault of the honest students- they are herded well in mqany cases – only to some degree are they at fault- many people have agendas on college campuses



I knew a john gray – and kept memory associating – put in jonhgray.com – nearly 


can't hear ksev – it appears

gaza strip not in Israel power-  ah but like Israel control all goods going in and out – doesn;t it -  when you say Israel no logner occupies Gaza – that is not – while that is true it is misleading – Israel can blockade and siege Gaza which it is doing now. 

The quotes were stupid -

smerconish – so the media is researching a few stoires-  cut to the bone ad – when I was getting my inheritance wiped away in the stock market – so a guy is having a little bad luck  was a comment I got to hear on a radio station – right when BAC held the big check for 9 days and then things nose-dived..  -  and right now his ad for elevation and weight – played  and yes I do weigh like 350 lbs right now 11:32  Est 12/29/08 – wanna discuss how it happened-  didn't you wanted to hear that part – and that in part it is to make me harder to kill – can;t starve me as easiyl being fat -

oh  polar ber oh polar bear - why art though there ? - for fundraising is the current answer

Maine caller – Mike I think – good ole mME winter – why are u conservatives so nuts on global warming – next -

Cliff- talking 2 u again – deathe threat to me  methane facts for cows – hourl or something or daily and then yearly – name dropped PETA -  - wihtout animals we would freeze – dude we won;t kill all animals-  and you aren't for animals-  PETA is like the Sierra Club and they aren't real environmentalists – talked about that – your portection of animals likewise is not environemntally accurate or correct – among other isseus -drugging a pet in a hurricane – I won;t forget that one - - opolar bears do not live as lon as our children – my lifespan wil lbe short – next – I was the polar bear in the earlier call – and polar bears produce methane – one coudl say that about me. 

80% say global warming is a problem – how big of one – how big a contribution – and does something take it away – carbon can change form -  H – NASA is based – caller Al Gore is not a scientist – easier to discredit climate scientist than Al Gore-  - but they can both  e discreddited if they are wrong – the jeopardy music and then price is right gong is a nice touch -

Yes I am afraid global warming in US will be used to destroy US
Christmas is over and I certainly do not need a sweater -

match.com uses camut – albere camut – I mentioned that in an email – within the last week – high school  - very odd to have coincidentally hit camut -  Ka-moo – is the pronounciation – wpht

heads shaved clean for autism research – shaving grace commercial – smerconish the morning host mentioned -  wpht – I shaved my head in the mental hospital – it has other connotations – like being ready for battle – that is how the activists in CCAC used it – in Spanish – that oen person -  there were others – they would shave their heads when I won the first couple battles. 

on your point mr smerconish – it makes sense to shrink newspaper staffs – and it is not right to hold people hostage people can all the internet it is a time to make the industry more efficient at delivering the service and cut unneeded jobs – it is not true that all news will die or reporting will die – it will change – maybe improve – can be done more efficiently.

seal sushui for polar bears -

it is the WWF – world wrestling foundation versus World Wildlife Fund -

you're bombing a city of Palestinians – they are defending their home – and yeah Israel kills their people – they can't kill Israels – and it's done like that – Israel takes heavy civillian reparations for nay death of an Israeli – and the Us doesn't acknowledge the Palestinians as people -

the woman saying global warming – before that call on it – on the science of it – she mentioned science in her call and then I got him – could they trade off who gets on with host?  Get the line and pick who says what -

melt since ice age – bounced a lot – got him -  they know I am writing manually and there I can keep up – and I did – he tried to test it – I may need a new shoe pair in time – I don't use them uch and I could online – walmart will sell I bet – so that won't work either - \ he went all over – have to come out  cave – the bears do – they  target the elss edcuated - - the feedback was probably him getting told – I kept up – he didn't throw me – one place I forgot and then remembered through that whole spheel – I can write with a pencil and keep up – mr atmospheric and geothermal research guy who gets the portestors of global warming.   - mentioned football and baseball teams as well . - lijke no real caller taks like that – Russia nad Canada – grizzly bears – they are listening in – oh boy so that call was loaded – I guess will analyze it – but a problem call with several messages

gloabl warming  man 6% of carbon – making global warming  questionable – what figure will we stop global warming – repeating global warming a lot - - monique – you can adopt the polar bear – the call – the language was fnny  like the others

Sarah – WWF not wrestling like I thought – World – the envrionmental group  -  Icaught that – words that need – to b translated – they  do that -   adopt any animal – how do you know what they're doing – after seeing the scary club – the fir tree people – I worry about that-  John Muir

geo – redding PA – day earth stood still – only movie on – for this person – next – no we apparently are going to hear more – fast talker – only imax theater – (science center – Carnegie – Carnegie Science center has the imax in Pittsburgh – and the call was in that style – with a bburied thought  and I did miss it – but we will work on that

dangerous religion – global warming – ummm – lemming jumping over a cliff

wayne - polar bear don;t just picking off the seals – seals have to come up and breath  - it didn't wor with Jesus. - I haven't left my apartment or place in over a year – go out once in several months right now – that is what he is talking about     - I also don;t have a lot of food-  he is talking of starving polar bears -  polar bears a nuisance – in second half I am the polar bear – flipping hte anology.  And he is angry as hell – and now he's threatening the host- know what you're talking about – wpht 10:18 Est 12/29/08 – know what you're talking about – know your facts on my case -

yes our first holocaust denial call on glenn beck  10:13 EST – we ahve those all the time – NOT – and 20 years in prison for holocaust denial – a threat to me how cute -

snow fall in 1941 in houston just like this year – noted.    -we save the polar bears before other people – isn't that interesting -

There isn't any work - it's only a game - and that is how money gets perceived and that i9s the problem with gamblin - it encourages the idea that you can make a living without actually working - which does not work in the society for a whole - if one did a good and service analysis of gambling - not good and service - but the gambling transaction - what do you get for your money-  1 person or a few make out and everyone else loses - Not best relation.

9:54 Est internet came back all on it's little lonesome 12/29/08 – kfyo is silent

It's just one person – I just – should I write this-  it is noted that if one soldier is kidnapped in one case or one person dies in another – that is justification to invade another people or one has done that in the last 3 years I guess – I am only one person of the US being hounded to death by some not fully seen force to this date.  The methods used are very similar to how things have gone with others.  It woudl be nicer to turn this to a better note – the strategy of condemning the other and hatching a revenge plot to get them – perhaps it has been successful with others – I think it does more harm than good and I will try to find a different way- you cannot fully be Gandhi and come out okay in certain circumstances – BUT – if you oppose the acts of others with acts of your own – you have to make sure they are justified thrice over – something like that – it depends on the scenario – but in a more political war – direct action should only be done to blunt an attack – something like that -

8:39 EST 12/29/08 -internet still out – it cannot stay out forever if where I am – it is unusual for it to be out long unless there is a hurricane and you don't have that – only a rainstorm – in Pittsburgh the internet I don't ever went out due to service provider problmes-  it has been a few months – but it does happen periodically here and I bet even that is too frequent. 

Yes the internet connection got shut down at the station level – this has happened before-  some freak accident – at 7:37 Est no one will notice much until 8:30 ish or so -rubbed by corner or edgeof right eye closest to nose with right hand – I could call right now – but that is what they are counting on – perhaps – if I wait they won't necessarily know it affected me- how to put this – someone knows and they did it to me – but was(has) been discovered is that communication along the magic terrorist graspevine is not so perfect – and by me not making noise – they may not know what precisely has happened.   At 8:30 it affects office workers and there will be a few even here and there will be a call by someone else and they will be the known oice and not me.   Boy I am having pressure all over my head and in front of my face – not sinuses – in cheeks – on top of nose – hmmmm  7:41 Est 12/29/08

It is starting to look like the internet connection at the station or however I get it – don't want to discuss that too closely – however I get the internet it is starting to appear that the problem is at the source as that is the only thing I ahven't checked – 7:32 EST 12/29/08

firefox can't find any internet sites – so that I can't use the internet -
Firefox can't find the server at start.fedoraproject.org.
Firefox can't find the server at www.yahoo.com.
Firefox can't find the server at www.cia.gov. - and all 4 buttons on the modem register. 7:28 EST 12/29/08 

kfyo was silenced and I looked at the time and forgot it – it is 7:10 Est right now – or thereabout – they would track which computer I was on so I decided to make that more difficult.  - and they can do this thing where the modem won't go on fully – in order to reestablish internet – I have to shut down the modem a second time – because the first it will not recognize the line ( I don;t want to specify my internet type) – once before the used that to shut off the internet connection suddnely-  the line is not recognized- the modem is fine – but somehow the line won't recognzie and you have to shut off the modem and turn it on to get the line to recognize that it exists – and the quick double turn off must make someone aware of things.  7:19 EST or thereabouts   12/29/08

a small rewrite on what I just sent you - oh and I did accidentally put the meail addresses into mccain.sneate.gov  - as I ahve done in the apst - forgot what was on the clipboard - it does happen a lot and I don't mean to do that.  7:03 Est 11/29/08


Life is indeed Getting Pretty WIld
the Afghan Children  bombing – something is funny about that – one interpretation is that someone plans to get people to submit by killing their children – the afghan government looks like it cannot protect peoples children – oh no – I do see it – the afghan in another interview said they were suffering – the economy was – he was 18 Like the USA perhaps-  people vote or act with their stomachs many times if pressed -had to write the paragraph below – but Afghans can be made to vote with their stomachs – one the afghan government looks ineffective  - 2 the Taliban become bloody killers-  justifying more violence against them – that may not even be current US policy – though I can tell many US soldiers favor that – rubbing the left crease of nose with index finger as I was about to write – this reminds me of shootings in TX – it's like that – similar pattern – it will foment a different kind of violence and desperation with the government to at least ensure citizen safety – has Bin-Laden before attacked children like this? -  If you can foment higher levels of violence-  you can turn Afghanistan into a bloody conflagration with Obama in charge – that will give him political sentiment here to get out of it – be very careful of incidents like that which – may be bin – Laden  OR OTHER ACTIVISTS – my “friends” who torture had help on the other side – this strategy is much like the one that will allow the ACLU to try for gun control in California and TX if it is what I think it is – using terrorism to condition public opinion to do unwarranted actions in the groups interest – Kharzai will look ineffective – and will feel pressure to do drastic moes that are not fully called for – and that will lead to problems -  MY BEST GUESS BASED ON WHAT I SEE IS TO RESIST DOING JUST THAT – UNLESS IT BECOMES TERRIBLY CLEAR THAT THIS IS BIN -LADEN DOING THIS  - AL QAEDA REPS DON'T HAVE A HALOGRAPHIC DECAL ON THEM TO INSURE THEY ARE FROM THE SOURCE UNLIKE MICROSOFT AND i THINK MLB AND NFL PRODUCTS DO -  they put these decals with a hologram – stickers on them to ensure you are buying a company product – the Taliban can't do that very easily – and their could be rogue people in it – who made a different deal.    It is unlikely but even worse – in the US it is gremlins who drive people to kill a bunch and then commit suicide – if one could push the buttons of someone with bombs to get them to alter thier mission - .  . . ..  something like that – resting forehead on right first two index finger joints – scratchging right temple with right index fingers -  passing gas as I write that up

I had to be willing – I cannot feel direct threats every day – I had to be willing to allow I may die to have a cool enough head to outlast or push them back into the bad guy role and not do something stupid – they wanted me to do something stupid – they did threaten to starve me – very hard in the US – I had to go into not having security – into if i die I die – in order not to give them the reaction they needed to go at me as they have – they were trying to push me to give them the reaction needed to justify what they were doing to me-  see he is angry he tried to hurt someone he is a monster – and EVERYTHING would be forgotten – that would be enough where I would become the agressor and they the victim – they didn't get it. 


There was a little more that is enough. - 12/29/08 6:32 - there it is - I forgot - it is unfortunate that rocket attacks are the answer of the Palestinians to the Israelis - as it gives the Israelis justification for what they are doing - it is very hard to accept being killed and the war of attrition - I do know now from first hand experience - they are waiting for my resolve to give out - the onyl thing htat has saaved me - is that it hasn't - they can change the scenario as soon as I do anything to them - other than words and even there - they are trying to use that - but without much esle - they will have a difficult time - I wouldbe skeptical if I were a Palestinian that the sanctions would come off if they didn't bomb - I do not the conditions - the pressure- what have you - in the US press - because you killed 1 Israeli and the the Israeli ambassador can represent you as hurting his people - which is his job - to advocate his side - they may have what they need to portray as the troublemakers - it may not be fair - but you gave them what was needed - and yes like the people playing with me - they count on that-  that they can wear down anyone and get them to anger - I do not know that is the  same group - that almost be like saying Israel is behind the attack on me - which of course might be justification for the US government to attack or declare on Israel - which probably would not resolve (this) any way -( Again I do not know if it is Israel -) I do note it is becoming a similar strategy - we will grind you into the ground - that is the tactic aken with me - it seems the only way to beat that is to allow yourself to be driven into the ground in a near  perfect imitation of Jesus - I am not claiming to be him - but that strategy wins - you may not live - but you may - and they never can justify what they did - and my typing is slow - but they can just keep attacking - not forever - their will may be strong-  but if they curtain gets removed and they get called out on their strategy - opinion will change - that is the flaw in their strategy.   Tehy(They) may destroy you first - and they count on that - you will get angry when you see others around you suffering - you will act out and justify the attack - but what happens if you never act out - and some juournalist comes along and says - why is there a grave here - what did they do to you to justify this - ?  - It is not right to manipulate to win like that – (to plan to harass a person into attacking you and then blaming them )- it is highly destructive - I will oppose from Israel or anyone else ( who uses this tactic) -  it just is destructive to progressing and finding a truer peace - not peace through strength and weakening others (peace throuhg honest understanding of each other and making fair deals) - my typing is slow - though it is in email - it still is slow for that - oh mucus.     Others have the same self interest and if there is evidence they can see that things are wrong – they will respond differently and the sides different – it's like an innoculation that kills off the parent – but saves the child – that is what is needed to see the problem. 
   - ah mother is up and tried to ask me something and is now bannging at my window at 6:57 EST in the morning – and mucus and coughing as I edited this last paragraph.

the dead Afghan school children – I do not know – it is possible the Taliban hits civillian targets when aiming for other targets – in honesty with it being the last day of classes – that is significant – I wish I could overlook this – 10 is young in the US – if they a re 10 now – they will be older soon – it is not prett to think this way – but 10 may be the Afghan equivalent of 16 in the US – one has to be 17 to enter the military – the school – it is not a madrassa – I would guess – not approved – a corrupting influence – I cannot say – if i had to guess – it is uncertain whether a head person approved thatr – and it may have been approved further down or the car oddly did not go for the leaders – but went for the children – one is not certain who made that decision – fomenting hatred by the people you hope to coqnuer is not a great idea – anger at children in a new school – learning a new way- that much prejudice-  I am not sure that is a command decision that was made.  Are there many other attacks like that on the school children? – the other attack was at a security outpost.  If it is the only one – that suggests its rogue -

Trying to see Through Smoke clouds - there is Rarely One Option
I will wait – I do not want to say too much with things ongoing until things get clearer if they do – my first impression is that the US isgiving an account heavily favorable to Israel and key details about the Palestinians are left out – it would have been nice to hear from fox Israel blockaded Gaza which might contribute a tad to them being upset with Israel – we don;t hear that in the US – very little of the other information is comforting – though it is inconclusive – in honesty – knocking in place arms is not apparently the only objective – shutting down resupply is-  that is a military strategy – you also cut off humanitarian supplies-  it is probably true that I am biased – the people I know who were more average americans were saying how great it would be to kill Palestinians after 9-11 in Pittsburgh and jsut today on the call in show at 8 pm Est I believe – on kfyo – the caller said each Israeli tank should shoot five shots into Gaza and do essentially a lot of blatant damage – now the calls to talk radio can be planned and faked – one should realize that-  still someone goes there – Palestianis – Mexicans – what's the difference – one wears a head scarf – i actually don't know – that isn't true in all cases.  - i will wait to see  what happens – more important – I want to see what happens if i am not otherwise involved or shall we say unable to see what happens – but I would like to see the situation in a few months – that would be instructive. 


Someonesaid Israel had to do this - this was the only option - there is rarely one option - but time will tell. 

--
I have decided to read Al-Jazeera – the first thing I see is reports of child casualties and UN staff members – 9 UN staff members were killed in the “careful” strikes on Gaza – it is true that the US will have a higher civillian casualty rate with the Afghans – actually they never hit a human target they wanted to in this fashion – from the report i saw. 

There's been a blockade of Gaza for 18 months-  the US media forgot the part i should have known – i knew of a blockade a while back – but there is no news here it is ongoing – the islamic Unviersity was bombed – is that a madrassa? - or is it a University

apparently the supply tunnels – so Israel controls above ground the egypt gaza border or so I would assume – but it is not where the bombs are coming from only that is beign attacked – it is also the tunnels – that supply everything – including the weapons true – but the other side is saying medicine and food and fuel  - so by bombing the tunnels you may starve the civillian population -


while things are better stated and no it is not good thqat 500,000 are under a terror alert – one might note that they are settled that close and that that is a problem yes 12 miles away – when you have a hostile neighbor do you build right up against them? - - and I have to wonder if the bombing is the cause of the problem or a symptom – no it is not really the best solution that someone could have come up with – you have presented your side of the story in a much more diplomatic tone – and in a more defensible case – I might still wonder if the people in Gaza would add a few things – I ahve lived through I know what it is like – when someone desires to turn you into the villain – and they know how to play that game – and what is done – on  the surface looks fine – you want food – i will get food – it won;t be precisely what you want – it might be short a few nutrients – blisters will come up on your tongue on a regular basis – you will have muscle spasms – occassional diarrhea – phlegm constantly be coughed up – and every meal something will generally go wrong – and you will know that I am after you and you will try to convience others – but I have done nothing that the public will recognize as an attack  -it all perfectly fine and no one ever will check the details – and you will know that I am hurting you – but you will not be able to stop it- not be able to strike out at me with major rammificiations to you and I can deny I am doing anything and am setting up coutner-istuations to make you look guilty and I will lie like hell if you ever try to convince anyone I am at fault – I ahve seen that game played and I have seen enough to know – you ask why the agressor is agressing (which isn't technically a word) – making an aggressive more before you blame the aggressor – in this Gaza – that is all heresay – I do not have to live with rockets – but I will say this – Israel has chosen how to handle this as you did Lebanon – let us see if it works – let's just say I will not be placing chips down on it being a long term solution.   I have yet to go to Al-jazeera.    Would the US tolerate being bombed – no probably not – is there ever an attempt not to target – but to just bring out the person responsible-  that may be naive – that is how it is done in other places – things are different in Israel – the question becomes why and I am sorry but saying your children are not secure is not enough for my cynical and skeptical ear – it remind'sa me in honesty of Anne Frank – I am no longer a big fan of that as the story to me seems carefully clipped not to show one thing – but to show one piece perhaps – I don;t know that for sure-  but it is there  - we weren't told in 8th grade what germany was like in the preceding to the war – we were only told of Anne Frank and not context – do you know what it would mean to have pets in Germany during that time – to have the money - - we weren't told nay of that – just here is this girl who died and how horrible is that – there is no spokesperson I get to hear on normal US news for the other side – that odes bother me – I do see that I am considered a monster for something that happened 25 years before I was born if not more than that-  you call them monsters too.  Perhaps they are – I would like to believe that things are done equitably – I wish that is what I intuitively felt- If the Israelis feel the most threatened why are they not leaving their homes? - Because the Palestinians are leaving Gaza. 

I do have a great deal – things are not settled between me and certain parties-  it does bother me a great deal that I was considered a monster in my own country for perception – I am trying not to say fully what I am thinking and yet let it slowly – and to also find out in my older years that it is not how I had been taught in school – that much of that is selective and paints in a very negative light – which is not necessarily the whole story and the jews were always forgiving and kind and the everything else – and not everyone has done it – there is a little that may come out in the future – it has little to do with Palestine and Israel currently – I will try to let it out slowly and not in a cascade.   Because the people who may hear it may not be responsible-  i hate to say it though – the last people not of my government who I came in contact to in 2004 – underneath they were undermining me or so it now appears – like there is little I can you – it is an issue for another time.  I just hope you mistake me for a venemous spider which has been the past analogy to me.. 

yes the badge could have been an issue – a way to link – ther are times – like if I said – if It were me and I ahd something like I would not float pictures of it around – anyone who ahs a picture of the itme – I bet can key in it – rubbed right eye with left wrist – there are a nubmer of object I should get rid of – the ones in my window – some of them from childhood- I thinkI inadvertantly discovered one way to change things – DAM's card in 2005 and the scream – after I did something in my room to the card – the scream waas from another building – pressure in my head now – I didn't want to say that – he doesn't seem to have done anything else wrong – maybe he didn't know – evdience o nthat point seemed inconclusive – I was hoping - - for various reasons I got the idea you trusted him and there was nothing else- rubbed behind top of right ear back and forth – with right fingers

Ben Ferguson -

Obama not super-friendly to Israel – PER-LEASe-  Israel can step up palestinian pressure because Bush is not there – and I could get into how a conflagration to certain jews is the objective – gives Israel a reason to kill off the muslims – provoke the conflict – that is one strategy you see there and stabilizing the middle east like Bush and cheney did – blocks this strategy – brings peace to middle east – some don't want peace in middle east – they want to kill off all the neighbors they don't like – that is my guess at any rate. 

Obama is a lot smarter than people give him credit for being – he will support Israel attacking Iran – smart or treacherous and there is a difference

Israel has to defend – is that what we would do with one person killed? - we would we bomb many targets

I missed biblical proportiosn  

Jeff – caller put his phone down  before -  1st time caller- Israel – has a right to defend itseldf a- mixed up with Iran or according to host – he had him repeat  - Iran want them off the face of the earth – Iran said push them into the sea – did they ? - they said they don;t approve of Israel – it gets colored here – to more than was said – Russia is an ally – well are we still fighting the cold war – nevermind – don't answer that – you're still Hitler – ah Spielburg and the Russians as the new enemy in his movies  - that now makes sense -   Israel attacks Iran  makes WWIII -  - Iran does not approve of what Israel did to the Palestinians – they have not gone much farther than that-  I am not sure they ever said all jews must die – they do not approve of the Israeli state – which makes sense – the state destroyed Palestine which questionable legailty
they have right to defend themselves like we do

1st time caller – Israel – most citizens serve in military – Us family don't know your own home – love of country versus country that is complacent which is Us – Israel loves country -
Arafat smart terrorist – long history of conflict Palesitn and Israleis -   love may not be the only thing in Israel – hatred is a force that can bind a society too – it bound germany for a while I think -
caller – the jewish and muslim – thousands of years   -      dome of the rock – gonna change in tiem dome of rcok  -     policies -   the dome of the rock has to be destroyed for Christianity – for some right wing Christians who may want jews to win so they will build their temple so the Christians  can see it destroyed which I forget what that signifies – but like the end of the world and righteous go to heaven – not in Catholicism - - but that caller was goign there – there has not always been conflict in Israel – or what is now Israel – I think the history is that – a certain state did not exist for nearly several thousandyears – um Europe may have as much conflcit in it as the middle has had over 2000 years.

time increasing as we go down

Dean – Iran for 4 years – 25 countries border continent – Iran not the enemy of Israel – government bought by bankers – Russia biggest oil producer – they drill than we do - -  I love lucifer salute – of Bush -   Ben frugeson – don;t conspiracy – theorist - Utah – prison – Jeronimo – robbed geronimoes grave -  74 years old – born 1974

Israel – tank position in gaza – rip out 5 shots – from each tank – constant bombardment will get HAMAS into line – where has Israel abused their power – um Ben – their existance doesn;t current border thing violate several UN charters – among other incidents in Lebanon – and the settlement thing – why do you need to like nicely divide a solid boundary of Palestine into – peices-  the bulldozing of houses – the water thing – what i know of it – it is hard to see from where I am who is more guilty – saying that nothing is questionable on Israel's – you shoudl know better ben -  if Israel ever mowed Gaza down like the caller suggested – Israel will have open warfare from it's neighbors or close to – Barack – may be helping – Obama has to deal with this mess before coming to office-  and he may be helping us – may  . . . . . be – the timing is right – the mess is a mess – and I am concerned-  I do see the timing of it – perfect to see Obama and judge him

Ben do you want me to listen – you had a peaceful right wind talk radio show – but they did what they did with the others -

Stalin as 3rd greatest historical figure – well he is there – for a while – I get it that he did a lot – of thigns – and I didn't read it all – but – he didn't kill the right people – that's harsh but it is true – if he did – we would hear about him more in the US -  where is peter the great?   - Jack kennedy is close to number one as is FDR – Franklin Deleanor roosevelt.

rousing carousing – elation occassion – I was tryingto think up a better peice of poetry than merry christmas last year at this time – honest occassion – honest good time – how about grace full good time – 4 words but same amount of syllables – I did this last year too – tried to come up with a substitute for merry christmas- it doesn't have quite the punch – but grace full good time is vERY close – I 'll close off on that -

It may be that a certain talk radio host was not used to the – yes the audience will know your life history suddnely and threaten you where you live and say things that apply to you and threaten you – they've been doing that now since 2005 to me- it has gotten worse with radio since 2008 – but this is not a new thing – no it should not happen – and certain people are ignoring parts of the constitution – this is what we have right now – and they will soon run the coutnry . .  . . . or os it seems – you're a pastor have a little faith and I usually scream and rant for half an hour at an extra strnegth hamster volume when really despondant – i found it works better than teething on my plastic dish – Allen I can't make it easier – if it's not stopped now – it'll get worse -  or . . . you cold know what you're doing and have done that intentionally- now kiddies this is the puritan wind in the 1500s or 1600s that made England the Supreme Naval power – see – and this si the silt that built up in Ropme and may have helped cost it its empire – and this is the bubonci plague that hit europe around about the time the priests said they'd forgive you your sins if you paid them moeny- which really doesn;t work by the way-  we may need to resort to doctor zuess liek nursery rhimes to explain why the world does not revolve around the NFL – and aorund athletic competitions – we amy need puppets and they may need to hear the polar bears talking to them before it is over-  BUT SOMEHOW THEY MAY GET IT ONE OF THESE DAYS  - you could have a preaching polar bear on the show – ministering to the animals about religion because after watching bolt and other movies – people might think the animals learn about God too -  try to smile and have a grace full good time during the rest of the holiday season.   It almost works – works for me.

the surrender document while notable is more of a formality – circa history – it reminds of something PBS wold show- it is part of history-  like certain trends and how they influenced things and stuff like that are the parts of history that would interest me more or what happened during a battle – the document is like a photocopy of reality – not always – like the declaration of independence is different – it's making was the important thing – but you know there is a surrender before there is a surrender which puts it in the other category – it is still part of history- but I would be less itnerested in that part of it – it's formal and less significant to the events – unless something happened during the signing – something like that- Surrender of Japan – are you saying something else-  like not sure Japan surrendered – ifthey did it may only be on that piece of paper.

and yes we a week back we did threaten or the other person in the house threatened shortness of breath for the rest of my life – because I am not using my lungs and don't get outside very much – I would find it “odd” to truly loose lung capacity due to inactivity – and it does sound like BS – my father lost lung capacity – but he smoked- they probably can induce that too – there is no excuse for it in my case – but hey that may not stop them. 

the birth issue – um Arnold Swartzenegger was not able to consider a presidential bid because he does not meet the native born citizen requirement as spelled out in the Constitution – um – if someone else doesn't meet that requirement – it isn't a great way to nullify the election – but it isn't cool that the governor of HI can seal a brith certificate and sort of “fudge” that one – if there is nothing then that record should be unsealed and be allowed public access – this isn't dog catcher- if the ammendment is wrong – or if the Constitution then change it for everybody – but it is intolegable to have 2 different legal standards where the guy that looks more like me can be disqualified by something and the guy that doesn't – doesn't have to answer the same question – and that is not something – I don;t want to use that to overturn the election – a person who is president should not be “Fudging” that – it is not really right that they get to hide the truth about whether they meet the requirement when others use the same requirement to bar other qualified candidates from running for high political office – perhaps the whomever of Austria should seal Schwartzeneggers records too and then he could run against Obama in 2012 – like how many - “passes” are there on things – Hillary Clinton should not be coming out of the Senate -  there are some other things that I am curious to know – that are nto yet discussed – again if he has his finger in me – that alone would disqualify him from office – even touching my whole case somewhere – is probably grounds for impeachment – it's not about sex with me – as far as I know – he did or they did to destroy someone who can present political points well and for political reasons – that would be an ethical taint on high offices to be involved in that – and THEY MAY ALL HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED.  Or a lot of them – I am no longer sure – 20 -3 0 – I wish were a joke several congresspeople and senators – some of them have fignerprints – not their own of course – but telefinger prints shall we say. 

how can one not act on a granted pardon? – are you setting up a situation where a man not suppsoed to be in prision is kept in prison? – you get into that – if someone doesn't act-  like the act of granting the pardon frees the man – doesn't it – telling the office not use a made pardon -  the president has to have the right to refute the pardon I would think – like have that as a granted right (to be able to revoke a pardon) – if you re-imprison is that double jeopardy (you technically are prosecuting again for the same crime)  – I haven't – it's not a question I was that concerned on  - the president did that – would it not have been more equitable to  - pre-approve a pardon  - THEN check on donations and only disallow - not allow pardons based on donations – check the donations but only use that as a method for disallowal.  Apparently that's not a word.  Disallowing a pardon  -If the act of pardoning a man declares him innocent – what does the act of pardoning signify? - I would think the absoval of guilt – it sounded like it makes a person innocent – the paperwork office does not have that authority otherwise they could grant a pardon without the president could they not – what is that relationship -  I am sorry but unless my interpretation is wildly off – YOU SIGNED IT  - I agree you should be able to finalize in a better made legal system – we don't have that . . .. . .yet – so if you don't uphold what you signed – all the other – double jeopardy – keeping an innocent man behind bars – etc – all of that comes into play – unless the person gets tried for a new offense – not that governmental agencies ever invent offenses to use to put people behind bars with – but that would be it – someone will fish this one out when you're like 80 and do some nasty expose on you abusing power and they may be right -  let him go and if he does anything else after – nail his but to wall -   Barack Obama will get to issue pardons – ARRRRRGGGGHHHHH - do they sell for more than a Senate seat ?? -

– it is foggy ciurrently or partly cloudy or mostly cloudy – not sunny – there was fog this morning – still is some – and very little blue sky  9:34

FOX The links on greta's page are dead again – can't call up video – trying O'Reilly 9:17 EST  12/28/08- but the links for on the record with Greta – Vansustern – I think it is – none of them are owrking – except the email link – but that doesn't get one to the separate video section – this happened once before 9:31 Est 

by the way what value is freedom of expression if you cannot use it – which a reporter on FOX was implying the Iraqi should not have useed his freedom of speech – that that meant he didn't value it – not sure I see how throwing shoes at the president-  which are not bullets – how that means he doesn't value the right to use the freedom – I hope if the reporter just heckled the President or did some of the things code pink did at the political convenetion for the Republican party – that the reporter or anchor would support the freedom of speech where it was used there - - perhaps not everything code pink has doen – the handcuffing I beleive to thinks and – some times code pink has gone beyond freedom of speech – but if the journalist heckled the president like he gets here – I hope that would be at most a couple days in jail for interrupting the meetings and that was it and I hope the reporter wouldn't act like that was so far out of line – I guess if the Iraqi was at the University of Florida and threw his shoes at John Kerry – he might get tasered – or in that place in the Us he might have to worry about what happened to him  - but in general a certain amount of civil disobedience not like instigated by a secret network spying on a person – but individual civil disobedience is tolerable and tolerated in a free society.   The reporter knows that – right?

um on what language to adapt more can be said in english with less characters than in spanish – and hebrew is more efficient than english from what I have seen – and still uses characters it appears – has an alphabet – I am not more familiar with that- my one attempt so far last year to get a hebrew english went poorly- on amazon – I got what I ordered – but it was a dictionary easier for a hebrew speaker and reader to use – than for an english speaker and reader – the english words were given in hebrew characters – which I then had to take the hebrew characters and in the hebrew section find the english equivalent in english characters or roman characters so that I could pronounce and I don;t know hebrew – making it hard for me to use that dictionary – and it was odd that – I jsut happened to pick one to buy that was cheaper of what was presented to me – that didn't work for someone who knows enlgish first. 

2 things – how much text is required toi write down a thought or statement AND how many characters in the language – how hard is it to put on a typewriter or keyboard? 

with a children's book with 2 fathers or two mothers – I am okaqy with trying the cioncept – I would have to see the book and how it's written before being okay with it - especially the devil is in the details

So they took the Rocky Horror Picture Off of YoutTube – they used to have the full movie on there – but after I ofund it – it disappeared – forget when I first saw that – but ti reminds me of what happened to the last unicorn.


Discussion of mucus – you can skip this – not a world polciy thing -
Last week and before – when i was coughing up phlegm it was generally more watery and I sometiems would feel a burning in my throat or not eactly throat but below head and that woud sometimes be the trigger later – the phlem would just come up – not it tends to be thicker and originate from the roof of the mouth – feel stickier in my head – can feel it stickiing to the ceiling of my mouth – which is not comforting – but it's there and I don;t how to stop – just coughed up some and touch ed elft and right side of face with index fingers and have no idea why and my right lower side is or was itching until I wrote this – it is hard to ever fully coughit up – even at my bes I cannot get it all to come out and some seems to sit near my voice box – the mucus is coming from a different generator now – the old generator seems out of commission – it wasn't until the gummy bears that mother gave me – that this new source of expecterations came online.   The little gifts and keepsakes – those are ways for a telepath to latch onto you – mother did a lot of that

Medical Education Versus Others for Developing Nations
It came back – 7:53 Est – I wanted to write in – this isn;t fully it – but I wanted to write and did not that I worry about medical care and education for medicine alone in the third world as fomenting unrest because you increase the number of living without work - - it is better to do the economy and other improvements simulatneously – or address the economy and everything can follow – though there are ways to ensure it doesn't work – I worry about certain economic models – I was trying to say in part that in the US there is a need for educated personnel that is unfulflled by natives and right now too many educated people is not our problem – too few is and that is being intentionally done by forces in US society who feel they benefit from having an uneducated mass it appears.  - tip of nose itching and itched it with my left hand – and yes the issue in US is little education is being paired with being conservative-  rejectiing education is being pairted with being conservative which is intentional as what we need most are educated conservatives who could use education to pus forward ideas different from the left's ideals – I am not in one persuasion – but many of the ideas in the Democratic party right now scare me on economics and the environment – and one way to prevent conservatives from undermining those ideas is to prevent conservatives from getting educated and jeff Foxworthy and country music singers – many of whom claim to be backwoods and help create apsersion or use their fame to that effect – we jes want things they way they are – you have to be uneducated to use an all terrain vehicle – education makes you into a leftist is clearly their message – and this is highly destructive and very inaccurate is not – is it Dr Gingrich – you were a professor – wasn't what's his name- hastert taught as well – it is Dr Army – the former majority leader – but the left is trying to condition people on the right not to educate themselves and in certain some types of education would expose  WILD INACCURACIES in the position of some democratic platforms – energy, the environment, and economics are three notable examples.  The left used in the last election that the military were uneducated and were unable to comprehend “the real situation” - several youtube videos on global warming and ofr the Iraq war are notable for playing on that – and the left likes that line that the right is stupid and uneducated and is trying to make that be true – which of course hurts the country 

7:33 EST kfyo is silent and a restart of firefox did not correct meaning – it can still be a hacker error – it is likely to be the mroe substantial kind of error I cannot fix.

A Little More on Dynastic Poloitical Revenge and on Changes to Higher Education
I said with Senator Wellsonte(Wellstone) in MN that that was diffused – that is not fully true- that dynasty – the Al Frankin campaign could well be a direct response to that – though that is an allegation and not proven – it is the right type of person to be a direct response to Wellstone having been lost – and it may well – I have to check my MN politics – Norm Coleman is the person I think who replaced Senator Wellstone – Senator Coleman – with Al Franken – I am still in denial that he will be the Senator IF he is – like the election a tragic tragic farce – we had votes being found in cars – and of course many court contestations of ballots – and one could argue and I believe others may that Al Franken sued his way into the US Senate if he gets in – and who actually won has gone back and forth – graphic color choice menu somehow appared on the has in the last line – wanted to wait to write it up – but it has gone back and forth who had more votes – at this point – that election may not be of the highest caliber of a democracy – put more blutnly  IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION WHETHER ONE HAS WON THE SENATOR OR ONE HAS STOLEN THE SENATE SEAT AT THIS POINT  - but yes the campaign and the tone may well be influenced by what happened with Senator Wellstone – so the point is when you have a death of a poltical figure and that changes the political outcome – at least in the US that does not fully og away for decades – and in my case – someone may have been referencing events in 1972 that occurred before I was born and doing somthing to me which cost Democrats an election before I was born and this is their way of revenge.    See now he can't run – ever because if you run him – he'll never win an election.  We can pull the ole “mental health issue on him” - again I will be interested to see how my case plays out at this point is all I can say.  And the when wlaking in quicksand the more you struggle the worse it is likely to affect you. 

It may happen that US students may get their degrees in India because it is cheaper to do that than to go to the US and the teacher's union may not be quite as strong – we will see.   Itching behind right ear with right hand – but the cost for Us University is mounting. 

There is something else I wanted to add from above and i have forgotten it – somethign that I linked with the political thought above – but was not necessarily a political thought  rubbing right ear with right middle finger right ear lobe – mother came up at 6:46 EST 12/28/08 – telling me she is going to church and trying to solicit approval – she used not be out of bed before 7am.  Rubbing left temple and side of head with left fingers. 

I wasn't going to write this up – but there is that series in the US for different subjects – the Standard Deviants – which  right now Chemistry class $17.99 – for the DVD – on chem I – the standard is kind of like using the electric company to teach college courses – in the US – no professor will likely make a DVD that could replace a school – there should be – there is a market for that – but the professor's union and there is something like that and the NEA will behidn the scenes block and instructional videos that could replace professors and the standard deviants sort of does a High school/college level between class – very cheesy and very commercial – not as academic – By that being there it will block and co-opt a market where perhaps the intent is to be a much fuller substitute for higher level learning at a university at the very least to provide what can be provided versus the standard deviants is a cop out – and potentially meant to be so – to protect the jobs of college professors – I gave a 3 out of 5 – on netflix – change that to a 2 and if it is meant to block better videos from coming in a 1 – it is again not really trying to help educate students – it is being used to force them to keep going to university and paying $10,000 - $50,000 in price for a year of school  and not let them find an alternate way becuase the teacher's union is very powerful – it is also highly corrupt and being very parasitic with the students – I didn;t hope that I could get a full college course – but I now see outside of the Us others may allow lecture like series online – and that the NEA and other educational powers in the US are blocking children from getting a less expensive education on purpose.  From what i have read it was the desire of  the US government or whatever to get college grads to be 50% of the US population – yet it has remained at 25% - the fear is that if you mint more graduates and encourage education alone – there are not enough jobs for the educated – yet one way to get more educated jobs is to have more educated people lying about who want more educated jobs – but yes in the short run there would be more competition for the educatied jobs – reducing the pricing or salary of those jobs – and that is what the professors may have sought to prevent – HOWEVER it ay well be holding back societal development to keep much of the populace uneducated – I do know it was a US goal – it was in my college books that the US was shooting for a much higher degree of college graduates by like 2000 and that has not happened and it is clear various social forces have been suppressing the US in having more education opportunity – and there are some blantant examples of anti-capitalist practices – including the ivy leagues and competitors not letting it slip out that for the money private universities are not worth the cost and it really isn't worth being in debt up to your eyeballs to go to a name private school – if you have excess money – then go – but if you don't – a community college of public school in a cheaper state would make a lot more sense – the education isn't that much better on a course for course basis – it is only with graduate school opportnities and other things does a private school deliver some value that a public school does not – but not really in an undergraduate classroom-itching right back beneath shoulder with left hand -  and preventing mass education tools- high pricing of college textbooks in US – approaching or exceeding $200 – for a single text book and again a dungeons and dragons book with far more illustrations retails $23 it is up to 300 pages -  Us students may want to think about going to foreign University or taking and getting college credit in foreign countries if the US system will not stop using anti-capitalist practices to inhibit the education of students.  -  someone wants to keep a 2-tier society and wants to prevent an understanding from occurring that in many cases little separates those who are wealthy from those who are not except education and where they were raised and someone or many are afraid that if the working class find out that in many cases there is no real great reason for someone to make $90,000 - $200,000 or whatever – then they will lose their salary and they are fighting that – many actors get that what makes them worth 100 million is very insubstantial – the forces in the US are trying to inhibit competition - “you're not an expert on Christianity Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, so yo ucan't comment” - the trith expertise should be knowing the facts stating a conclusion and backing it up – your credentials should matter less than your argument as credentials in and of themsleves – having credentials in and of itself does not add to the GDP – credentials don't produce anyhting people do – and some do want to see that – credentials to a large degree are illusions – it was meant to ensure the system worked – but in the US it has morhped into a way to artificially inflate the price of doing certain service and physical activities – designing a building, making a contract- selling a home – getting a product – all of these are affected right now by credentials – professional licenses and the way those professionals are choosing to use not to ensure public good but to generate money for themselves in excess of a market rate and impoverish society.  The point of doctor's MD was to ensure you didn't kill patients unnecessarily, not to ensure that doctors on average make more than CEO's – and you do kill patients unecessarily or harm them in order to help others make a profit now on top of it – if being a doctor is very stressful  -I bet that could be changed if physicians accepted the decrease in pay and perhaps the responsibility were divided differently..  There is no reason we should need doctors to work 80 hour weeks – there are so many who have some training shut out by the current system and I know from architecture – the architecture license is in some cases meant to – in many cases meant to inhibit competent contractors and others from taking over and handling the burden of work – architects prefer a bottleneck of work and to keep clients waiting forever as it ensure they are busy.  Resting forehead on side of right closed fist – index finger and thumb.    The concept of gettign the best service for the market is not really there in either of he professional models I have seen – the professionals make more by being inefficient and have less competition by not giving out licesnes to draw up buildings freely – it is not about public safety – it's more about money-  with medicine it appears to be the same.  Much more so as there is much more money at stake.   -rubbed end of nostril – with index finger and thumb of left hand.  

Well I still didn't make my original point – but this one will work.

morning silverfish – right above 6:01 EST 12/28/08

It is interesting to not that Indian Pakistani response will completely prevent at elast on a temporary basis – any attempt in the future by the US of asking Pakistan to take a very strong stance against Al-Qaeda – rubbing tip of nose with right index knuckle – the way india and pakistan are responding – demanding now that Pakistna force out Al-Qaeda – it is close to the worst possible circumstance to do that and Obama did sort of insist that he would go there during the campaing. 

little pain in my chest – I was about to write that my computer logged itself out and I go the pain as I remember that it was n't the machine – I restarted it in order to fix something and must have passed out before getting to log back in – I wonder if someone helped with that – I would've menat to log back in.  - not much of a pain and right side of chest – but I always get a pain in my chest whenever I did anything in the past – coughing up mucus I had in my throat – seemed to line my throat which was slightly sore – but now once it's up – everything seems fine – there was a battle in my throat perhaps last night while I was asleep. 

The Rammificaitons of a Dead High-Level Political Leader
Benazir Bhutto – if someone is asking a question – I was not around – not born – but Kennedy – John Kennedy – oh brother I may get the brothers mixed up – it is John Kennedy as the assassinated president – there was a very large outpouring for him – the ranks are fairly equivalent – it is noted that in Pakistan like a family heads a political party and that that is a bit different from the US – and it does have  rammifications – that it is more like a defined group where as in the Us SUPPOSEDLY you pick your political party based on your own political leanings and it can happen where a marriage – the partners in a marraige belong to different poliical parties -  but with that said – it may well be a bit contrived – or the party – the followers of bhutto may make sure her death is remembered and it may not be fully genuine sympathy for her-  I cannot discern that for sure-  that is done in the US and with John Kennedy his supporters gave him a very positive obituary which is taught in schools to my knowledge and negative issues with his presidency are omitted- and yes I use to run by a picture of him in someone's window like he was a saint and this was in 2004 and that is many – 30 years – 40 years after his death – whatever amount of the outpouring is fake or real – it is fairly normal for certain high level leaders to have that-  not all – but in a shooting in(it) can happen – resting forehead on right thumb – there is little out of the ordingary here – and with basic rief a year out – there is little that could be done that woudl constructively help if there was – how strong the movement around her family is – that could be an issue – like it is preferable if the partty has the famiyl but reevaluates its position with respect to the voters – changes with time – versus staying a personality cult around the former prime minister – it is too early tell that- the reaction today could well be perfectly genuine- and that is probably healthy if it is – like Senator Wellstone – who died in a plane crash in MN – and there was anger – and I am not going to say that it was all unjustified – he was apparently a very strong critic of the Iraq war in 2002 – which is early to criticize it – he died on a plane crash – his family was very mad about it – there was an attempt to like get revenge at Bush – blame Bush for the death – and the nomiantion of someone to take his place – his Senate seat was done with anger and rage  and it showed up – they lost their bid for Senate and while the rage I bet is not fully gone – it is not as much of an issue as it could be – but that is US example of where – a tragic death can trigger a response that can be problematic and it is no longer about representing the people of MN – it is about avbenging the death of Senator Wellstone and that becomes a very different government idea and notion  and more like a monarchy.   The individual is a priority over the state.   It stopped after the election in his case – versus continuing – but personality cults over  tragic deaths of political figures can emerge and highyl problematic – Carolin Kennedy  currently-  the Us  MAY NOT B E FINISHED  with the 2008 election  - definitely the “full response” to the 2008 election is not quite finished or handled – but Caroline Kennedy is almost a remnant of President Kennedy's death – actually is a remnant of Kennedy's death – I don;t want to say more- that is a current issue – I want to see what is done – I ahve expressed a few thoughts – it's not really being afraid – my other thoughts on related matter should answer that one and I am in a -  ARE REALLY GOING TO GO HERE MODE -  with the whole topic – and really make 2008 into vengence to God for Kennedy's death? - There is an element of that in the US election – and I  am not certain the national verdict has been fully represented yet – no I don't believe that those who support Jon Kennedy and feel that is how to do things – I do not feel they will win – an assessment was made and he was apparently found lacking by God – and others may not be happy with that-  that was the ruling – and they are trying to declare that null and void 40 years later – and I can't imagine or I just don't believe that idea will stand – and the “dnace” of certain people who would know better is not a dance of defeat – it is more a game – a waiting period with a known outcome – it feels like that – it's very werid and eeries – like you are waiting for the sun to rise in the hobbit and turn all the trolls to stone – it is like that- and you know the sun will rise or you pray it will – and you tell the trolls you have to change or you'll turn to stone – and they believe they are so powerful that they don't listen to you and you keep warning them and the sun eventually comes up and they are all stone as predicted – the Us is sort of like that right now -as everyone proclaims what they are proclaiming – i do not think that will be the final word on things.  Even if – the Republicans could have won the election if they wanted to – they did not fully try to win – there is some reason for that – Bush is still president – we keep talking about what can be done – locking up political adversaries which with presidential emergency pwoer can be done.   Building of suspense is the best way to describe it – I am personally not terribly happy with this – but others want this and some may have good reason.  Fingers are getting numb while typing – this is a first – seems to try to prevent me from typing.  - i am done with this section 21:45 Est 12/27/08

I Hate him – Just Because ? 
FOX – now I know why I don't always watch the news – I could go at this head one and go through both the India Pakistan issue and the Gaza strip and the viewing of the Iranian president and give an honest and direct opinion – perhaps in some ways that would be best – in others – I am not a frontal opinion – direct and more confrontational approach serves things best – I do have a reaction -

I think that with sincerity those that can resolve whatever differences they have with governmental rhetroic and policy versus actual confrontation have a done service if it is likely the basis for the confrontation is misunderstanding.  It would be highly helpful if certain situations did not go farther – it does seem my media is making more of certain things than it needs or reporting movement as hositle and angry which may or may not be -

It would be nice to have more information on the rationale for why a certain group initiated terrorist attacks – I would also be highly interested to know how killing 500-1000 people is going to encourage peace for that – and I have to acknowledge not undestanding a lot about why things are done – it is not apparent from the facts of 100 rockets sent in 225 people killed in response- more retaliation threatened – that is the US version – I have a feeling there is more to it – if in south central Los Anegles – there was a policy of like shooting 10 people for every person who was killed of a certain group and that was the way to acheive justice – why is there not a functioning justice system – may be question number one – would you not try to determine who is responsible in the singular versus blaming the group – and I have to admit – I guess Gaza in part of the Palestinian authority or whatever it is – which is not really a coutnry but is and is not really part of Israel but is – that seems to be the problem – the “gray area” - that seems rather obvious as a problem – one may wonder why the “gray area” has not been better resolved – it does usually take two to tango – again in the end more information would be nice – there is a reaction to hearing 500 people were killed for one person and that that is okay – it may not be 500 – it was 225 – I thought that was just one attack – I would also suspect the count is not finished yet – I am trying to imagine like if 500 canadian died – or I will make it 225 canadians died for the attack on 1 american – or vice versa – what immediate implications that would have for foreign relations.   Iran was blamed for the attack – perhaps that si true – there was no trace of how Iranians funded it or what they used to aid the Palestinians – it may well have been true – there was little to substantiate that – Iran was guilty pretty quickly with little evidence. 

I thought it was better to get the opinions of world leaders and not shut them out – it is a fair test of Western openess-  the Dutch cartoonist should have free speech rights – and one may find his cartoon more like some of the political cartoons I saw in the Pittsburgh City paper – Rall is a good example – very one sided – The Iranian leader was giving an opinion on Crhistianity-  we critized the Muslims for not being tolerant of free expression – yet we criticize the Iranian leader for exercising a right to an opinion of our religion – or that was done on FOX – is that not a double standard?  No – no one was killed-  but there wasn't – I dsiagree because from FOX – it was how dare the Iranian leader make such a speech – silence him – actually that was the former Israeli ambassador speaking -

The Israeli ambassador had an awful to say – about how Ahmadinejad will start the next holocaust – is bent on nuclear weapons – and has killed my brits, Us , and Israelis – soem of that may be true – many of the statements such as – Ahmadinejad only has brought evil to the world – very emotional biased and prejudiced statements – with no justification – just – we think you are evil – I am aware the newscaster seemed in full agreement – you can tell sometimes by tone and diction used by the impartial journalist – but he did not make a comment verbally he asked questions and did not go beyond that-  but I found the comments of the former israeli ambassador filled with words designed to instigate hate againt the Iranian leader and without much justification – it is hard to give a great deal in a newscast – he did stray off facts and make wild assumptions – particular on the nuclear issue – but the ahmadinejad only can do evil – the comment like that was there – that was an interesting statement – and he didn;t include chanukah in his end greeting just christmas and new years -  - I was going to write elsewhere that is bothers me that the coutnry is fracturing on whether you say merry christmas or something else during this time of year – I was unaware until colonel Oliver North – did it – just how big an issue that is – I have never implied peopel will be denied the right to say merry Christmas – but i should bother people that part of the  country feels it is almost national or part of national pride to say merry Christmas  - and the other part cringes and won't use that statement – I will not use Merry Christmas in general and yes it is true in the post office I am sure I was asked twice because it was clear I was avoiding saying merry christmas and kept answering happy holidays – I do not like saying merry christmas anymore-  my head will not implode if I do say it – but it does leave others out inlcuding really myself - - but yeah like that whole trend where it is a big issue to say merry xmas or merry christmas or not – that is a frightening thing – sorting the country into 2 camps – scratching right shoulder with right hand as I write that-  that is another action that is on my watch list that endangers the coutnry separating inot two pieces which we decided 140 years ago would not happen – and there is no valid reason now – the factionalism has been fomented to a crisis pitch – and that has to now end – or be curtalied- and it has to be cuaght or if people would just speak out when they see it – and call people on what they do – they can speak – but not let it go unanswered when there is a speech designed to split up the country – left and right people do that and apparently with the intention to split up the US which until several weeks ago I would have thought unfathomable – but if people want to try it – then their arguments need to be examined and if possible – refuted to mollify those who follwo that line of thinking.   It has gone on unanswered and that is the problem.   - even the heritage foundation was against Iran first without too many questions asked as to why – jsut back up your statements – when people start in – this man is a dictator – is a threat to the world – etc – etc – why – with people I don;t like – who are pbulci figures – I can point to policies and directthings that have happened tha bother me – with I would like it to not sound like – I hate him just because.

onmy third – no I ahve had 3 silverfish in the last 2 days.   For a high rent district we do have pest issues – I know others think that is me – but I do notice. 

Ya know if lectures were on video – a professor wouldn't necessarily have to give them every year – just have the students look at the lectures and then handle questions -  Tehre are some people who would prefer to do research – who have to spend a great deal of time lecturing. 

as a nifty idea military equipment need not be built by the same exact people all the time – that was then and this is now and the issues in the auto industry have been there for decades – to me you are hanging onto tradition and not looking at economics – and I guess I'm not going to be listening much tonight. 

you can't afford to pay retirement out of profit – wouldn't it depend on what you promised – it was based on a lower life expectancy after retirement -   the steel industry of course disappeared and was unionized -  isn't the union guilty of not getting the CEOs to save the retirement fund – shouldn't they have done that? 

unemployment is 6% or 7%  it is halloween year round right now. 

um aren't public officials hand's tied while they are in office – like many Republicans who wanted to do things stepped down in 2007 and 2008 – Keep your friends close and Keep your enemies closer as the saying goes.  - asking all Republicans in ceratin federal departments to stay on – it is a way to control them.  

An Odd thiing to be Viewing on Youtube
while I do not mind seeign jsut about anything and definiteyl those things from different religions are welcome- if I look at too much from the Qu'ran – I will begin to have a very odd profile as an American – my wieing habits- whiel they attract attentions now – no one can go farther – somewhere – where I can't see – someone is trying to make me into a terrorist- make me look like a terrorist- the poems on the Qu'ran yesterday are alright – but I will draw the line for now- now is not a good time for  me to be exploring the sacred versus of Allah and leave a computer trail of it – and be saying things that someone can construe as anti-semitic- they will use all of that and label me a fascist terrorist which is an excellent way to get rid of me – which leaves no blood on their hands – fully discrediting me is now probably an objective as they cannot afford to let any of my theories or ideas have any credibility or it may be a risk to plans – either I am insane or I am a terrorist – but they will try for one of the two – that also means that any traceable violence will be off limits for them against me – that will implicate them in taking me out as a threat and they will never live that down – it has to fully look like an accidental – and an accidental bombing by a military plane or even an odd gas fire where the whole house goes up – that will be suspicious given the history – resting forehead on first two index fingers – but they will try something or try to think up something – but for now – no Islamic versus on youtube or something that in the US can be construed as terrorism – that is what they are looking for.  Some way to label me a terrorist and get rid of me.. 

Order logic and efficiency – we have heard for many years hwo evil that is – to prise order and rational thought over “being human” and being subject to be being swayed by emtions – what started that idea – as rational thought is superior – and now people are fighting it tooth and nail – being human is better – but I have been arguing before that is a cop out-  being a prisoner to too much emotion is a bad thing and leads to poor decisions being made – not being honest with oneself – It started when an evil empire seemed basedon order and rationality and it was stereotyped as that as being ordered – that is the stereotype of that time – it is ordered – it is what happens when there is too much rational thought – it's why you need comfort food and religion and to be “human” - if you embrace logic you become like those evil people – over there -  YET THAT ORDER WAS NOT AT ALL BASED ON LOGIC – OR YES – NOT PRIMARILY BASED ON LOGIC – THE DRIVING FORCE FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS NOT RATIONALITY – BUT REVENGE AND VENGENCE THE FARTHEST THING FROM LOGIC – SO THE NAZIS OF WWII ARE NOT IN ESSENCE A STAIN ON LOGIC AND COLD HEARTED SCIENTISTS -  the ego and the emotions was and are and may be i nthe future the big problems-  having good judgment which is the basic of logic always makes sense – there is not a counterexample – what you will find is an example where some fact is overlooked or something claimed to be true is false and the person used poor logic and would not look at that – being swayed by emotion is a bigger problem and is a way – making people to be swayed by emotion is  a way to ensure you can control them – And that was done a lot in WWII – and there isn't much logic in that in thousands of people saluting or going – yes we can, yes we can.   The two phenomena are not terribly different they do get a little bit frighteningly similar.   Legailize pot as the primary thing the US government should do – are there no starving in Haiti - - is there no threat in the middle east and part of Asia? -  Is there a world recession and we should legalize pot first.   Because of course it benefits our population to be stoned. 

I have noticed that if someone wanted to spare their chilren war – then you wouldn't do things to antagonize the other side to fight you – looking at maps for 50 years and how they have changed in ownership – you don;t know that will cause trouble – and yet it keeps happening? -  One has to know that if you do that a few of your own will get lost in the fight – but the major reason  Ican see that one would keep doing that is if their loss were not considered a big factor – if the objective was not to spare life – but instead to gain territory – then the strategy employed for 50 years makes a great deal of sense – but the cost is very high.   And yes it has rammifications that shall we the US pro-life would never approve a strategy like that – a war of attrition strategy like that – where you know – it's going to be a certain way – you cannot not know that -  Where else does a different value system lead to - 

In the US certain people injure their children to get sympathy and start charities it appears – which are income sources – certain things are not completely unthinkable given what does go on – or fundraising by having or pushing into existence a Santa Claus massacre in CA – and that will help fundraising for certain groups – and yes with other recent incidents there is a pattern.   Human life is not a primary value to some.  - winning the objective is. 

I Call the Cards and I bet I will See the Smurfs Today
if someone was asking – if the US had nuclear technology alone – the rosemburgs did not give the secrets – I note that is you are not a top competitor – and you desire to be so – it is in your interest to play the competitors off against one another in order to weaken them – you would prefer not to have a world power who clean up everything and fix and straighten out everything – even if benign – IF your desire is to be the head power – and you are not it – if you are not head power and desire to be so – a lone superpower who is not bound by others due to superior financial or technological strength is not in your interest – you would act against that superpower to weaken its position so that – if it is alone – you cannot easily use another force to manipulate it – it no longer needs to play the rock paper scissors game of international diplomacy – done bluff –reprissal and reward -  if the US had a technological advantage like nuclear weapons it could have dictated to stalin or whatever other leader terms of any agreement – or there was that threat – Europe and Us could dictate world structure and they may not have done so in a terrible fashion – I would like to believe my country and some its allies are not inherently evil – BUT if certain national problems are resolved – international issues are resolved another group – not a foreplayer cannot use them later – a minor player who is good at manipulation would despise a supreme authority who could dictate its terms – it has now happened at least 2 times – the current one and the technology issue – yes those are two noted blips – I am sorry – but if someone is suggesting that connection – I do see it – is there a force in the US that did not want it gain global supremacy – not for a good reason like it would be destructive – but for the reason of – THEN there is nothing to use to manipulate the US with – the US will be hard to manipulate because it no longer will need to play a game – I guess – germnay 1917 -  I am almost starting to wonder about the French  and their Revolution – I wish I did not see it – I do – and I would be lying if I said otherwise-  and someone could think that way – that as long as they destroy the major powers – there is a chance in time their base of power will grow to be the greatest – coopt and cajole – versus using direct force – grima wormtongue – I am sorry – if you go and investigate and you get a yes on that – I am aware that that may alter things- my own case suggests it is possible – the planning – the careful manuevering - - I never desired to be the person who blow thewhistle on the world – no I didn't get it could be that big – rubbing forehead a little – somewhat in disbeleif – but using right middle finger – they can point to numerous successes to say it works – if you don't look at the cost – just that the objective of destroying someone else can be acheived and has been – itching back of neck right side with right fingers – Blowing up the Wrold to elevate yourself – no – please no – If we thwart or if the current drama is blocked and I still have hope and reason to believe that what is going on publicly in the US is not going to be the outcome – we will find out and call the cards as things will get exposed if the plot fails – with what is currently known and who can be tied to what.   - wow – tell me if you see other instances – or od as you see – but it is there – it has now happened twice at least or the depression – one might wonder aobut that as well – and – without the german holocaust which the US could have prevented and perhaps if someone else were in charge would have – would there have been international political will to let other things happen after the war?   Itching right thigh with right fingers.  

I'm curiousa as to how this listing
Why Fantasy Football Matters: (And Our Lives Do Not) by Erik Barmack and Max Handelman (Paperback - Aug 1, 2006  - got into a search for dungeons and dragons specified for science fictiond & fantasy and further specified for gaming – both of which should have excluded this – 11:01 EST 12/27/08

maddock's financing aking away money from one part of an innocence project-  it is quite possible that certain parties framed people and do not like the framing undone by DNA evidence.  I guess I should be clear on that – that – maddock has to solicit customers – which can very well mean he knows what they have holdings of.

Global Warming Logic Back at ya
I am sure being in the US military will be fine - I think it will be just like being at home - as the military is very much like my mother- both wish me ill and try to kill me at times or cause bad things to happen to me and yet I have to keep in touch and communicate with both of them - and that is a shared semi-uniqueness that they both have.  so the military will be just like home-  that's an example of Global warming logic

in rwanda's case the Uk has email - the Us has a contact form - the US got the longer message - but I will use the UK unless the email gets blocked and I have to switch it - which has happened several times in the past within last couple months - and before-  but mainlyi n last couple months-  though it appears someone made a deal to stop that - as it has occurred in a few weeks.

repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – the refresh however came back to a much older place- I didn't fully realize they could do that – I sort of did – but they demonstrated – like it all depends on what i opened up before session quitting and as I opened a lot they had more to work with – not all a bad – but like when I closed it there were 5 windows open – or when I killed- they brought back a time when I had it looks like 11 or 12 windows open and one was youtube on fern gully which was closed hours ago – 2 radio streams – and then the embassy of erwanda in uk and US with it's sound trek – actually those are all from different places – I think I had down 5 windows when I closed – I did not have up fern gully – I can't believe that – so they pick from whatever I have up – whatever – not hard to rearragne it – it is slowing me down or I am choosing to write this up and not doing the double I wanted to do with a new contact quickly- I bet it will not be a problem and I will amend that now 7:45 EST 12/27/08 – also a test to see if I would risk turning down the dial of volume on my speaker and then forgetting – because that is how it happens – when I want the sound down fast – they were shooting for that with me forgetting about or that I would be too nervous and leave it up while finding the windows o turn off as with 12 you do have to hunt to find which windows have sound eminating from them

Bus Technology
no on magnetic bus technology – rubbed right eye with knuckle of thumb – one the expense is an issue – two – it's been a while – but wacko things do happen when you have a lot of bus routes where you need this bus to go these extra stops all of sudden that are off it's route  and need this bus to cover this part of this other busses route - - rubbed nostrils with right index knuckle a line above -  a guidance system based on bus placement – does not allow flexibility in a larger bus system – you do not want busses to operate like a train – uh – road block – for whatever – how do you deal with that – it can'
t shut down the line- the infrastructure build up also sounds bad – this is another wondrous CA idea or it is being tried out in CA – unless it gets the above problems resolved-  and it is a location specific hands free guidance system – which means it will have trouble solving the above problems – then I cannot recommend that – still a little stomach trouble from last night- if you dedicated certain city streets to transit vehicle only – then this has a chance of working – I don't like that either-  busses can serve to integrate suburban and urban experiences – with the cost of this technology I would bet doing a suburban bus route is trickier – they did have those in Pittsburgh – and I used those a lot – this technology will help make suburban bus routes harder – I don;t know that for a fact-  but if you have to add magnets to the street in order to use it – then a long route becomes cost problematic – plus if a magnetic malfunctions and the guidance fails – what happens? - in the suburbs the web of support is thinner  - no on this and passing gas as I write that.   Which helps get it out of my stomach  - sleep deprivated  again last night which will help prep for a heart attack it is what they did last time.  They are trying to deprive me of sleep for longer.  3:33 ES 12/27/08

- Sickness by Gummy Beas - they are the Likely Candidate
2:14 EST 12/27/08 – I was sick again with diarrhea and spent some time in the bathroom trying to let whatever clear out of my stomach – diarrhea by gummy bears from NYC – and you used the “we want you as a new recruit” piece of jim henson that was used so long ago in pittsburgh – ho ho – and I was willing to forgive my mother just as she aided in getting me poisoned before bed – though there was some additional help later or I would not have eaten them right before – I was “asked” to eat them before bed – so you got to play with my oversized stomach and give me diarrhea despite eating my mother's cooking – next – and saying I showed poor judgment by agreeing with a premise of the film and at least at the end of the film saying that if you didn't want to prosecute mother – that was alrigth with me – when she is guilty as sin  - though I can't fully see that from where I sit - - wasn't a great judge there – though you were suggesting a course of action not presenting a case – usually when a course of action is sugested they are not asking for my sign off-  but I am too soft – of course – if we do what is recommended by law – there will be an awful lot of dead military personnel – by military law so perhaps one should not be so critical of my “softness” - your life may depend upon it later adn there is a bigger justification for not inflicting full justice in every case as will be seen.

- there is like gas in my stomach – not pain  in an area but as – I do have to pass gas an awful lot tonight – I was buying things – but now like an upset stomach – like having gas bubles in the stomach that need to come out.  - uncomfortable to lie on the stomach.  Nowq pain in abdomen 22:16 EST 12/26/08 – now pain at top of rib cage – tonight is the stomach and related muscles – it was a bout of constipation – nearly diarrhea – it has been a while since everything came up by mouth or rear end – but that has been done in 2005 and 2007 - - the alst things I ate were of course either given to me or prepared by mother dearest.   - Stomach still somewhat upset.  - didn't cough up phlem today – just started to again – now – watching monster maker – and thinking maybe I could forgive mother – and she put up two small tins of food- two things she got me – after eating one of them – is when I got sick.  Nice to be loved.  Her objective is to get me to hate her – that is the plan.  Take away any feeling I have of mercy – so I then have to wonder if a certain video tonight was by the other side – as to get out any feeling of mercy I ahve to mother – showing me it is there and then trying to get rid of it – it must be necessary to get rid of any feelings of mercy I have in order to instill enough rage in me to get me to do irrational things.  - some times the higher class the tin – the more likely the infection deandeluca.com – sugar is a good medium for bacteria.

Respecting religious buildings as sactuary – specifically religious worhsip areas as places of sanctuary-  I agree that just extending that – period and then having someone shoot at you from a mosque or a church or a synagogue – or a kiva – to broaden things – is not acceptable – get every mosque or not to have a freudian slip  - but every religious center to have a conract with the controlling force that if they want to be a sanctuary they must abide by certain terms – no weapons in the building – anyone with a weapon is turned away-  has to give up the weapon to use the sanctuary – it has to be a palce of neutrality in which case it is respected – if it is not – then other agreements come into play or it can be treated as an enemy position if that is appropriate-  now I know that can be abused – so can it's sanctuary status – yes the Us military can lie – but so can others – bombiing of buildings in recent conflicts has not been terribly effective at ending them – only to a limited degree – but yes in future – if you like use a mosque as a missle silo – it's neutrality need no be respected – it should be taken into account if possible that the mosque or church may not have full control over being used as a military base – but it is war and that is the line – the worship space should have as little as is possible to do with the military campaign – obviously humanitarian aid is almost part of being a worship space, but only things like that should be allowed not cool – I cna site the US plane through mirhab niche – that is not the intent of respecting places of worship.  And yes it can happen that the military could trump up evidence to blow up a shrine just to do so and create evidence to suggest weapons – the military is supposed to be educated with ethics- I unfortunately know that that doesn't always happen -  IT IS SUPPOSED TO – AND IT IS UNETHICAL IN THE US SYSTEM TO FALSIFY A JUSTFICIATION TO BOMB SOMEONE  - so for now that is the check – in time perhaps we can havea war with full civilty where the chruch or mosque could compalin if propoer procedure were not followed- but that is unlikely to be there for a while – however documenting devices for abuses do exist these days in rather portable fashion – having accountability in a war is still a difficult thing – I ahve no firm answer than to do your best to ensure your side does not wage a war in a way that that is not something you can justfiy to your grandchildren – not be proud of – but you can justify well – I picked a certain standard – because little is there to be proud of in some of the events in a war.   But for now – you have to rely on the best ethics possible of the other side and do your best to ensure your own – given the need to do your best to usually win and end a conflict.  It is not easy.

why is civil war racism particularly improtant now – because TX didn't for Obama – see I worry about that-  I mean why is this an objective decision to bring up TX dirty laundy and do they do the same with the North – like Banking scandals in the North and those do exist and some of neato things- a northern insurance guy came up with having secret spies on his clients and he started that idea – I mean Pbs could do documentaries on the pecuniary habbits of Boston and NYC if it is so enamored with the racism of the south when saiyng the south is more racist now – one could wonder on that – there isn't really an event one can point to – they are republican and they voted Republcan and NC voted Obama – to my chagrin – it is a way to foment the separation of the states – to help along the narrative that the south and north are different and I will call pbs on yellow journalism

Forest Carter KKK founder – in TX – and Pbs is doing a documentary on him – it is a way to cast Texans and southerners as provincial and show the superiority of Boston and New York – or one does not know for sure-  it is an interesting choice – do we show negative figures to come out of the North and NYC and Boston as well ? - I don;t even know of one – yet – polticial forcing is clearly not new to NYC – um in my case I know of NYC and boston people who are prejudiced and have issues-  but I don;t even know of northern bigots and oddly they don't have any – and no I don;t buy that- from my youth – how about a story by PBS on how people in NYC reject people from other parts of the country as inferior- for not having proper education and proper appreciation of the NYC arts scene which is vapid and doing very little productive for the arts now and yet they do fell – it is THE CITY – the place of knowledge and they do live in that DELLUSION – asnd that they no longer are critical to ensure a quality turism to experience and to needs of society in their art – and yes it is odd to me that it is okay to pick a racist of TX and do a doucmentary on that-  all knowledge is valuabel – there are no northern skeletons – how about Rockefeller and Carnegie – and the way they - “forged the nation” - the dea lworkers struck when working for them – that is history too – and how the robber barons helped ensure unions would form. 

One could apparently look into HOW Obama got elected to the US Senate too – he didn't shall we say have a high political firefight.. 

2 for 1 are always good with a kfyo story – I was said the nation was going to be 2 nations for 1 below a little.   It could be a reference because saying 2 for 1 after christmas- you don't normally hear that – that is no so common – 18:57 EST 12/26/08 – it is a common retail remark – it is not so common a reference when talking down about after Christmas sale markdown prices – first time I heard it in any year – instead of percent 2 for 1 after christmas – we do want to break the union – uh -huh -

BTW – I didn;t hear all of it – but the new envrio- hot air division of the Jim Lehrer wind farm division  was blowing fast and furious in tonight's broadcast – that does happen. 

one of my first memroies the shocked me in TX was going to the West End isn't it of Dallas and – it may be the East End – and there is a mall there and when I first went there  - there was a roullette wheel in the bottom floor – and I was shocked to see that mixed with the rest of the mall.   You would never see that in New England we publicly disapprove a great deal of gambling which is why Ledyard CT with its Native American Gambling Casino is so scucessful – there is little competition or there was. 

someone has to “readjust” his prescription and get the wax out of his ears if he thinks there is no message in the movie other thanthe plot in “bolt” - the trailer says enough  without seeing much more.

if someone like bolt as a movie and thought there were no messaages in that – and I am pretty sure I dsiagree with that- but despite that – what does one think of “fern gully” which is another cartoon but slightly in a similar veing to me-  forest and animals good – people evil.    Why do  ibet as a tiger or as a deer one never has a moment's peace in a “peaceful forest”  ? 

seem to have gotten shut off of firefox and I didn't remember doing that -

starting watching a movie on youtube – that I might like hadn't seen it before – kfyo – suddenly came on 14:45 EST – jolting me out of the movie.  - I guess kfyo was on – but that “bug” kept it silent untill now

and yes being a diverse coutnry benefits the Us – HOWEVER – fomenting regionalism in the country with a program funded by federal dollars or one tha actually helps break the country on regional lines and that became part of the intent – this region is the right way and this region should just follow us-  and in honesty that is not fully true – the north was only right on certain things – not on all of them – and that was allowed to stand – a nationally funded one regbion over another where that region wasn't fully right.  That was allowed to stand for decades.  Resting forehead wih right index finger joint in nose bridge ? - right between the eyes and right middle index figner joint on forehead. 

yes and a new addition that I didn't finalize who got a small email – luckily not a larger one – I messed – or I don't know – but I'm no planning to give that new country -the larger one – I forgot to delete the name – oddly and emailed the coutnry – even though I put a hold – I had the name up on the screen before-  and forgot to get rid of it – and just didn't think for a second – and mother was out a door when right after the small mailing of a page-  - I deleted the name from approval – so that the larger mail is not compromised- if I am wrong and you want that country let me know – but from what I said before – it seems a red herring or more appropriately a trojan email.    And the page or two I just mistakenly sent to him is not as damaging – the listing of other countries is regrettable – it is clear the person I haven't emailed yet and least want to – already knows most of that.   Scratched back of neck with right hand as I deleted that country from contact list – to prevent further emailing.   - Why do  bet I will now find out you wanted them emailed- well I will wait.  - as one small edition – like I can feel her trying at every move to like thwart me – it is highly unique to like feel it palpably almost – where they try a move on you and you can feel it – that want to sabotage yo uand when you block it even a little you can almost feel the anger at denying them victory.

I get to have all the nice thoughts – I do realize that – for the PBS educational programming in general I would like it to be to have been better  - after that I can say this show did a better job here than that show did and I can say if I had a kid I would pick these shows over these shows to be available, but that doesn't mean the first point is not true first and foremost – and lastly I do notice the multicultrual theme – that is built up today on commercial TV – but it started on PBS – where the exclusion of the rural half of the country and white christian males began – and it is clear on just about every children's show – they have diverse casts – there are few – there no representatives from the midwest – the entire cast could have been pulled from Boston or New York city – while it is very true – or it does appear quite true my expereinces that discrimination against minorities is real – with the multi-cultural model of PBS – the nation was sold a bill of goods that was false-  PBS did not in net help to end discrimination – or it had very mixed effects – while it gave jobs to people in TV who might normally not get jobs -  IT IS A BIG ISSUE THAT REMAINED UNADDRESSED THAT NO ONE LOOKED AT IT AND SAID IT DOESN'T REPRESENT HALF OF AMERICA – WHERE THIS BECOMES HIGHLY IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WE MADE A SHOW FEW WOULD WATCH IN THE SOUTH OR WHERE VIEWING PATTERNS AND APPROVAL OF DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY DIFFER HIGHLY – PBS NET HELPED TO SCHISM THE COUNTRY – BECAUSE IT'S INFLUENCE IS STRONG IN HALF OF THE STATES AND MUCH WEAKER IN THE OTHER HALF AND PBS TO A LARGE DECIDED TO ONLY REPRESENT HALF THE COUNTRY  - there is almost an assault on white men at PBS – is that any worse than excluding blacks – I notice the net result – in the North as I remember PBS is okay and considered a source of knowledge – it seems that in the South it is not respected – the north of course called the South backward for not accepting their enlighened state and because of the civil war no one questioned that the south was wrong – BUT – the north did not include much of the country in PBS which is a government station – and the value system of over half the coutnry was shut out or excluded and Pbs in essence practiced prejudice – the rammficiation has been it has shaped the population in certain areas with the children – but not in others and has fomented the deep schisms in the country because onyl select populations watch it – and all because no white man would say- they're aren't many or any in childrne's programming people who look like me – it would have been considered a prejudicial remark – there are some white men – they're city men – they're not farmers from the midwest – certain male archetypes are completely gone from PBS childrens and yet highly prevelant in other areas of society and somehow PBS “missed” that – I do wonder if they in part wanted to foment the schisms – someone did behind the scenes and to acheive that objective painted the rationale for the programming in the language of multi-cultruism – so that anyone who was objecting was racist-  yes PBS now is on in other parts of the coutnry – ti is clear that in some southern circles it is not watched at all and considered bad programming – as a national station – in addition the conservative stations are clearly step children to the main broadcasting stations in Boston, New York, and DC all of whom have certain poltiical leanings – thee was racism towards blacks and there were moves to address that – maybe some intended to work and some were intended to fail on purpose – the rural person was left high and dry and resolving urban and rural tensions was put largely on the back burner.  And we ahve the result of now – Why did certain white archetypes get so heavily missed in PBS ? - in the children's programming ? - I have a hard time believeing that was done was no intent – that it just happened.  Someone “Wanted to make up for things “ - no – not even that will work – especially now with watching the transition to comemrcial telelvision of the mutli-cultural ideal – that still does not well address stereotypes across regional lines – it jsut happened too easily and too smoothly for it to all be accidental – that the pieces of society ahve been pushed further and further apart – look at the rules for creating sub- species in a species in biology-  different mating patterns – social patterns-  we allowed national things to create regional sub-patterns – like that should be done very carefully – there could be local programming – but yeah no one saw that there was and is little representation in the hiearchy of PBS in non- north urban america? - which is okay for San francisco which is not to different – but like Fresno probably is as is Tulsa. 

FOX not getting a certain amount of sleep is not necessarily a disored(disorder) and the truth is – certain groups in our society would prefer less active people to more active ones – i e – do the work we tell you to do and then go home and do nothing else – the unions like the idea of using the need for sleep to increase number of drivers needed to get more jobs out of the same contract – for truckers nad pilots-  they will use this survey to get more union jobs which have healthcare benefits and can fund the doctors' high salaries – and yes they don't someone like me playing around for 24 hours a day and they ahve to have people watch me or that is their thinking and training people to sleep more not less makes that job easier versus an activer person 24 hours a day or even 20 versus 16 – they want to encourage drones who go to sleep early and don't learn to think and be curious. 

is it bauxite or is it blood bauxite like blood diamonds – normally one would pick one's messengers after electing a leader I would think

architecture – 3-2-1 contact – I saw the segment – I didn't the shwo was perfect – I said it was better than some of what we have now – architects do little with structure – you do have to understand it – but the engineers do that much of the time and there is a lot they do  and the segment was completely misleading – that isn't really architecture what they talked about – it is engineering – fiiting the floor plan in with the mechanical system – THAT is architecture part of it – going the development of a floor plan – the evolution of a floor plan – the renditions of it – and why it was changed – that is much truer to what an architect deals with – and you coudl show the other side where architects and contractors yell at each other over “value engineering” - which is real as well – but visually in a confined space – it woudl be truer to show how a floor plan changes from intial idea to final product and the story behind the changes – maybe just a piece of the floor plan – you can might want to leave the traditional part where the architect sits on the project for at least 6 months so that client is more desperate to complete the building so that they will shut their mouths and change their mind less often – desperation tends to give clients clearer heads or make them argue less – so it is a strategy to purposefully make a project late to reduce design changes which are not lucrative.   You get paid for designing and completing a building not redrawing and redrawing plans.  - and on the other one – while you do think about furniture-  I never and none of my bosses ever picked out appliances or go to that level of detail – that is what a furniture designer and perhaps a contractor would do – it can happen - - they skipped blueprints completely – which would have been closer – in the furniture they did touch them – but they weren't hoenst- in 1988 – in 1998 I couldn't punch a few key strokes and raise a countertop 4 inches – you could but not the way they showed it – where the computer showed you sue mistakes- that is total bunk – I even wodner hwo that got in there – like it give the impression the computer would tell you of bad uses of stuff- and it doesn't that is all heresay on contractor or architects part and half the time they don't fully understand what a client does or wants  when it comes to actual use-  they go on their own assumptions which may or may not be the right ones – really a business owner should design his or her own store and same with the house and that should be possible in the future – as CAD gets more realistic -  - itching near left armpit by should with right middle finger -  like doctors and lawyers and archtiects and teacher shoudl disappear – and i ntheir place industries that allow people to do those services for themselves better should pop up – because with technology that can better explain the rammificatiosn of this or that move – the middleman – the professional is not necessary – if you want to treat this illness – this this and this are required - - diagnosing the illness – a machine could do that – teachign a subject the knowledge can be supplied in a patterned fashioned – testing can be made into a pattern – frequently asked questions for students with the material can be anticipated and answers provided – less need for a teacher – seek out the resources that provide the teaching material – for you want to learn and then take the tests you want to qualfiy as knowing what is needed to be able to take a certain job – contracts there are already people that use do-i yourself legal services – I don;t know the quality but half of the problme with law is understanding its nuances and more effort might be made in aiding that understanding and having people use devices – mechanical or jsut clearer written material  to create their own contracts or whatever is needed – for housing and designing building – good 3d cad with walk through could allow the enduser to design the building and know what they are getting which is the big problem the client uses the architect to translate their ideas onto paper correclty-  not all archtiect want to be good translators of the client's will and not all are good translators of the clients will – onyl specialized needs of professionals will be left and their energy will be used elsewhere.    I nreality in archtiecture that has already happened – most house plans are not drawn by architects and people with less education and that is a good thing-  in law and medicine the existing legal infrastructure prevents such farming out of work.   Teachers are doing the same – using laws to prevent experiments in education.   Yes people will lose their jobs- but there will be other jobs – if farmer's in the 1800s worried about losing jobs-  we wouldn't have any machines today – same anology I used yesterday.  We could be cutting wheat with scythes today and have laws preventing tractors from ploughing fields.  

very few people can give a 60 and 90 year perspective on things – see things in such a context – it's the worst – I  appreciate that a great deal as I am confronted with a great number of people who see only an immediate context and in my opinion are making very poor decisions – that will affect many people – the old ways can be wrong – can be incorrect – they are not always so – I did think someone would come across as more regal versus more plain spoken – it is there if you look – but it is not strongly emphasized-  that is very refreshing – um this morning watching a WB show on what it is like to pick out clothes – be a fashion designer presenting clothes to an actress to wear for their awards ceremony-  the emmies I guess – and the actress won't look at the clothes directly as she is getting her facial and has cucumbers in her eyes and has all sorts of odd directions for the designer who is showing off her gowns – that make it clear her “touch with reality” may not be too strong – that they portray her as having a personality cult and the point is amde at the beginning that she is famous for one year – gained fame in the last year – while that is fiction – I have heard and I bet there are other example not too far off the mark from that – I appreciate not everyone who could does that  -I meant this to be simple acknwoledge – it's getting into soemthing I see – like it is not so much I want to kill off the current socio-economic system or not – but I want to look at it critically – and when you see that much of the population is not well treated, well fed or well cared for on one end – and then other people own island in the carribean and have lavish parties and they want more – and you do wonder is that what humanity want to do – the current system says that is the epitome – to stay in a hosue with more rooms than you could ever use – to have tons of servants to maintain it and have people just to wait on waiting on you and to excess so that many of them aren't even I bet well employed or fulfilled – but even used – are the parties fulfilling to go to? - I mean is this we can do – best way to utilize our time – but yet the economic system rewards or more accurately creates those people and seems to encourage that – is that what the future should be? - is that a desirable outcome – the Tyco I think it is CEO who is in jail and they described some of the parties he had when he made 100 million a year – which half of what can be made in a year as CEO and then there are investors who can I think make billions in a year – I think someone has done that-  does it all make sense? - Their rationale is in part there is no way to help all the people who are starving – so what not spend it on themselves  - there is some of that in doing that – just in having a very lavish affair – either you are ignorant of things or you have decided not to care – is either a good mindset for the world leaders and yet many of the people in the location or locations prominent in my country who act like that do view themselves as the people who should set global policy – they may not hold the power directly – they apaprently from what other politicians have said publicly-  they are not terribly shy about not only suggesting but directing high level politicians on the actions they must take. 

if I can't hear the radio – can I create – or is it more productive for others to see who tries to get at me? - the latter I would think. 

Meet Me In the Graveyard – TV show on Wb network on line – opens with a guy onlien telling a girl he will commit suicide if she doesn't meet him in the graveyard – also played the first episode-  that was the traler you have to see if you go to the show site – the first episode is about a girl posting a video she is in a mental institution – talkas abotu how nice it is to see someone dancing naked in a video online – is there one of me filmed and put online against my will – woudln't put it past them  -they do – they used like look into my bedroom – but the girl goes on she has what she needs her fahter gives her presents -   I am kind of looking for non-horro stroy things – or not supe dark – why did I try that title – one of the few left i haven't tried – and no I didn't think it was oging(going) to be that -  I am not trying to run into sinister things that resemble what is going on now-  like I used 3-2-1 contact – but if I look at new shows – things I have not seen before- they are very heavily tending toward the dark – when I don;t want them to  - somehow something about the current circumstance comes up – so only past shows or  mostly past shows – are safer and tend to be okay- almost all that is new – there will be some reference to what is currently going on – they made the videos for is that what you think – no – only sometimes – but it is just as easy or with work what could be done is to take videos that I don't and push them into my field of view- that could be done – and try to control what I see – just like if I look for information online – factual information that might be useful in seeing something – and I want to find it on a yahoo search – wanted to find that TX architect named zimmerman that a certain radio talk show host was talking about – all info disappears – there have been several documented cases in the past where info that i thought-  the date that balloon framing stop being in general use is a good example-  there were several cases in the past online where information I wanted through internet searches disappeared – ro was hard to find – the balloon framing thing from a few emails ago is a good example – well if they can flip around articles on the web- definitely that means videos on youtube cna be played with and I know they are – hulu and wb – video sites – they cannot necessarily fully conrol that-  but with money comes influence – in addition – the dictionary-  diaspora – that wondrous day with that dictionary – where every word I happened to glance either related somehow to jews or to guns or some threatening thing – just happened to pick D – at “random” - the same thing was tried with a book i got from Mongoose publishing – game book – called traveller – it was a book of generic npcs with standard descriptions – and randomly flipping through the pages I would seem to see ones jump out at me that cast me in a negative light.  - they can focus your attention on one item over another make you likely to look at one video over another – with a little influence over the selection of videos – that might be enough to convince someone that every video they see is negative- if you pook around long enough it stops – but it is getting through that – first couple waves that is hard. 

every single media stopped – had to reboot firefox – kido – kfyo – wpht – and youtube-  wow – that doens't happen often – usually at least one fo those works – and I couldn't hear the CIA typing osund as It loaded the first time – I did just now – ah I heard mother move – I can tell this is going to be a good day – 9:41 EST – 12/26/08

Glenn – your sub host was corrupt as hell – there was the santa shootign – he did choose to mention metnal health and medication like I don't know 5 times – and then a caller there god and satan – maybe more people follow satan than god -   and if you follow Satan – he was reversing who was on what side as he spoke  21:22 EST 12/26/08 – like when he said more people follow satan – think that was the host- my side is outnumbered is the implication – when the caller was saying people have a choice – either they resist – caller said follow satan and they end of slaughtering a house full of people OR they do the right thing and turn to God and seek treatment and get rehabilitated – that translates to mean – yes we can lean on you – if you do not go to seek healthcare and keep the illusion we want alive – i nwhich case you'll have to go through the treatment – but we will take the pressure off of you and let you have a semblance of a normal life-  under our control as – now that we dictated one of your actions – I  WOULD THINK IT VERY LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO DICTATE ANOTHER  - but if you don't do that – we will keep harassing you until we get to the point where you will perform one of those killings – we know how to go at you and ware down your resistance to giving in to your anger and hatred and we will get to the point in time where we will make you do one of the killings and then commit suicide to hide the evidence that we tampered – that is how mother actions have been going – she feels if she is cruel enough and it is done in a careful way so that in court I will have little and she does go after me as gremlin over and over and cannot prove that – I see the cause and effect – but I cannot prove that so I cannot fully assign the guilt to her and I now know our neighbor is involved – and my uncle – all the nice little presents – gifts from all these people we just met – uncle arthur never sent much during my formative years – odd now – he is active – but they know and it is a thing do – to push people into a state where they commit violence – and the US is close to being ruled by the mob – I am sure most people are given the choice I am or others have been – we are concerned about what you are doing – do what we want you to – if you do – it will be painful but we will tkae the pressure-  once the person agrees of course they are silent to other children who do not know what may await them  - and that person who was a victim of it-  they point out a person at DAM – who used to be a Republican – but became a Democrat – probably with a little help from DAM informing his views – but if you do not do that – they have been successful nearly every time at going after and getting somone like me – and it usually doesn't get out.  I bet it usually doesn't get this far – though I don't know-  this could all disappear – I get that- I may not exist -  I may be alive – but I may not exist as an entity the government recognizes existing. 

Tom Hanks – not Tom Hanks but Tom Cruise in a movie  about a plot to assassinate Hitler and there was that moment on Leno – one for the money , two for the show – and I'll go – the money and the show or illusion need to be protected from me and someone is grealty slowing down my computer the text as it appears on screen – they keep trying to put a darn keeper on me and I keep saying no .  9:07 EST 12/26/08 -  I can tell that initially in 2007 I approached the right source for help in that bloody wacky holloywood church who seemed to be against doctors and medication – but are actually a front and it was designed to tease out my story before i did any harm – AND THE GOVERNEMNT LET'S THEM GET AWAY WITH THAT  - like be the most attractive hooks out there for people who have been abused and don't know any better about the (system or game) – how the game is played – it is really slowing down my words as the appear on screen and I hope that stops or ends soon. 

The pirate thing and China and now others are in on that – rubbing head withj right middle finger as I realize how I corrected this is not how I first wrote it. 

tim russert is featured on aol.com – odd to pick him out of everyone in 2008 to focus on – and yes he is a buffalo bills fan and had dealings with that crowd who are the ones who caused me trouble and the bills in Vietnam had the last soldier who refused their draftpick to die in combat – until the cases in this war – yes we can yes we can 

valerie plame – and then reflecting on all my fun with the ad council and several of the other agencies in the US government who appear to be tacitly supporting the coming which may split the country quite literally.  - have to wonder about you too.   So there was an amber alert on ktrh – yesterday – so what is someone planning for me today ?  Is it the serial killer – aren't you afraid ? - yes – but fear does eventually give way to sarcasm and a what happens happens attitude – as it has been several years like this now.  Fear is like stage 1 – We ar well into the biting sarcasm – how do they plan to kill me or get rid of me this time?  Mom & nipon – friends – boy I don't need any enemies with friends such as these.    What planet am I on? – what country am I in? – just checking. 

feedback in cbn audio stream – twitterring – sort of a trill on notes where there shouldn't be – there isn't usually any trilling on notes in the first noel – can't even not play with christmas songs- as mother did say through the closed door – merry second day of Christmas indeed.  Oringinally 7:40 EST  now 8:25 EST signal fragments at times – the problems have increased.   12/26/08

they are already doing sleep attack – mini ones where I close my eyes and it's 4:53 EST 12/25/08 – and that is what happens – you are more vulnerable to that if you have been sleep deprived. 

the CIA uses tooth extractions to bribe the taliban – ho ho - FOX

exchanging charms as a way – it's liek the postcards – it is a ward(way) to gain power over someone – the exchange of small gifts or giving a small gifts it leaves a psychic impression for the other owner to follow.   She keeps trying to do that – oh it's a nice postcard from paris and mother sent me a postcard from her trip and little bears – she was big on little useless objects growing up – and I did contemplate that buying anything from the compass rose was foolish as that gives them something they can trace back into here..

3:56 only rewceived(received) a few half hour or less snippets of sleep.  I did ask mother to quiet down and I said in terms of – it is now close to 9 pm and is a quiet hour and I would like you tto stop banging on my door and let me sleep – that is not fully madeup – there are generally noise ordinances and there is one like in some places for like conractors no great amount of noise from 7am to 7 pm – you can't work in a person house past 7pm as a conractor in a neighborhood – she did cary for about na houe and apparently psychicly made sure I could not sleep much – which will make today interesting but oh well.  - scratched back of head with right hand as I said this – did you think I would gie in?  - it would be different if that were just a flippant remark- she did go on the balcony and see the plates in my room and tell me I should remove them – and then laster unlocked the door against my wishes and went in my room and removed a plate – so it was a planned thing – perhaps revenge for the last two nights – I stayed up to purchase things-  now I should mention – this is where the other gets its wires crossed – it was my money and my sleep and in both cases I decided to go to sleep when I choose and to buy what I choose-  the reason this is an issue is they had to track me and it would have been difficult for them because they did not want to necessarily to stay up till 3am watching what I was doing-  I did it because it is when the bank cleared money – they blame me for making them stay u- accidentally pasted whole document as a duplicate right here and had to catch and fix the error – going back they blame me for making them stay up all night and having to track me – the thing is they don;t -graphic displays – windows appeared with color swatches for color selection – I didn't want those up - - going back again – they probably blame me for staying up late and making them stay up late to track me – the thing they  don't and shouldn't be tracking me in the first place – they aren't supposed to be tracking me and I will stay up as I please thank you very mu- grpahic window popped with option for word processessing – going back – they aren't supposed to be tracking me at all and I will stay up as I please thanky you very much – so we are where we are – I have had little sleep ity looks like as punishment for making them stay up like if they wanted to track me – screw them – I will do as I see fit with my time and did not appreciate the sleep attacks to make me fall asleep earlier and do not appreciate this now – but I will put up with it  - my vision will blur today it will be a side effect- so be it.  You ahve been told no – you can't bully – mother can't bully me- and none of you accept it – you will – and this is sleep deprivation even if it is managed by gremlins – which falls under torture – remember that.  

cannot sleep  -  and should be able – I suggest one learn the limits of power  - before she moves into   blair house – this is your style – keeping me tired but unable to go to sleep  - it feels like you  - this is also an attempt to get me sick via sleep deprivation.  - they are going for a heart attack – the lack of sleep. 

they – nevermind – the test withou warning thing is getting a little old – no it's not national emregency- you are choosing to flip your cards over fast on me then let me know what is coming – not all of that is needed – you like ot throw surprises at me – if I were to read a certain document that is 227 did I hear 1781 is it? - it's that old – you're not really supposed to keep jolting me like that – and you technically aren't supposed to  - and this is starting to feel like a spur of the moment test – mother did her thing – your responding now – it's good for oyu – well you never convinced me of that.  But whatever – guess I'm not getting sleep tonight either.  00:12 12/26/08

mistype from earlier today or now yesterday - http://www.aazon.com/   10:36 EST 12/25/08 -  chest pains – slight but for a while noe(none).  

snowclouds hang low and threatning – maybe it won't praying it may the brightest fireplace glows in every place  wairting for Christmas – lots can be said in Christmas Carols 23:46 EST 12/25/08  - she closed the bedroom door next to mine – which means she may have deicded to sleep in there – but that is not certain – she has not done that in a month or two where she doens't in her bedroom but in the guest bedroom -  even with that they did not get what they wanted.  I didn't think they'd let Christmas go by – nor new years. 

japanese – humor show on hulu – was about getting a guy to strip naked – young guy – a lot was said and the show was not dubbed into english – odd to find that on hulu in the D's I believe under TV show – rubbed under nose back forth with right index finger   - denpa shonen – it appears

mother broke the lock – or opened the lock with force and came in the room while I was sleeping and removed the dishes – she did so without my permission and she did wake me up as she was next to me removing the dishes – my door was locked – and she was not given  permission o enter.    - She is now yelling and making a commotion outside my door – it is 21:39 EST 12/25/08  - I probably did touch in the shock – she was right next to me as I woke up – standing but she did go there .  (She could have popped the lock) – I don't think I touched her – she should never have been in there – I do routinely leave a finished plate of food in my room until the next day – in Pittsburgh it never was an issue. 

signals  - body gestures – like when typing used to keep track of when distraction and sleep attacks fail when reading 20:28 EST 12/25/08

19:37 EST we are back to sleep games – I did fall asleep just a few minutes ago – mother was trying to encourage I did make a show of fighting when i realized she was doing it – I lost – but I don'y gain anything by staying up tonight – it's probably the worst night for me – because everyone else is away so in the end – I was kind of hoping to catch up on sleep – she immediately came up stairs and asked me how I was doing as I fell asleep waking me up and gainign the dominance attack – it is kind of cheezy – but they are like that – and it shows she is just trying to dominate- she now kisses me if I don't talk to her- it is a psychic signal – my skin will register her lips touching it and someone will know thatI am downstairs – detecting the kiss as different from my touch – you stuck me here.   Just pointing out my happy holiday- now I am fully aroused and won't get to sleep for hours – she also had a successful reading dominance attack – fell asleep leading – she used the cbn radio as the wake up – ironic trick – they do that and have donbe that – knowing when the next song will come on – and that it is sudden  which would wake me- it is going to be a bitter nasty cat fight in this house to the very end – ohhhh kaaay – she is trying to foment enough anger where i want to hurt her- it is the objective – she went there with an implanted thought – she is trying to get me angry enough to hurt her – because she can do nasty things to me and I can't strike back – because in the end I cna't prove it was her -and i don't fully know that- though the coincidence on many occassions is now there -and she strikes at me over and over-  dinner was slightly undercooked – I fixed it to some degree – rubbing sking above chin with right index finer joint as I write this.  She did get in an attack with a question about being asleep or sounding like I was asleep upstairs – in the afternoon – after the reading attacks – I did get to finish the book today-  it is allvery petty and this is the  way – the speaker of the house should be similar to mohter – boh trinity grads.  Otherwise  known as the school for nasty women. 

trouble ar first getting gov.ca.gov - not sure - just didn't go there the pop-up for the governor's site came up and I clicked on that and then it went immediately 12/25/08 18:03 EST


CA Santa(s) for Gun Control -new activist organization coming soon
 FOX – Los Angeles Santa apparently opens fire with a gun at a gathering at a party – the story title was santa massacre – 1 not surprised it was in LA – sorry but they tried to build it's rep with me- but that is induced – people don't want you to like the city so things happen to you – but 2 – CA is being set up to pass a gun control law- and it helps activist group fund raising I swear to foment anger and rage between the different factions in CA – that is done – like the gay issue the same thing -gay marriage-  they're setting it up to happen on guns-  I bet their wil lbe a gun ban or gun restriction of some sort and they are planning it- you can see it – there isn't a better to get people mad than to have a Santa massacre  - I have been circling through my thoughts – noticing how people got an answer to a question or bumped into me and said something- I have forgotten most of them -some are with my parents – but even others – how far back high school it seemed or slightly farther and up to college years which cover a decade with me – itching upper right cheekbone with right index kncukle – thining about chicago – van hogh – not van gogh – in the hostel – when I first got there – and the person who wanted to take me to a movie – never met her before – always testing who you are – I was actually thinking about the secretary in the last job – actually and the 7am phone call by the contractor – I got to work at 7 and got a call from this former military turned foreman and the office didn't open till 8 and that wasn't accidental – and then like the middle school 1996 – and 2000-2003 period where things were a little weird-  people don;t oddly bump into you and start a conversation there is a point – I did when I was 22 or 20 – I was a dumb moron – I had no idea.  You all were using conversations to figure how to kill each other.  - But watch gun control in CA – the activists appear to want it to be bloody and messy as it will foment fundraising – even odd murder incidents on Christmas have to do with money. 

this is from last night – there is an illusionary quality to dining – especially when people start saying things like this food is better than that one – and I rubbed my inner left ear with left middle finger as I bean the line before this one -  there is a value for a restauranteur in differentiating his food and saying you have never had tomanles like that- and some of it – the phrase I'm thinking of is a bit colorful – and not really a good one – piss in the wind denotatively means pie in the sky – it is not that – but there is an element of overselling – of faux distinction in the food – and a restaurante gets more buisness this way – but their is value in not giving into that too much.  Rubbed right ear with right thumb and forefinger – top of right ear – realizing that there is not good reason to have a $10,000 martini.   Chefs are like archtiects – there are time when it saves a ton of money-   IF YOU IGNORE EVERY WORD THEY ARE SAYING -  honesty in cooking is as common I think as honesty in architecture – the chance of a blue moon.

by the way slightly lost control of bladder when going to bathroom  after going to bathroom here – a theme. 

Don't People Watch Maigc Tricks
custom taylored birthday cakes at midnight in new york city – despite colorful intros – um I'm sorry – I'd have to look – but you did adventure  and this isn't star trek the next generation- your series sped up over time to – like the first intro is quieter more thought provoking – the second is okay- it's a little faster – well like sorry – but one of the petpeeves is – why are children's attention spans going down – I don;t know that off of current data – but we worry about children not reading and yet one might – I would argue – as your show evolves its sped up too – so even the quiet show – sped up – it is there – I even got the same reaction off of the show I said I liked watching it's intro change in 1987-88 – it's done well – but it's faster and catchier- wasn;t there a moron in england who like did a kid's series of books with small pictures and quite a few pages when the wisdom was-  big picture and less pages? - there may be some wisdom in that in not doign exactly what the marketers would have you do – I did actually see a few episodes of your show in earlier and then later years – the new yorkization of sesame street does run parallel with what others did – and new york can be neat – I remember a little of the show – for a show focussed on reading – it has a science grant-  why so activity – there are many shows in that genre ? - showing snippets of scenes – cause like – one show in the past was much more in one location and slow – and honestly – for the title of this that is what I would expect – but it is not what it turned into – it's not terrible – but it is more experiencing reality in its later stages than sorting getting knowledge from books – like how does a book – not a book on – how can the book be sueful – it does hold that the show sort of suggests the actual experience is better – by the way it is produced – um the model goes to the place – doesn't use the book – the book ancillary – you did it that way-  versus the book setting the narration – big difference – and the actual experience in many cases is more valuable – HOWEVER – there are places where reading thought and the imagination do trump actual experience -  or at least – they have a strength and a power and that could be emphasized – it is downplayed – I just went here and it was a real nice time – oh and there's a book on it you could read if you want to – so why read the book if you can go there?    Some of the experiences are well done – I liked that – but it's nto really what one thought the purpose of the show was – starting out -  like if I ask later-  why don;t children like longer reading – they never get shown examples where reading may be a superior experience – that is hard to show on TV and it would focus the episode around a book – maybe different types of writing – different languages – different scientific charts – medical charts – reading – words are escaping – ruins of a structure of ancient time – but also – like using words to ponder a question – someone with his tennis shoes once in a while would do a segment like that- not often – but that wasn't his show in full -  taxonomy would be a neat thing to show – the chemicle formulas – why can't you show that- like a show on written word – or much of it – not always – reading movements of a person – not really a book – reading advertising – reading taxes  maybe trash – how can you read trash – what are dinosuar bones but trash – trash tells (y)ou something – reading music – maybe going into music comprehension  -basic musical understanding -  reading bar codes – how does that work – reading a tree – someone could od a kids show like that-  a certain show showed a lighting board and – acutally he had a sound board – showing in depth for like a several mintue segment  how different parts of music or theater lighting go up on boards and are translated into the actual event – comprehending through reading to produce an event – why was there never a show like that?  Children might not understand it – hmmm – no they might not- usually when learning something you don't fully get i the first time you see it- don't people watch magic tricks ?  Reading a skull – by the measurements – and showing how on the chart you can figure it out – how different features tell you different things-  reading instructions for putting together a bench or a table or a building – i reading dungeons and dragons layouts for different dungeons when I was 7 – it is not very disimilar to architectural blue prints – and you do not have to start with the most complex one – the newspaper plans in like the post gazette – that much detail of an ideal housing plan – could be a start tracing your way through a building using a map.  Or a city. 

Ride of the Polar Bear Valkyries coming Soon
we're only giving control of our nuclear arsenal to someone whose friend tried to blow up the pentagon – there's nothing crazy about that – is there? -  the cooling shows that global is happening.    - are you sure life isn't a fantasy role playing game in disguise as we fight with different video clips and dungeons and dragons and on the price is right – no fiction writer could write this stuff.   If weren't for the totalitarian regime ending the global economy and killing all civil rights thing – this would all be insanely funny for the sheer absurdiy of it-


You can use smallville on the wb, and I will respond with “into he fire from babylon 5 “am I wearing a ring – in my case I was born this way.  - it woiuld be nice if you'd let babylon 5 load 11:41 EST 12/25/08 – but we had to mess with commercials and theaudio and video feed synchronization. 

after writing on the snowman below – lost control of bladder slightly in bedroom when getting up to go to bathroom. 

North Korea – still a little too much -

boortz -I never remember not to paste email list – or I forget a lot – and paste the email list somewhere else in this case boortz and then delete it – slows me down which si the intent – like the mistypes 10:07 12/25/08

A Monstrous Illegal Snowman or a Fat Law-abiding One – which is the intent
Snowzilla – I do hope one distinguishes between real harm to one'sneighbors and perceived harm or the neighbor's just not liking a person – there is a difference physically taking snow off other people's property without their permission – versus attacking the person on the hill for being different  and I hope you aren't trying to do what you might – There are rules governing capitalism – you can't put the competing idea in a mental hospital would definitely be one of them – like if farmers could get rid of eli-whitney – like slaves could have killed off eli-whitney to keep farm labor high and to keep individual gun smiths necessary – all those jobs were lost because eli whitney invented things that destroyed the need for labor – they did create new industries and new jobs later- but yes the old jobs disappeared and on today's model people would get rid of the person who would make their job disappear and protect the status quo in order to have job security- so you should have killed off eli whitney by that definition as he cost many people their jobs – it is not the same thing  - IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING JUST THAT YOU DON'T SEE IT – YOU DO NOT EVER PROTECT A STATUS QUO EXCEPT IN A LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCE -  THE BEST IDEA GOVERNS SOCIETY – NOT THE IDEA THAT CAN BE FORCED ON OTHERS – THAT HISTORICALLY IS HOW IT HAS BEEN – AND YOU SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED OF A NEW IDEA – YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY FRIGHTENED IT MIGHT GET IMPLEMENTED AND COST YOU A JOB – THAT IS NOT HOW THINGS HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST – IN THE PAST THE BEST WON OUT AND GOT IMPLEMENTED – YOU CAN RETARD FOR A WHILE – BUT NOT FOREVER – AND  - forgetting what I want to say ho ho – if you didn't do that - - there  YOU ARE AFRAID YOU WILL LOSE THE ARGUMENT IF IT IS PRESENTED OPENLY – THE ARGUMENT FOR THE IDEAS – BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WAY WAS THE BEST WAY YOU WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR – BUT YOU KNOW YOUR WAY IS NOT THE BEST WHICH IS WHY THERE IS TREMENDOUS FEAR – things that could happen won't be seen – unintended consequences-  IN THE END THE BEST IDEA WINS OUT – ONLY WITH MANIPULATION AND TRYING TO JERRY RIG THINGS DOES THAT NOT HAPPEN AND THAT IS MORE A  20th and 21st century thing where people try to manipulate what gets into the public  versus letting the bes idea win out - - I am sorry – the first example I can think is 1917 isn;t it the Bolshevik Revoltuion – the oligarchs were so corrupt that it went like that and it was hard to correct for years – the anger pushed out an emotional response that wasn't a good solutioon – what someone appears trying to do now in 2008 – labor unions in the US were a poor response to bad management – It has happened before that – the monarchies – when the best idea does no win more blood seems to be spilled-  Napolean – rejecting the reforms – religious reformnation – the catholic hcurch was not terrible from its book – but I do not know the full sotry- but it got out of hand – I don't want to go all the way into that period and I don't know all of it – let's just say some of the cardinals sound like they would sell a senate seat at that time – and the bishops-  and they did – sir Thomas Moore – the people who prosecuted him – essentially got sold titles.  -  i AM SORRY I GET INTO THIS SO EASILY – TO ME WE ARE CLEARLY WATCHING IT HAPPEN  AGAIN RIGHT IN FRONT OF US-  WE HAVE TONS OF HISTORY TO DRAW ON TO TELL US WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT AND WHERE QUESTIONS EXIST-  AND YO USE IT HAPPENING – I'M NOT WATHCING IT ON A HISTORIC TELELVISION – I AM ALIVE – AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO – THEY WON'T CHANGE COURSE AND I GUESS I HAVE TO LET GO  - because something always follows – that play is there – we are mad about planes sliding in airports – honey bun you are going to be hearing god's pest control commercial as the pests – that is what happens with an overreaching – the snowman in AK – may be just saying – US people won't listen to laws- it is also saying – here is a person who is nuisance to his neighbors doing something on his property and the government has to step in and control – and I bet some people think that is analogous to my example – although there wasn't a city ordinance against – and the administration at the school had to abuse and break laws to get me into a mental institution – and that is a key difference  - THE NEIGHBORS DIDN'T LIKE ME – BUT I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG – THEY MADE IT HAPPEN – AND THAT IS WHERE A SACRED AGREEMENT AND CONTRACT WAS VIOLATED AND THAT IS THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE-  they talk about what might MIGHT have happened – you cannot throw a person in a jail for what you think they might do or because you think they are bad – only under severly limited circumstances and the reasons being given in my case – I am german and we may lose our jobs – and really we want our criminal traffic – those do not work – there is a line – and I did not cross it -you decided society has to work the way we want it to – and you can't do that-  they are provisions in the government agaisnt that – because if you can do that to me – I can do that to you – there are more of us – we will say how well that argument plays out – it has been defeated historically – the sophists of France gave the foil to that argument as the reason for a democracy – not to rule exactly in that fashion – we don;t like what you are doing so we'll stop you – you would have said the same about Eli  Whitney or the guy who made an electric refrigerator if you cut ice blocks from lakes for a refrigerator – and I guess this isn't so we will be having this discussion.   We didn't break the code with – neither my high school – nor Carnegie – mellon  who had the same instance in actually a more public setting used that against me – you never saw how much I sued(used) the electronci bulletin board of carnegie – mellon – precursor to email  - you have no case – your judgment is radically difference than others-  you broke rules to get it – rubbed left corner of left eye with left middle finger asa(as) I made corrections to the above 4 lines.   - the snowman is from AK – and there a presence up there that is relatively benign – but this story has that connotation of neighbors who had to get together to take care of someone who was out of control – you'll note the AK board told the neighbor he was out of control – versus lying to the individual and even in the psychaitric sesssion – oh Franz all medication is voluntary – oh you won't have to pay for it there is a sliding scale – we need you to keep goig – never – we hate your guts and don;t want you here and think you are adolph Hitler – NEVER ANY DIRECT WARNING – ALL BEHIND THE BACK – LIES AND TRICKIER – AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHICH DOES INCLUDE THE SCHOOL – YOU CANNOT GET AWAY WITH THAT-  THERE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM – IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY YOUR OBLIGATION TO TELL ME THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND TO LET ME KNOW WHAT YO UARE TRULY PROPOSING – INCLUDING CARTING AWAY VIA MENTAL HOSPITAL – KIND OF LIKE MOTHER SAYING SHE IS COOKING A SPINACH SALAD – WHEN SHE PLANS TO GIVE ME A REGUALR SALAD THAT SHE KNOWS I DECLINE WHEN SHE SAYS SALAD – BUT BECAUSE SHE SAID SPINACH AND i WOULD CONNOTATE THAT WITH BEING COOKED-  SHE KNEW I'D TAKE – SO SHE CALLED IT BY ANOTHER NAME TO GET ME TO TAKE IT WHEN I WOULDN'T IF SHE WERE UP FRONT – THAT IS WHAT YOU DID – AND YOU AREN'T REALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT.   -we mnade gestures and cleaning up Pittsburgh – yes but we come back to indirect gestures do not count – this is where we don't quite agree – yo ucan;t tell a person you don't like the way they do things and get them to change-  we disagree on that-  I beleive that if it is not in the law – then you have no right to tell a person how to behave – you do not think that  way – and you fudged on your side- well – you fudged and I won't allow it to go away – maybe the government won;t prosecute – in which case I won't be an american citizen if that is possible -  barack Obama will shut me up – we will see if that happens – that is your plan – it certainly isn't mine – Chicago needs a lot of correcting in my opinion just like Pittsburgh does on this matter.   You cannto control others that is a bedrock of the country and it is spelled out .   There were specific laws to prevent persecution by a larger group  - that is what the puritans fled and that is what they wanted to make sure never happened again .. 

if I did have my own residence – I would like it to probably say don't bother – Chicago and neighbors deciding they don't like the look of a neighbor's property – shall we say they do not wholly own the american flag – and they do not have the right to tell they are american and I am not – if they do – then I would like to leave this country- and vote a thumbs down on its future as a poor example to the world – it is not right to have neighbor's controlling the thoughts and practices of neighbors that is not the america I grew up in – right corner of mouth – rubbed with right index finger joint

As an added note the analogy of the apparent four story blaze of a gas fire that exploded a house in Sacramento beign compared with a bomb in Vietnam - that analogy when someone did explain it a little more on kfyo as I had asked- that was pretty thin - like a bomb- if you deal with explosives why do I bet you recognize explosion patterns and would not mistkae one ofr the other - the line "something like you might see in Vietnam" was placed in there to suggest a threat.  or the house the threat - but the vietnam line tied it to the usual cast of characters who have decided I cannot live in my current form - noted- next  today is 12/25/08

USE THE HAMSTER FOR ANTI-PSYHOTIC CHEMICLE SHISH KABOB
It is a nice thought that I could have been a famous architect – in many ways I am glad I am not – in honesty one good thing out of these years is there are a few other avenues open to me that i had not explored – in order to be a famous architect and live that life-  like you have to cater to clients who are scumbags – even if they let you design and your name is on the building-  like the market forces would have killed me if my heritage did not – and the market forces are part of why I left- now people did place me in optimum positions to be discouraged and that was intentional – in order to be what I am now-  I need to see more than one discipline – until the mental hospital I was ahead of othersin education for my age-  not all  -true – but I didn't not enjoy much of the time – if you will – I didn't like being in archtiecture and got out of it – they said it would the biggest mistake and they thought it was a victory – it turned into their defeat – I found something I never would have found had I stayed in that profession – it would be nice ot be financially more comfortable – maybe I might even want a family if things were different – I didn't lose everything – society undervalues a multitude of experience – instead of punching a time clock or filling out an hours sheet for time spent on projects – I had this life where I did get to spend a lot of time in a bedroom usually with a computer-  usually working on my own stuff – what is that worth – NOTHING – not really -  most computer science people who get good jobs-  give up the right to work on their stuff- or some of them do – that was very important to me not to do that- a master architect- I wanted to say this better- he still has to lick his client's butt  - andyou have a few clients – so you can't lose all of them – I mean I worked for a decent renokned architect in Pittsuburgh – the one who initiate my first trip to a therapist- but I coudl trell he wasn't happy as much as he said otherwise – you have the prestige – you have to them throw functions and be at functions – I hated just about function I ever went to – I don't have to go to them – this is great – but you're poor-  true – I am now – but in 2002 I wasn't as poor – I had enough – enough resources for me – I didn't much – i didn;t set it up to need much – I didn't know how it would all have worked out – but I felt I could work part time and try different jobs – find something in time – and until then – work on my book – initially I had a fianncial plan of mine to make it work – given lower expenses that I incurred – that was always the key – the way I lived – I did not have the high overhead of my peers – and I could afford a much lower paying job and be okay – even have money left over – and I knew how to do that – and people hated – well they hated something – maybe something else besides just calling me a richie – I was richie because I knew how to spend money-  well – and how to not spend it -  I USE TO NOT SPEND EVERY DIME – THINGS ARE DIFFERENT TEMPORARILY RIGHT NOW – THOUGH IT HAS BEEN A GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE TO DO THIS- DO A DIFFERENT PATTENR THAN I WOULD HAVE NATURLALY  -  got distracted for a minute thinking of glenn beck not having enough water back stage because a union employee “forgot” to bring enough – they would get revenge that way – even while you're paying them – and they see no problem with that-  but I wanted to say – not needing that professional income meant – I could do other things-  I wasn't pressured into taking a job requiring my college degree-  now I know our society teaches that upward mobility garbage – of like I am not making the most of myself-  I could that no architecture firm was gonna sue me well – quite frankly much of professionals in architecture I can speak – but from what I saw in medicine – it is the same-  you don'ty learn the profession until you do it – beign the apprentice and watching whether it is treating a patient – or seeing the design and or lying to the client the architect does – until you have to that – you don't learn it-  and the professional system pushes college grads into a waiting position called apprentice or in medical resident or there is another name for a not full doctor – it's not intern 2nd year resident doctor – not important – right thumb to side of right eye – but a doctor's residency is what i was serving – and it isn't really the right way to do it-  you aren't helping the person grow – my bosses didn't care and used me as a draftsperson – and many people just were treated like that for years – now some got treated a little different – it was kind of odd hwo that changed – but did not for others – it wasn't on deisgn  skill – in fact in my case having more design skill than my bosses was a liability-  it sounds arrogant – it is true – though hard to prove – first of all although no source is fully relaible – it was said in a place to me where it was not competitive by a peer – second you know – it depends on how objective you are with yourself – but if you can hadnel the problems put in front of you and your boss can' ahs more trouble – you're a beter designer – and when you come up with a solution and he will not use it just to spite you and it satisfied the parameters he laid out and it happened with more than one boss-  maybe – i think every one of them did at least once – where they'd give me something and I'd solve it and they wouldn't use it – on purpose in several cases because it made them uncomfortable to use and take it from me and put their stamp on it-  even though that how it works – I was the intern – I don't have a stamp – my teachers didn't give me much credit either- that bothers me a lot less now – professors I should say-  we are reopening old wounds-  that have been discussed – but yeah – no colors in third year – don't use bright colors on drawings-  ARRRGGGHHH -  and the games – I didn't even know all the games 2nd year – and there were games-  your circulation is loose- yeah – I hate this architects who like control every movement like Louhy Kahn does – I hate that- and then the best was – you can't have a path with pavers – you can't do it like that in the real world – I want you to do antoher way – and my parents took me to a place like that several months after the jury on that project – the first lesson of school architecture was – BELEIVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING YOUR ELDERS TELL YOU  - THEY ARE LYING THROUGH THEIR TEETH TO PROTECT THEIR OWN AGENDAS  - so like when you say climb the corporate to me – and that is best-  why – they suck at judging you and your ability anyway – I bet a real is jsut as egotistical as a professor – in fact I know that I – the world is circular and once in a while a telemarketer gets to call like the head of an architecture and ask him for a donation to WQED and it is a person who turned the caller down for a job earlier in his life as an architect and you find out this head of a firm who makes $100,000 or $200,000 a year or more-  cannot give more than $50 to public television – which doesn ot seem so much a crime now – but if you think it sucks say it – don't hide it – but we paly the game – of course it's wonderful I can afford $50  though – and I already gave it to someone else-  like I had no respect for head architects and now that I know more – I have much less – I think the people who believe in the career thing with too much sincerity and let their job rate them are the fools now-  and that's just it – to get to be a master architect – somewhere along the line – you had to kiss someone's ass- you got that first project – and you don't get that without a connection – you ahve to do something to compromise your credibility – you ahd to play politics somehow-  I never had to do that-  I didn;t make any money-  but when i didn't like something or felt it was wrong – I got to say it – that is worth something – you cna't fit into a larger organization – maybe not on a longer duraction  - no – I was never given a chance once i finished my degree.  - I never needed to for very long – there was DAM – but I now see that was a setup – and you can't say my way wouldn't work somewhere or somehow unless you make assumptions that didn't happen – and once you make one of those assumptiosn – you are outside of the boundaries of reality and are doing a hypothetical – itching left edge of top lip with right index finger joint side – I jumnped from here to here to here and that worked – I didn't say – most of the times there was a reason to jump – it's a bad sign when the landlord of the building after you've worked their six months goes to you and says – aren't you gone yet – and yes my second boss in Chicago – i think planned for a seasonal draftsperson and didn't mention that part of the deal.  He could've been like that – resting forehead on first two right hand index figners – but the architects didn't want to help me and no one else tried too hard – so I helped myself and I wound up beign in college for several years while my peers worked – and i sit in my bedroom all day and write mostly what I want -and even at DAM – when off work and I took it as a part time job-  I wrote what I wanted did what I wanted – it was a trade – but I got something for trading he career away – that I wanted – Pittsburgh said it was wrong – that is not how you do it – what the fuck do they know – their city is dying – in aprt because the career career isn't worth that much – not as much as they think  -you are better following wherever it is you want to land – and the first was the most painful – well these years haven't been a picnic- but in the end it would've worked if they didn't interfere – it failed because they interfered – and I note that – and I will not like cooperate – you can kill me – but I will force that at this point and it's on you as a nation that you do that to your young – it will say a lot about you – I'm going to blackmail you  - deal with it – whatever charge I get now will look really suspicious at this point – I've nailed your but to the wall – if I don;t give up you've got nowhere to go – and even if I do – it won't look too great-  Pittsburgh places a premium on competing – but in reality no one is competing – not directly like that – we all want something different out of life -and grabbing the brass ring isn't it for a lot of people and they won't look themselves in a mirror and admit society has fed them a load of bullshit and they should be trying to do something else.   I remember he workman I worked that one summer when I was 21 – and they all said – they said a couple things – I studied zen a little – or whatever I studied – eh said it was zen – Alan Watz – but sort of that fulfilment doesn;t come with position – and the plumber said to me one day – “you ain;t where you wanna want to be right now Franz”  - “how do you know Joe – I did deal with a Joe the plumber – but he isn't the 'Joe the plumber' – and his answer was “cause I know” - implying that sweeping the floor could not be the task of a self-fulfilled person – I never said it – but i was thinking – why not ? - it could be – many people in zen – they are not multi-millionaires – way of the peaceful warrior – a guy like that-  he is your gas station attendant – you have to be honest-  but one thing in tai-chi is like being comfortable in an uncomfortable position – learning that-  how aobut being fulfilled in what seems like an unfulfilled life – maybe not unfulfilled-  but with littel status – little position – what do you want? - Do you want the power and the pain that goes with it – most underlings don't get and I don't fully because I didn't deal with it much – but if you look you see it – everyone is at you if you get in power – even as an intern – meet the contractor and you're his boss – he has 20 years of experience or whatever and you have a college degree – and he is trying to bull or push you somehow and won;t do it hard – but enough it's uncomfortable and you learn if you pay attention – there is stress with any authority and that infighting crap wastes so much time and energy – but it's necessary to do anything – not to writing – not to exploring – not nearly as much is it needed – it's ahrd to get paid to do that- but I just realized I didn't want to be a regular career job – and getting back – the second thing about the workman – archtiecture will be great – yeah get your liscense thing to do – but guys it's not – it's not any better – I'm not much happier as an intern in a frim in Mt Lebanon than I was here – it's not what it is billed as  LIKE MARRIAGBE THERE IS AN INHERENT LIE -  people say one thing but another is true and they try to push you into maintaining the bullshit – because they want – whatever they want – children who grab the brass ring – it's status and the family cares – about itself – it is selfish – to the child – it wants the child to get itself into an uncomfortable job in order to satsify the families status – that seems to be the thing and woe be to the person who like me calls a spade a spade – and says – this isn't a good way to live – I make a little more – but I spend more because of how I work – I have to take a plane instead of a bus because I only have 3 days to get there – where as when I was freer – I could take the bus and spend less money to travel the same distance – and there were a lot of things like that with a profession  - where I made more – but I spent more to keep the job – maybe giving up the job makes sense-  and it did – but Pittsburgh didn't approve- I didn;t know it was their choice – and we won;t admit what went on there – how that was managed – you won't tell me flat out – what did and did not go down – I can guess a lot – knowing why woudl be nice – and I won't get that – I will be lucky to get an – we will leave you alone from now on – but we're not admitting we're wrong – you're a fudged up person and we're glad your not in our city -  IF YOU REALLY DIDN'T LIKE ME YO USHOULD HAVE JSUT SAID THAT  WITH THOSE WORDS – YES YO UFUCKING ASSHOLES-  YOU HAVE TO SPEAK ACTUAL WORDS – YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE INDIRECTLY IT DOES NOT MEAN THE SAME THING – SSAY WE WANT YOU OUT OF THIS CITY – I may not have left – but only a direct approach would have i listened to and possibly heeded on something like that-  I know to you – you told me plenty of times – but I don't look at it that way-  I don't communicate like that – and after the 2004 DAM discussions you should have known – but didn't care – I had to do it your well(way) – well where are where we are – you will not get out of this even if you get me -  you still dream that I bet – I don't pick up on what I see that you are getting out of this with just a slap on the wrist – not now – you never stopped – but you couldn't tell people that the reality of being a professional – did not match what you were told while you were getting a degree – the people you knew in school – to the best of my ability – we're going through the same thing of a massive let down out of school – it's not what was promised – and the professors were assholes on that – totally dishonest and telling us – stories of how our colleagues suceeded against the odds – but not like that most people weren't doing that – many hated their jobs – but that doesn't get a person to give the at that tiem $25,000 a year in tuition – you say it's lovely instead – forgot what I wanted to add – resting forehad on first two middle fingers – right hand – scratching scar tissue on left pinky with right middle finger – I wqaned(wanted) to say that – now I can't quite remember – soemthign about how Pitttsburgh wanted my experiment to fail – something like that – it knew it could succeed – but it didn't want it too so it decided to cross a line – the typin has slowed and someone is recording every keystroke again – people don;t want to admit they could change their won lives and at the income level I was at that could not be hidden from -  that's not what i wanted – they stripped something – I listened to what i thought I wanted to do and I am very glad of that of not going – but i'm going to lose my status and – oh wow – you assholes – the freaking federal unions and that brat i have to listen to on kfyo – Charlie – the charlie commercial – and the US department – preaching all that shit  to our kids and to parents and it is sh_t – total bull – and they say it to parents every day kfyo – Charlie gets student loans – she is a girl – though usually in Us at least in the north Charlie is a guy – but here Charlie is a gril – the cursor is slow – even at 2am someone or 7 minutes to – someone is recording every keystroke I make – why do I bet it is someone aligned with Pittsburgh who shouldn't be? - but Charlie tells us the story the Higher Education industry and the teachers and professors – and the loan agencies and banks want people colllege age and their families to hear – and they sold me on it at one point – Charlie in the ad does not have enough money for college and her parents can't really afford it – but mom knows about student loans and getting accepted to college was a real thrill for ccharlie – screw you slowing down my typing hop[ing to slow down myu thinking so yhou can moniore what I type – I will fght you and I can feal the pressure in my head – I will go fast so you can rip a thoguht out which is why you are slowing down the tpying to get an extra shot at stripping a thought out you don;t want on the page – I know that-  But Charlie is thrilled at getting accepted and she is grateful for the sutdnet aid which is the only way she can get into college or so the ad says that may not be true – and Charlie at the end says – I never realized what an accomplishment getting a degree was-  and the typing slowd again -
 ODDLY ENOUGH THE BANKS DON;T HAVE ME SPEAK -
GETTING THROUGH CMU SUCKED AND IT WASN'T WORTH THE TIME AND ENERGY PUT IN JUST TO GET A JOB IN ARCHITECTURE – THE OJB DIDN OT PAY FOR ALL THE MOENY PUT OUT TO GET THAT DEGREE AND THE PEOPLE IN HOC FOR LIKE $40,000 OR $50,000 – THEY MUST REALLY HURT – NOW IT'S NOW SO BAD TO PAY IT – IT IS DOABLE FROM EXPERIENCE  - BUT NO UNLIKE THE CHARLIE AD – IN THE FRANZ IT WAS NOT WORTH IT – IF YOU WERE EXPECTING A GOOD JOB YOU LIKE IT WASN'T WORTH IT – IT WAS NOT A THRILL FOR ME GETTING ACCEPTED-  I GOT REJECTED FROM MY TOP 5 SCHOOLS AND CMU WAS LIKE A DECENT BACKUP  THAT I WAS HOPING NOT TO USE INITIALLY BUT THE IVY LEAGUES HAD OTHER IDEAS – AND ALL DECIDED ON THE SAME DAY – THE REJECTION LETTERS CAME THE SAME DAY – THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME – IT DIDN;T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING GRADUATING – EITHER PITT OR CMU – OR CCAC – GRADUATION WAS NOTHING – FOOD AND PEOPLE AWKWARDLY GREETING EACH OTHER – BUT NO FEELING OF GREAT EUPHORIA IN HONESTY AFTER CMU THAT DAY I WAS LIKE THIS IS IT? - I AM NOT REALLY READY TO GO OUT IN THE REAL WORLD – I DON'T MUCH MORE THAN WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL  AND COLLEGE DOESN'T TEACH YOU THAT MUCH ABOUT LIKE – AND LOOKING BACK NO IT WAS NOT WORTH $125,000 TO GO TO CMU FOR THAT DEGREE – THERE WERE BETTER WAYS TO GET AN EDUCATION – I GOT SOMETHING FOR IT – IT WAS NOT GOOD VALUE SPENDING -  I would personally – typing is back to normal – nice – I totally disagree with what the Charlie ad of I think the wondrous department of education and the ad council wnat students to think – students are honrswaggled into thinking education will be this great experience that will give them everything they need – it doesn;t really work like that – and the worst thing I watch over and over – is over – hyped expectations leading young people to blow tons of money they don;t have in school on a degree they don't really know they want – and then they get out – they hate the professioanl jobs they feel they have ot take to pay off their loan and their miserable humkan beings who want to vote for Barack Obama and blame everyone else for a bad life-  and the ad council and the US department of education in cooperation with the banks who like the business – ENCOURAGE COMPELTELY THE WRONG IDEA OF EDUCATION  -THAT GETS SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN TROUBLE -  - and my life was a foil to that and a different way to do it and I compared CCAC and Cmu and found the price of CMU wanting – for the “difference” it provided – I ahvew gone into before-  it does you something – if it were my money-  my kid would not be going to CMU – not at current prices – develop self-worth without all the pretension -  AND ALL THE FOREIGN HANGING AROUND YOU AS WELL -  but yes I wanted to say that- my life sort of proves the whole educational model wrong – they do not want the message out – that the goal isn't worth it – and I was an example of that – and it is paramount to get the young people to loan themselves into the next eon – with debt – because the bansk like that- so they wanted me dead or out of the way to  - can;t happily explore and say the rat race makes no sense – and here's naother way to do it – the banks and CMU and Pitt and even CCAC depend on me being wrong-  so  I had to be wrong – EVEN IF I WAS RIGHT AND THEY WERE JERKS FOR THEY DID TO ME -  CCAC should benefit – but the teachers are tied in with the system and dependent on higher univerisites and they play the game and hamsters were not allowed in the game according to them – fry the hamsters – FRY EM FRY EM  USE THE HAMSTER FOR (ANTI-)PSYCHOTIC CHEMICLE SHISH – KABOB  - we need our education jobs which are maintained by pushing tons of debt onto our children – it's a good system and they end up with jobs they hate too.  



00:12 12/25/08 – issues with the CBN player for radio causing me to have to restart the browser – occurred at coincidental time – someone had been in my head plying with me and that wasn't fully effective so they decided to attack the compuer to distract me from doing certain things  that aren't perhaps all listen  on a Christian radio station – when I started listening I was just fighting to stay awake however I could and someone made a sugestion later on which was a good idea and people nasty  when they are getting defeated and nothing is sacred.  If it can be interrupted they go after it.  Resting forehead on first right hand finger joints – touched thumbs -

when you strip away the mental skin of some who put up a false facade and you see who they are and they realize that you do  - they look very different and not so strong – heating saruman as he sounded when angry – not being enspelled-  right now I might be able to relate to hansel and grettle very well. 

23:20 EST the break occurred – the lights got dimmer in the room – or seemed to – but I could read without interference – it was a break – it felt a little odd – not a snap – but more like a thud for 3 seconds in my mind – not the single snap it usually is.  It was there.  Rubbed behind neck with right middle finger as I wrote that.  - another took their place  - 23:30 Est – pretty quickly – another snap 23: 45 EST – the single snore was a nice touch 23:48 EST

I get the idea abou once a pardon is given it may not be revokeable – and someone is comparing that to another event in the Senate and the new administration  - yes – sorry I was slow on the uptake - - if you could unpardon someone – you would hold their fate in your hands for the rest of their life.  And yes he could revoke any pardon you gave me – I don't really seek a pardon do I – legally how to rememdy my situation is beyond me – one for lack of legal understanding – but two for lack of full information about what has been arragned agaisnt me – and also that it seems to have an understanding of its own beyond legaility.   - I am sweating from the effort to keep awake and fight mother but I am still up -23:11 Est

I've ahd this pressure in my head for last hour or so – she is determined to push me into sleep earlier than now 23:02 EST  12/24/08

does confronting people in jesus costume in a starbucks and at other places – that would help people feel chritians are fanatics and radicals and force thier religion on others – it's not a good practice – you are having fun with your religion as stated on kfyo at others expense – to a non-religious – that will be offensive in a way it is like that atheist sign in WA state – that is posted – like wearing that around your neck – think of it like that-  you are confronting ohters in a traditionally non-religious space with a non-asked for image – be very careful about that – and not just Catholicism is good – but an contentioous- word I want is not in my head- controversial – an uncomfortable image.  I don't think that si the best to convert or talk to people abou jesus – saying it is about a person with thorns in their head – that really isn't what it is about – not that image – focussing on that misses several points – forgiveness and other values of the chruch are not in that image when it is placed out of context.

by the wqay new tongue blister – left side close but not on tip on edge borttom – they only hit – if I don;t talk to mother for most of the day they don't hit-  like I notice if I wait to talk to her all day until the afternoon – then the blister will hit in the afternoon – that is why she constantly has some question to ask me – to get to speak – she was in prime form for christmas dinner -  mother told me I must have a vitamin deficiency to get tongue blisters – not eating her salads – grrrrr

on mark levin they are messing with the data nippets – snipping the sounds streams as data pieces and causing them to go into my computer in the wrong order- the phrases of the caller come in – out of order -

--
Levin – the old show isn't completely filled with circuitous callers – and the difference is notable – rubbed left temple with left middle finger – this is a sow(show) from a while ago – before they instituted heavr circuitous calling with these people who never make a point – and I could tell the difference – before I knew teh show was a repeat – and I knew by the caller reference which dated the show – you weren't on yesterday during your show Mark so you couldn't have said anythign about John Leibowitz – but that comment is how I got keyed in  - that it was best of – and the difference from the alst week is notable – when the circuitous calling on every call started – Mark i want to tell you my life history as a first time caller – merry xmas – how are you – and I'm a little nervous and i told your screener – and now wnat to drop a few words and give my family at the same tiem and talk about your dog who died – and then maybe I'll mae a point – 12/24/08

Mary – talking about John Leibiwitz – last night – so this is a best of show – Mark didn't mention that – german was terminated as a language from the middle school

Lane san francisco 1967 – blood and urine – wing-tips – I may not have known that-  drill here  drill now theme depart – drill for giving gov't revenue – obfuscating call – he said he doesn't want the theme to depart to someone – like it can be used to play with both conservatives and liberals – fundraising for liberals and stokes conservative base- he may be saying to others-  get so and so to drive home thaqt theme who is in congress - 

Eric – president's take us to war – didn't hear all of him – perhaps not super important- 

James – drug testing lab supervisor of the equipment – interesting caller

21:00 Est – mark did you take a cat-o-nine tails to the callers or is this just part of the game? - not as circuitous  – part of the game. 

as a former cartoonist – george schultz  was a sellout – his cartoon's reinforce traditional stereotypes  don't challenge the audience  - and he sold out to met life and I never forgave that – I know in Pittsburgh they never let hsi cartoons off the front page – they replay the old ones-  versus getting current cartoonists an attempt to comment on modern life – and he doesn't – he passes the deep stuff – so do most cartoonists -  they try not to provoke too mcuh – like the major syndicates – king features – universal press – they suck – they are liberal hot beds who kill a lot of creativity – and yes they all rejected me 3 times  20:56 EST 12/24/08


it will not make sense for Chinese to compare(repair) plasma tv's and ship them here – Jacob liked the last caller-  is he like the last caller's sponsor – it sound like it – love how “random” the people are that call in – rubbing right nsoe edge with right index knuckle -

new error – force quite fire fox – audio stream kept playing – but in time it shut down – could not use other windows – but almost-  like had control for a second after and it seemed like someone attacked a second – because the sound cut off of the audio stream with a snap – had to reboot firefox and it did generate a bug report – right before mailing senator durbin – 20:28 EST 12/24/08

the plague – the book we read that senior year too – albere camut – people at peak in a plague- who want a depression – cause misery  – or depression.  I will be the guy counting peas – 20:12 EST 12/24/08

a littel chocolate-  and white chocolate – ho ho – and fudge the other day-  they figure they cannot get to my teeth because I ahve been eating no sweets so they are trying to get me to eat a little of them – mother said spinach salad – asked me if I wanted it – said yes- thought it was spinach – it was – cold with tomatoes and peppers – a regular salad- she just didn't call it that – and she puts apple juice with sugar in it – in her salad dressing – helps cavities – I stopped taking it and don't take sweets – don;t have – had 1 cavity in my life and now don;t go to dentist – don;t have a little sugar-  the little sugar pwoers the bacteria-  eat a ton of it once or not at all – the little bit keeps the bacteria healthy – she is trying to get me to be in holiday and have a little bit of sugar keep teeth coated – as is our wonderful neighbor who gave the fuges -

zimmerman – west texas architect that did astrodome ? - other things lieutenant in army by 37 had liscense – died at 95 – I get your point pratt – they took what I could be – and I see the last name-  it is – and I wouldn't want that life- but I get I should have had a shot at it and was not given it. 

father did meals on wheels

so LONELY – yo have no idea who I am – you wish I was someone else-  - tell your story to pratt not to me 

in sacramento – a neighborhor's house exploded and cause other people to have to go to shelters

your caller is dirty – handicapped boy – got stand  - passedaway next day.  - 19:39 EST 12/24/08

tax holiday – as good an idea as sarah Palin for VP – which happened – yes to that- no to Obama day as a federal holiday. 

Mishandling cremated bodies-  do you want me to talk about my professor who was an undertaker and a cop at CCAC  - Cyril Wecht the Pittsburgh city coroner who was known to sell body parts – or like anything could be done with my body as I want cremation - - a lot of undertaker references – what  could be in a body-  well drug smuggler use them -

it is interesting that maddocks could have prevented the innocence project – or caused them to lose their funding through funds in his PONSI scheme. 

scam lawyer -hmm – didn't hear whole story

I never thought Santa Claus was a good idea – misleadsing people – bah on NORAD doing it – it's not good to lie-  it is not good to create a land of strawberry for children like that- it hurts them long term – like they swipe at real people who get in the way of their “perfect” world and will swip to kill them – as is happening – because of things like the holidays – because it becomes so important that the expectations hit reality when they can't – and the expectations aren't that great anyhway – because they are based on falsehoods – no gift should be that important – and yet we teach that it is – may Santa Cluas skip my house.   Jesus can come in though. 

I used to like drive – ins – could you bring a blanket and umbrella and whatever – in the summer – it sounds like where you are but – but use the drive in that way and not bring a car if you don't drive very much – drive ins died in CT – many closed.  Wonder if they could be regenerated with the idea that one need not use the concession stand.    - again I deduced santa didn't exist at age 4 – mother told me an easter basket wasn't how did she know ?– eliminateing NORAD's “work” in tracking him.  - never will forget in 5th grade being told that in 1st grade I didn;t write a letter to santa because I didn't beleive in him when the class wrote letters and got in trouble for that. 

Adam Sandler is not a favorite of mine – he is pretty wealthy at this point – ho ho

I apologize in advance - but the congressional screener I believe asked me what 10 minus 17 is - perhaps it was 7 and I just misread the numbers - but of course 10 minus 17 - that should be -7 not 7 - perhaps I read it wrong - my -7  answer was incorrect-  I do make arithmetic errors - - now you're asking math problems- it's just simple addition what could go wrong?- - whatever congressman (or whomever) thought this up - perhaps needs to work the IRS customer service desk for a little while - during march and april  

Sacramento CA – had the explosion below – one man said it reminded him of his tour of duty in Vietnam – ho ho ho ho – could he elaborate on how - - odd off the cuff reference-  19:00 Est 12/24/08 – that was a threat – the story was – kfyo

emotional personal times – so you are afraid of your emotions? 18:52 EST  12/24/08

the dumb employee who left the doors open for the 4 year old in lubbock - yo udidn't want me to develop wither - I had resources and it happened and Pittsburgh messed up - but they are trying to kill me-  that's not allowed- they didn't shpherd and I escaped - but I wasn't supposed to develop - like you didn't want it either- yo uwanted me the way they did - it's just you don't approve of killing me when it screws up - that's not a good way to resolve it - you do pick who develops or try to.  I wish you let me in on what was happening and why and you won't

loud music – confrontation lubbock – like yes where i was that happened several times and it is a way to set up meetings -
with me there was the neighbor who lived below who offered me marijuana later arfter a couple weeks and then left – but I met him at 4 am trying to tell him to turn the music so I could sleep – the party never stopped – he was phd computer science professor at CMU who oddly moved into the apartment below mine for 5 months

There was a period where there were loud noises um – loud music from neighbors and I had to go across the street and bang on their door 12am and tell them could you lower it a little -

Odd Events in Apartmetns - 
Even the Chinese in 1997-1998 – they were not fully honest either – the lock incident – being locked out of the building happened with them – and they set that up – landlord changed locks at their request

it was a test during the 2006 year when I was drugged did not feel like seeing anyone – I would not go out – at all and there was a car alarm – no not a car alarm – but the horn was being honked forever – continuous duration and yes after being thrown in the mental hospital on Dec23 rd  2005 – this was in the 2006 year – someone just kept honking their horn I let it go – the dark marine who lived below in 2006 eventually got it – itched right side of nose with right index finger-  in the year before I might have gotten their first – but I wasn't feeling too great-  before the dark marine and after the CMU PHD professor – there was an army ROTC from Pitt – - no the army ROTC could have been before the CMU – CMU may have been just before dark marine who moved in fall of 2005 – I think the Cmu professor was summer of 2005 – making the army ROTC pitt – 2004 and 2003 – and then before was the guy who burned the couch and filled the apartment with smoke – but the army ROTC guy – had some interesting issues-  the glass in the window of the front door was shattered – I did not go down – and he kind of questioned me about that next morning – the trash cans which I had to empty – I did it anyway and landlord sort of wanted me to do it – no firm agreement on paper – odd how my landlord in the end wants me or is okay with me doing more than my mother is – but anyway – no I don't want to take the trash out outside the house-  but there are plenty of things INSIDE the ask I do want to do and it is always too much trouble to let me control things – rubbing little left figner with right thumb – but he would fill the bags with everything – urine – the trash bags – and made my life a problem – when the landlord replace the door with a much smaller glass aperture where you couldn't tell who was behind the door – the frame was shattered within a week – I was involved in an odd display by me in 2006 with that – but after – it had already been broken by someone else and I got oddly upset because the door seemed locked – oh wow – yeah and in CMU – I lived inteh same apartment – and in CMU one night in the winter – it was cold 4am – I used to get home to the apartment at like 4am after being in studio all night – and sleep and go to class at 8:30 – or the class was at 8:30 EST – there was an instance where the locks were changed at one of the chinese graduate students requests and I had no idea – and I did not get a key – and I found out the locks were changed at 4am when my key didn't fit the door and I had to pound and pound to get in – and because of that experience when it happened again in 2006 that my key wouldn't open the new door I assumed the locks had gotten changed again – and no one answered – and I eventually tried breaking down the door to get into my building – to discover – this door had two locks – and although commonly we were using one of the locks – someone had decided to lock the other lock and I didn't check – didn't need to before – and yes looking at now – I see the set up – why wasn't someone home- they are busy – they don't keep super regular scheudles – odd thing one – odd thing two – second lock locked – I knew the setup at the time-  I got it – but I still blamed myself – but the frame had already been crack – I could see the and I jsut did more damage-  but point was it was a big deal to not be able to see who was in my apartment foyer from the door-  someone didn't like it that that got changed - - there was this guy who would – the burning couch guy – actually – no the army ROTC guy was a partier too – and his girlfriends like in the party came up to my room and would bang on the door to try to wake me up and get me to come out – and he let them upstairs and I wouldn't come out – just a stupid trick – now that I know the score – no – I thought he was just preparing me – someone else seemed to do that – antoher aparmtnet 2001 – mny Darien friend – was he friend or foe – he kept appearing like in a year 2002 and then in 2005 he popped up again – like a bad penny – I was supposed to move from Oakland when he did that in 2001 – and I didn't and that's why he kept popping up in oakland in 2001 and 2002 – like I would past all the time after I moved out of that building and actually into my famous oakland apartment so when the writing pitt professor mentioned that most people who have sometyhing stolen out of their apartment leave the area- he was in on the plan – that was no accident-  he said a lot of weird things-  and he worked at WDUQ besides being a professor at Pitt-  but back to the apartment – the army ROTC pitt guy – he had furniture on patio – brought it out on the porch which was a concrete ceiling of a basement floor with a metal railing – guys would sit on the furniture and sleep – and like i would walk out fo the building and people would be sleeping on the reclining chair or soft and sofa – people not in the building and it was a test whether I would wake them up and tell them to leave as I went out for a morning run and they would be there-  there weren't his friends they would just be there -  they were always gaming how afraid i was – how much I would challenge people – etc – they used that – guessed what you would do – or tried to intimidate you – I had little idea what was going until 2005 or 2006 – by 2006 I knew much of it didn't happen by accident – looking back – none of it did.

fair is an accurate description of the forecast where I am – not what is there 17:14 EST 12/24/08

It is very nice that certain people would consider inviting meeting(me) I caanot(cannot) leave here I bet even for a few hours travel for a social event on the tenth day of January unless someone else allows me to leave – I have to decline and that only changes if someone else okays otherwise – I definitely won't have the money to travel their(there) free it appears at this time.  I also do have other matters to attend to that may not conclude till(by) Jan 10th. 

always pushing the envelope in spending past my comfort zone – it does make sense – it does set things up right – if they want to hurt me they have to let me have what I want.

Snowzilla bigger n better – I guess whatever you do – do not tell an american not to stick his or finger in a light as an agent of the government enforcing government will or you will end up with an electrified or electrocuted american.  - it is a good response to my gothic horror movie comment

when turning off cbn radio – had to force quite – the window popped up and closed a window in the internet should not trigger that-  THAT is more likely a gremlin and a regular error – volume was up high enough I could hear and it there was no sound and apparently the cbn radio was in the background and I didn't know it – 15:58 eSt 12/24/08 – it signalled someone when I started using the computer again. 

I had the codex on the lawful(chaotic) evil fiends – I needed to get the one on the Lawful evil fiends – who have a code – but don't mind hurting others – you wanted to buy that book a week ago or so – aren't you glad I did today – I did precisely what you wanted – just with a different context.  Left thumb across left chin  side – like a flick of it as I wrote that. 

I did buy on a cost basis shipping to home – if you add taxes and shipping and your competitor does not – you tend to lose on a price basis – sorry – um but there are other things you sell I could use and I will look at them

I do minimize the improtance that a Caroline Kennedy deal got done – it is significant it got done – but it does go along with everything else and the more signficiatn event is pulling off that election – to some degree Kennedy is an I told you so – though yes – blatant political patronage like that is disturbing – my exasperation is spent over the election and watching all these people gaga for this person who is going to like starve them all to death and intends to – and everyone is like – yeah – yeah – yeah – she is just part of the crowd to me – I mean Schumer made a bank fail – another small and itneresting detail of old.    The world domination thing is sort of attracting my attention.

I might have more foregiveness for breaking the constitution and letting Senator Clinton be Secretary of State with the backtrack – lowering the alary move in Congress – but Obama wants her in there just to control Congress better anyway and get in apparently someone else-  like that isn't worth helping along in the first place and in the second – no – you're not really supposed to do that-  if it's DUMB – ammend it  it's not fully dumb though – the worry wasn't completely stupid about trading pay raise as a favor – it will be interesting to see how it all gets resolved – we're a little off the constitution with the secretary of state – a little off in natural born and complete US citizen – little off (here) and a little off there – here we're off there we're off – everywhere a little off – Old Obama had ACORN E I E I O

yes the citizenship thing is a really not great reason to deny someone an election – HOWEVER – Arnold Swartzenegger can't run for the same reason  - if it's a dumb rule for a natural citizen – then amend it – don't bend it – but we bent it – it appears – or why does the Gov of HI seal birth certificates – yeah i believe in the constitution – I jsut break wherever needed – whenever I want to. 

The World and the USA :The Gothic Horror Movie
and things fixed themselves quietly with the banks – or that is how it appears it's going to be – I don't not know – certainly chase before has sent me a letter the next month out saying – well we forgot to charge you so – we're going to charge you now and they can pull that – but is this the way it's going to be – NOTHING is said – I didn't happen – but some day I will wake up and this all be a fable – or things will completely change – no one will admit anything – like the banks no one is admitting wrongdoing – it seems that my grievance – my major ones appear fixed – though time will tell..   But that is how this will work – publicly it is as if – things are fine – like the cuban missle crisis – privately newt gets to put a gun to backy's head politically and say – read this and do this or else – I can't imagine that is correct – I still don't know the political resolution of this – spanish inquisition – that ahs been discussed – like everyone else – i have to wait to see how you do it – it does matter how it is done – and I am uncertain how much you will cover it and how deeply you will alter things – if you don't cover up – it is clear certain institutional and commercial based organizations will scream bloody murder this never happened and they will try to demonize me – and the public will support them – if you don't correct – it's like the “enemy of the people” - the water is really poison and we'll be drinking it – and you seem to have a code – a set of “guidelines – like you are all watching – the foreign groups – some of whom are now participants it appears – but I think both clinton and bush and mccain and palin and biden – you are just reading from a script and watching the public – with like a checklist in hand – it feels like that and it is weird to be sitting here knowing what I know – even the public who pays attention has to know – the birth certificate – the printing of money – they have to know – even without the other stuff – I know many of them are ignorant – BUT IF THEY DID NOT WNAT TO BE IGNORANT IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE – in some cases there is peer pressure and things – but others must know it is like a bad sitcom – very bad sitcom- in honesty it's like watching this all in slow motion thinking - “this isn't really happening” - “ they're not going to do this” - it is kind of like a horror movie in slow motion – or in a part – you know if the victim of the film opens a door something – the vampire is right behind it – and she opens the door slowly and you have time to go – NO NO NO – don't do it – you get killed- but she opens it anyway and the inevitable happens – that is what this feels – like – it's very bizarre – because it's real life and I feel like I am on television – no watching television – the people are determined to act the way they plan to – and even though you could talk to them – they won't listen to you – and I am starting to get – it is world wide – it's not just here -I am sorry – it is hard to comprehend that-  I cannot see where I am not – and in most cases have not been – rubbing right under nose – with right index knuckle.  I will stay with the rest of the audience – but I guess more eager and anxious than other audience members – waiting to see how this situation is resolved.  

I guess at time faith provides funding for those who change their websites – and I will respect that.  I get the feeling if you don't want anything – the fruit juice Senator lady doesn't really need it either – as she is not asking that hard.  Okay. 

Another charity off my list – UI used to like the idea of giving money to a charity that taught women health care skills in Pakistan – it had a huge write up in a Sunday paper a while back – 3 years ago ro more – mother mentioned it – I did my series on how it looks like that Harvard guy in Africa is fomenting unrest by helping with the medical care of people in countries – but not taking care of the economy – this charity in Pakistan is educating people on healthcare and founded by a silicon valley physicist or he is on the board – guess they get scratched from my list too – I think I know who I could give another donation too currently – not feeding the poor today- if things stand as they are – the poor will be in much worse straights if things are not corrected – I also may contribute to walmart – odd to put it that way – seems selfish – in other years it would be – funding may be given in the spirit of a conribution – because of different things – I could buy certain things on amazon – I need nothing more than what I have – some things I wanted now cost $30 – why pay so much – I think I will wait – if I don't get them I will live – I have enough – many thoughts in my

chase also did not charge me an overlimit fee – it looks like BAC on the smaller card $1000 – the payments for the last 3 months are smaller than the previous 3 – is this all part of that bank ruling thing that was on the news – there were restrictions and one was a problem I mentioned before – like banks not paying bills off in order, but biggest first  – which was a problem on my checking – not as much on my credit – that ruling  seemed to apply to just credit though – the news did not get into other provisions though – am I getting a check from chase and BAC later?  - and this is how it happens nothing is publicly said – over night numbers move and it is as if nothing happened – gotta love how it all works. 

btw - oddly enough - the check for the money I think I paid BAc but is no longer showing up on the statements  - is not yet forthcoming - and my typing slowed - someone is tracking what I am writing - my fingers didn't slow - the speed the words appeared on the screen slowed.  12/23/08 23:45(11:45) EST

Banking issues – um I can't prove anything – but things aren't the way I remember them -  I remember for several months – maxing out every credit – every one – which means in the case of BAC and chase that I get over limit fee applied every month – BAC is no longer showing that – and I looked a little at the balance sheets – monthly statements – they appear to add up – in reality I would have to go back and apply my federal checks – and then apply all known charges and see if my numbers matched the banks number and manually verify every single charge to catch this – BAC says I ahd no fiannces charge – not no finance charge – wrong term  very important – no over limit fee – I believe I had an overlimit fee every month for the last 6 months – on BAC – I remember paying the bills that way – BAC is showing no over limit fee for Oct 2008 on my $2800 card – and it is showing no over limit fees – for December statement – Dec 15th end – November statement – and October -   I started checking in september – they show low payments as well – like the payments are not high enough to pay an overlimit fee -  but that is just not what I remember – I cannot say more-  but the statements seem wrong – it seems like I didn't know what I was talking about when I asked for overlimit fees back to the caller – when I called the rep and asked back for overlimit fees on my student account last month – the records are showing there were none applied – so the rep didn't give any back – that is not what I remember paying – I don't think there were any payments to that card smaller than $40 – yet it is showing payments of $25 and $35  and no way – that just not right – but the statement appears to add up – mother is flying around the house-  I looked crazy – because they're appeared to be no overdrafts on that card – yet like the other $2800 card – I drew – the text came up slowly on the screen – someone is recording what I write -  I drew both cards out to the maximum at the start of the month as far as I remember close to the start of the month – spend the card balance down to the limit every month – after I was done spending cash – yet only the $2800 shows overlimitfees – and even october on that card shows no fee – that is not what I remember – this does bother me – you are not putting me in the posisition to do the needed detective work to catch this-  I do not have printed statements-  which I swear to god with be different from the digital records-  which I swear our different than I remember and did show a late fee every month – this is the first time on the student account today 12/24/08 – as I make a payment to BAC – that I don't see an overlimit fee – but every other time for the last 6 months approximately I remember that – it could be longer-  I only printed out in 2007 – it looks like they altered the records digitally  -  Ican't prove that – without – mega accounting – on my own – if you have my back on this one – it's going to be REALLY hard for me to refute what they are saying -that they didn't charge that many late fees – and honestly – it looks like money evaporated - - the payments are less – the fees aren't there – and the balances add up - - how do I prove bullshit – without manual tracking of all expenses for several months-  and I don;t know for certain I am right – but I want to say looking at this now-  IT LOOKS WRONG AND IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED – I THOUGHT THEY CHARGED ME A LATE FEE EVERY MONTH ON BOTH CREDIT CARDS FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND NOW THAT ISN'T TRUE ACCORDING TO THEIR RECORDS – AND I HAVE NO RECORD WITH WHICH TO REFUTE THAT -  

I was also going to add that the minimum are excessive – like if you owe $15 interest why not just get chraged that as a mandatory- some banks -GE and HSBC the minimum is higher than the interest on the account - - actually that is the other model – BAC and Chase do not require a minimum payment higher than the interest-  the min payment on chase gets you back to a level of credit on the card where you should have just enough to make the interest payment – it is a finances charge – and one could ask – why their fiannce charge is $15 a month or so on a $500 card – when HSBC – is charging it looks like $5 a month on interest on a $500 card – HSBC requires I give them $20 about – and get the card in  $15 – put $15 of credit back on the card – that I can then use - - with chase – I have to looks – but like BAC the finance charges for the smaller card are $11  - $1000 balance  - chase it seems it the finance charge is $18 – for $500 – I need to research that – just a quick look – need to see that- the top message is more important – my point was going to be here – to you it's not much – but like if I were living on my $733 federal check – like if it is only $5 interest a month – which may be high interest – but there si a difference between have to just pay the interest per month and having to make a payment that is larger – and I am  pointing out banks require a larger payment than just the interest charge – you have to pay into the credit priniciple every month – so I don't get the same deal the federal government does with other nations where it doesn't have to pay principle it just pays the interest – and liek with 6 cards – only paying about $5 per $500 worth of credit – balance -  like I have $1600- 3800 = $5400 in credit card debt – I never pay off – I could work at paying it off – I am not supposed to – let's not get into why – god said no – and I got a ray of sunlight to assure me if BAC did alter records – they got it -  but with $5400 of credit it would be really nice to pay $54 a month of interest – instead $158  is about what I pay in monthly minimums – estimating a bit – true is about $15 and $15 and $20 for three of the cards – that is from the statements  - with chase and BAC I had a late fee every month which increases minimum payment – and I won't use the accurate numbers -as I want to do it as if no overlimit fee were assessed -   $18 for chase and $15 and $70 for the BAC cards  $70 of interest on $2800 a month – for that card and $15 on $1000 – yes if you look you go hmm- because 2.5 *15 is $45 not $70  - it's a finance charge and not interest - - but the above needed interest payments-  to someone who has little – psuhing them to push a little money onto the card versus – keeping it alltogether as cash – that is not helpful and you have to abide buy the rules of the credit – all of which are different -where and how it can be used – which companies accept the card – that becomes an issue – the cash balance instance higher minimum payments would be nice-  and it primes someone like me if in need of moeny to max out the cards again and use each card little big – cause I have to cannot just pay the interest.  Noticing that today-  but the top is still more importnant – you didn't want me it appears to trace my stocks -I hope you got this one – cause I notice it – I can't prove it – not unless I can turn up what I need to – and if they erased the bigger fee and bigger payment and it'sw bank internal – the check balances – the income appears correct – but the fees paid look less than they should – and the fees charged  - the overlimit fees seem omitted.  - ugghhhh – is all I can say   - chase may not pulled this – I have to check them.  This is BAC 12/24/08 11:37 EST

Things You don't Necessarily Expect in a Fantasy Setting
yes and Gamma World Setting of Settle – the book I picked up complete with victory island or victoria island perhaps – and pungent sound or it is putrid sound in the book – someone is saying a little – and one of the adventures in the book they are trying to reassemble a nuclear weapon for the time of ancients.  - someone I guess wanted the “potential irony” of the plot line mentioned – I don't know – I know spelljammer went went off in direct references to the real world as this segment of Gamma world does although other pieces I have do not so much blame x or y and make a direct statement against a person – you do walk the line of – if you get really ardent politically and make it too cute – it's not a fantasy game or you lose the “suspension of disbelief” a little to do that – Ur-Draxa is pretty powerful as an idea without going after one place or group of people or person.   There is a tad of irony in here – and it is not super direct although – you even went there – in something i'm not going to mention – there is a Mike Soft in Redmond in the Settle Area.    - Paranoia works well for like real world references – directly – and this was published in 2000.  - there could pride in Isabel Ayende's statement – you can tell the deepest truths through the lies of fiction – however as a point – the story analogy doesn't fit as perfectly – perhaps it was not meant and it was only an indirect reference that that a group – alright – their adventure story is about knights of genetic purity – who want to kill all mutants – it's a secret society in the game and their plot is to clense the land of mutants I believe by setting off a nuclear bomb they find in the wreckage of Settle – in a map that oddly enough like WA state.    Mike soft is not the villian in the plotline – but yes – shall we say a “series of odd coincidences” in the writing and in truth it is on the line but not over on putting political commentary into a fantasy game – I rmember G' eneva the name of a planet in a Spelljammer module – that was unecessary political commentary-  invent like a paranoia thing for doing that – it fits better.   There are other things – you can say a lot without direct name referencing where it gets cheesy.   It's one ofthew modules SJA 3 I think the galactic vampire in Greatspace.  - and I want to note kids – there is a cost to an “honorable mention” in my letters – like the other side – my dear little “firends” who take an obsessive compulsive interest in every character I write – actually in my case every character I think – they have now this as I write and will add your name to the – scrub from face of planet list-  now looking at the amazon prices – they have already decided to scrub wizards of the coast from the face of the planet when possible as they do overprice on purpose things they don't want people to buy from the role playing game communtiy-  mongoose publishing has similar issues – the $75 traitors manual of the Paranoia RPG on amazon – as a minimum cost – so they are already going after you – how they can legally – but just going to say – I thank you for slipping this to me – they will go after you all the harder for doing that – and you will not be left alone a just a bunch of nerdy gamers – it is true that the NFL planned your extinction anyway – and I don't like giving into the negativity – like being pejorative against jocks – I find that non-productive and vengeful – being against like jocks just to be against them – as they were to nerds in school and yes I do have my stories on that- many of which I have told – mother just interrupted 10:23 EST – but having been persecuted for not believing sports was the end all and be all of life in high school – I don;t htink persecution is the appropriate way to strike and do the “eye for an eye” thing – however with the actual – actual pressure – address actual pressure-  criticize the movies that blatantly attack Role Palying games and any other actual pressure-  call that out -for what it is – but belittling people who like sports as a group is not a good idea.   Which some of you go towards harboring old hostility from more than likely – the “ideal years of high school” and perhaps college.  - fairer than fair the harold Washington model and motto which the other supporters of his did not like and I wasn't there to see him – don;t know if he is good or not-  but I like that idea.   With only perhaps a little safeguarding when someone is like trying to destroy – putting in some measures to deal with that.   

Ah – Yes we are living Fahrenheit 451 – just realized that- Children's Programming 
quiet reflection is not really encouraged in children – ewveryone is in a team – working together – probably saying yes we can in unison. 

KiDS incorporated – and Square One
Oh right I was supposed to like those kids sort of exploration shows  - I actually ran in fear from them – not fear  fear – but they like are something the most attention hungery child would watch such a president of the united States would watch – I'm here and everyone should pay attention to me – I ran the other way – and many things in that venue turn me right off – I liked quiet and weird where the cast member weren't shouting their numbers at you all the time – or that attracted me faster – some sort of exploration – not telling me that is fun – but something I could be curious about – again Mr Rogers – and of recent that was canceled quickly-  for younger children Booba – which was quiet – it had quiet pieces in it – the opening was exploratory -= and they yhanked it in a season for Dragontales – which made me cringe every time I saw it – and I was told on the phone at DAM – oh Dragontales is really popular by UNCTV listeners – we have tons of children at the events-  and I now know you can fix like that – looking it up – it's Boohbah and not booba – the latter being apparently the spelling of a gangster rap group or close to that and not what I had in mind – on the surface I should hate – it's about childhood activity – and I am overly fond of that aspect which is there – that kids or everly silly with and moving all the time – however -if you watch a show – first all the odd colors-  the are somewhat like looking at one of my drawings – strecth there a bit – but it is colorful – that appeals – looking skyward and sort invoking imagination all the time – liked that a lot – there are several quiet segments that focus on imagination – like the with british announcer tells the kids imagine a chair and the chair appears and they would have some thing they were trying to work out a puzzle – but a physical puzzle – I liked that – Pbs killed that in a year – also like the names aren't tommy and Johnny - - like dragontales is a self contained world you never leave-  boohbah is the opposite – you have to pronounce zin zing bah – which kind gets you ready to pronounce foreign names-  something many of my american colleagues seem to have difficulty with – they want a self- contained world with no outsiders – DAM liked the teletubbies  - which I didn't like – not sure completely – I didn't watch too much – but the more of it I watched  I liked less – Isle of Sodor – here's a thing – don;t pretend an object has properties it doesn't – you can make an imaginary character or a puppet do whatever – because a kid can understand that it's a puppet or eventually gets that-  don;t however  like make the sun a babies face smiling – as is done in teletubbies – or put face to trains and personalities to trains – Isle of Sodor – becuase you are giving false connotations to object-  seems harmless – it's not – thinking trains are good – leads to train collecting – harmless – leads to favoring amtrack over greyhound and fighting to keep a train system in the US when there is no logical reason to favor trains over busses – not so harmless – The sun is  not a happy baby – it is a very and relatively giant furnance – you don't have to scare kids with that as that leads to false connotations too – but making the sun out to be good when it is a force of nature may help make children falsely identify nature – connotate it is good a certain versus looking at it logically.  - DAM liked the teletubbies which automatically makes me suspicious.    Brother and sister cartoons – another series-  which I liked better because it was on – it was very suburban urban specific – Mr Roger's neigherhood and Boohbah are very vague could be anywhere – versus – towns have busses and you ride them as a kid – well that may not a good idea in your town and your town may not have busses and may not be this faux- happy community that doesn't really exist.  Mr Rogers did that-  of course he wasn't trying to present a full – fool children into thinking all neighborhoods are like this – and that is where perhaps a little off on him – the way he presents it – children might think neighborhoods are suppsoed to be that way – but I didn't get that out of it – and I am glad he is not like more recent things-  see this is what a neighborhood is – a land of strawberry shortcake- earlier email on why I don;t like strawberry shortcake and the care bears which are too perfect -every in my neighborhood works out – the best shows didn't get into that too much – the ones I liked the most didn't get into a specific neighborhood too – why do I bet New yorkl City the set for at least 2 Pbs shows- it is featured now – Sesame Street recent opens blatantly use NYC skyline and reading rainbow is in NYC  – doesn't reflect accurately other places well and that has always been a problem – and instead of leaving that – we have gone more towards it – that New York City is the Ideal – and I will say it is not – first it doesn't have walmart – second you can't see any stars – and there  are thirds and fourth and fifths where perhpas – I've given them – it is not allowing forth a full and diverse venue of art – it shuts out any themes in theater that are not city dominant and many themes today are not – the internet age is not about a big urban city – the giant dense neighborhood is not a great settlement pattern for providing different opportunities to people  - And I cna even arue the founding fathers would not approve of the NYC model – what made the US harder to conquer initially was spreading out the population and not having at the time Philadelphia be the center of the country – the British could conquer philadelphia but it didn't matter-  too many now look at NYC as the leader – and it is not leading in many cultural aspects – it does not want to address any social issues where it does not come out on top and unfortunately in many issue it does not now.  It's the wrong model.  Cities  only provide some living opportunities and some work opportunities – not all of them – and having access to both urban and rural would be a better optimum – hunt and shop at the mall and go to broadway within a day as options – if like those different sets of peopole didn't want to kill each other -  they don't completely – MANY OF THEM JUST WANTED TO FOUND SEPARATE COUNTRIES – SO WE'RE DOING MUCH BETTER NOW.   Coughing as I write that

Zaboomafo – sort of like Bolt – aren't animals cute – even if they do warn you like not – or you see them she away all the other animals as they bring in the wolverines – not a perosn – a real wolverine – and they monkeys really quickly – but the “animals are your friends idea” is kind of in the thing that you can talk with them in a somewhat homelike setting 

1:36 EST 12/24/08 - accidentally pasted email addresses in here at first - make that mistake a lot - mccain.senate.gov - mccain's website the events are slow down - automatic name and address choice tabs slow down in their application of the chosen anem and address and email - site is a little slow - it is Christmas.  



Look it's 1:20 am – I am waiting for my check to be recognized in Bank of America – WHICH IT IS NOT – BUT I HOPEFUL BY 2 am they will clear the Federal Government Electronic Deposit – 12/24/08 – staying up to shall we say take advantage of certain things – before others get a big window to change them in – and I have this neat chance to look at hulu and all these shows we are showing teenagers and in my sleep deprived mind it is dawning on me how well we are warping teenagers right now. 
Just think of this in the 90s a big thing was the push for science – make science “cool” that was a theme – and we had  things on PBS - “Dragonfly TV” - sponsored by Best Buy and also “Fetch with Ruff ruffman” which I wrote up for something – I found a new problem with it – and right now I am watching something called first hand – it starring a skateboarder and yes many of the TV shows today for young people star skateboarders and very “active” teens – we don;t wnat children sitting around – we want them “active” - and the push in the 90s was to “make science cool” - which on the PBS shows meant active things-  showing kids sailboating and surfind and skateboarding and biking over mountain terrian – and that was cool and outdoor real science – about as far from sitting down and pondering and thinking as you can get – and it does look cool – but it is only now in retrospect when reflecting on the above mentioned shows that I see something else-   NO ONE READS ANY BOOKS – NO ONE SITS DOWN FOR LIKE TWO SECONDS AND THINKS – NO ONE PONDERS – QUESTIOSN – IT'S ALL DOING STUFF !!!!  - and that isn't real – what's more – it's face paced to keep a child's attention is the sale point to the programmer – it also encourages activity as the goal and not reading or questioning in a slow way – an actual thinker is not looked up to – it is doing “stuff” - sports really – active “stuff” - and that is only half of any invention – the other half is crafting it – and that is not windsurfing or dirt bike riding – both dragon fly TV and Fetch with Ruff ruffman feature – Fetch is a current program still -  not really old – only a few years old- and the kids are very active-  when do they read – or are looked up to for doing quiet activities - - it is harder to show that on TV – but what comes out of it is – “you are cool if you are active and do something active- you are not cool if you sit alone for a while or do something alone – Fetch and dragonfly TV always show the children in groups – whoever thinks alone – others aren't there generally when you ponder something – why do they brainstorm in groups – and jsut act – that doesn't work with everything – some things – and yes both shows reward active children the taciturn kid in the back has been executed on PBS somewhere and the same on many other teen shows and I am starting to see what we have done.    Compare dragonfly TV – I bet with 3 – 2 -1 contact or Mr rogers – dragonfly TV would give Mr roger's Neighborhood a heart attack.   But even 3-2-1 contact – more time asking questions and not glamorizing - “Activity” - there's plenty of others doing that. 


the “New Environmentalism”
I was watchgin “Desperate Landscapes” - sort of “Extreme Makeover” - another “favorite sow of mine that I have commented on earlier -  the first reaction

Mother theresa I know you feed the poor and help millions in poverty and you may get to be a saint – but ya that yew tree in the front of your yard looks really unsightly and your landscaping is unkempt and may damage my property value and your lawn really is a “desperate landscape” - ARRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!! - I am beginning to understand why the people after hurricane ike voted air conditioning over water as the thing they missed most. 

It's called the new environmentalism – because the typical american lawn and the “ideal” landscape with those neatly trimmed hedge from an ecological standpoint SUCKS – you ripped out a bunch of low maintenance grass and cut down tons of branches off a tree and put higher maintenance plants that will require more upkeep and a landscape that requires upkeep – the tree does not like having branches cut off it – and however much the “neighbors” like what was done – the runoff is worse – the grass that was overgrown held the water better – versus the barkmulch – not barkmulch but some sort of mulch bed and that is not a plant with roots – they ripped out a bunch of smaller trees I guess with roots with disrupts the soil and anything living underneath the soil as things do – a lot of things live in the soil - - soil is alive-  unelss chem lawn comes in  - another “friend of mine” - poison the lawn for bugs – yes and all the spider and earthworms and everything else you shouldn't poison either- you hurt tons of plants- it net is less water absorbant – a reason to have greenery on a property and it will reuqire more not less maintenance – how is this better agian? - Oh the neighbor's like – right right – the new environmentalism at its best. 

and the opinion of other homeowners dictates how you should live your life – ugggghhh – what the neighbors think of your property determiens whether you are successful – there was a REASON for the picket fences of New England – it's called get the hell off my land and stay that way – it will be a MN winter day in hell before I care what my neighbors think of my property – they have no right – it's not their headache  - but the property value – yes and that is the perfect reason to declare houses liabilities and not assets – so that neighbors are a tad less concerned about how you mow your lawn – that apparently is more important than like feeding the poor or inventing and I think that is a reversed value system to me.

for the record it was galileo galilei – there was another book a regular paperback novel we had to read that was the one they wouldn't answer a question about – but on acting out galileo galilei in class -they gave her a hard time about something – they way they said recant – the calss had decided on her that it should be said ree-cant – or something and she wanted it – re- caant – different accent – they were telling her to go to hell or something – didn't say that just wouldn;t say it the way she asked when acting out the play and then the thing with not answering questions for the whole class was revenge – and I didn't get why that was such a big deal – why they'd pulled – I was stunned they tried that make her get up in class for 50 minutes and not cooperate at all and they all agreed – no one else bucked them.   From what I remember she wasn't being spiteful – she had an idea of how a play should sound – and she asked for one thing.   -  and yes in honesty it wasn't necessarily 50 minutes – it was the whole time we were in class uninterrupted – we may have had to leave for the trip to weselyan – it was a thing – we got to go to weselyan – and we may have had to go that day – and like in 20 minutes of silence or this game she said okay we're going to weselyan and had us leave – but yes it did happen - - it happened for long enough that I knew they were going to do it. 

with the free shipping on amazon – walmart does not always have the best price in mail-order – and in honesty I don't like a lot of the 4th edition as I said in the reviews of the stuff I did get at walmart – in addition walmart has actually delivered every product it has given me or refunded it in the cases where it was broken – but that was a 2007 theme in walmart and amazon – the fun of early 2007 – the 3rd party sellers on amazon and then the sellers on ebay are the ones where sometimes - things can go “awry a tad” and if my intent is to expose – buying a lot from a reliable retail site is not in the interest of what I am doing unless there is something I absolutely want delivered – in the I am sure I will be dealing with walmart and amazon DIRECTLY in the future as both tend to have things I want on different items.  I prefer in general dealing with amazon over ebay – except that currently the price tag on many amazon third party sales has oddly risen – but in general that is untrue – and there are a still a few things I will “explore”  - walmart can pout like Pittsburgh did when i went to Walmart in north Fayette over some of the Strip district fruit outlets.

ebay -several of my bids are coming due – the computer is slowing on ebay – harder to get up pages – coming up slower – 20 second delay- which is significant – gettign sleepy – 21:48 EST 12/23/08 – will try to fight to do a few little tricks -  you can't get delivery by tomorrow- christmas eve if you order on ebay now – it's too late – some slow down – but none yesterday or day before which should have been stronger sale days and none earlier today-  only now at 21:50 Est – it seems more linked to my bids than the demand of Christmas shoppers – who as the hours tick by should less and less by using ebay.  - Marking ad appeared on role playing games – heading on ebay – puple outlined 28 day ad  appeared on role playing games – how they traditionally marked it -

It appears I just had the knob turned down on cbn like last night – I did turn it down when kfyo went on  and then when I turned kfyo off – found the right screen – I forgot to twist the knob back – used to not make that – error that is new – 20:48 EST – to make it so frequently as well.   And the forgot to turn it back – that is odd – I used to remember- gremlin .  - cbn is working again. 

God help – oh wait – others are close to him – I get it now when Europeans say stuff in that very omentic – omen-style way – very obtuse – cards tight to chest or vest or cassock – way – I did go to weselyan and we did talk of Galileo Galilei  - something liek that was his last name – that was a memorable we had a female english teacher  for senior year who did make it a point to be more “professional” with the young men then others on the staff – she was not well liked or – this is the good example – I guess it shows a lot of what was to come – I think it was this play – galileo galilei – we read or were supposed to and everyone read it – there is pressure on my head as I tell this Xavier story -  some democrat is marking it in their book to kill off any kid in high school who does what I did – the US inquisition coming soon – Hni DAM – but yes I was telling a story not foretelling the fate of others – we read that play and all my other classmates including my more famous on wikipedia counterpart who was in that class with me – they all got together and decided not to answer a single question for the english teacher for the whole period – they decided not to give one correct answer  and let her stand there and get nothing – they all got together-  these are the honors track students- the straight A people – my “peers” in high school – the good people – they colluded before class and just decided – they didn't like her for some reason and were going to give her a real hard time – they asked me to join them – I said no – I was the only student for the whole period answering questions – she noticed – and others said things occassionally but made sure they were wrong of that they would forget to say things-  get called and then say – they forgot what they were going to say – she never said thank you overtly – but did not give a hard time in 2 instances one may have been before and one after - - I never knew why they just group attacked her like that-  bu it was one of the meaner things i saw done to a teacher – and it was on that play – she did something – we went to our weselyan meeting for high schools and when she came back she did something -   she was not sure of herself and did not fit in as well to the school and just she was vulnerable to that sort of thing and I remember the instigator or the person who asked me to go along– hi there kenya  – I'm not dead yet. 

cbn.com radio of christmas carols – it was working fine this afternoon and I listened to it for an hour – now it is cycling – several times – loading up on the audio windoiw and seeming to make it and then laoding up again – the graphic doesn't change- just the words on the bottom of the audio window – I have  seen this error before on toher radio sites - - not sure who induces it – hacker or other – but  cbn radio worked fine this afternoon.   Why it does not now – 8:19 Est 12/23/08

DAM – didn't even tell me what was in their 401k – I filled out a survey at DAM and I volunteered the information on my retirement survey that I owned stocks – dumb-  but I was naive and didn't think the company I was working for in 2002 would try to kill me and never in my wildest mind did it occur they would find out what sotcks I own and try to control their value – which they did starting in 2003 – that is when things happened -   antoher survey got me to volunteer my compuer information – what body and type of computer I had – which led to spyware on my computer and later the virus – it was a different world – DAM seemed to use the 401 k – like it used the employee money in it – in the games that go on in fixing the market – and the 401 k mutual funds are essentially – wrote the line below – but the 401 k funds are essentially the pool of money companies cna use to fix the market and like destroy my wealth and whomever they want – the employees' funds are used like pawns-  the employees' retirement account is a pawn of the stock market players who actually manage and cotnrol it – they ried to leave us clueless about what was in the matched retirement fund – and I wouldn't go into it – good thing – it vests in 6 years – I left in 6 months.

Insurance and Fire Lose from System Improvements
apparently I was told to be more clear about something I said earlier – with firemen – balloon fram versus platform frame construction – even using wood – there are ways to reduce fire – platform frame construction reduces fire hazards in wooden homes and that is what is used to day-  before that we had balloon framed houses – in fact apparently they were made until 1930 – the reat depression – what I did not call out well is that – during the depression apparently from what I could gather and I had trouble on the internet tracing the introudction of platform framing – but platform framing was used to reduce fires – the point being – firemen or fireman or fireperson perhaps today si a good paying job and in 1930 it was a job to have – and that was good – and you didn't need an education – or a strong one – so having it depends on having fires to put out – and if you got laid off in 1930 you weren't getting another decent job and during the 1930s a housing type was introduced that would have reduced the number of fires – therefore just as firemen needed their jobs most – they were finding out their job security was going away- and that was a high pressure time – and this pressure may have indcued the idea – hey why not set a few fires to put to justify their existance – as fire investigators they are the prime people to understand how to put out fires and also hwo they are caused – it is likely their job to investigate fire cause – they put that knowledge to use to save the jobs and their buddies and that may have helped instill a corrupt culture- was there a major drop in the number of fires or need for firemen per capita between say 1930 and 1950?-   platform framing was the last major archtiectural  innovation – after that nothing has essentially happened for 70 years-  there are better steel and different claddings of course-  but very little has changed since 1930  - BECAUSE – developers – emergency personnel – stell makers – carpenters – all of them have a vested financial interest in not having a more efficient enclosure creating and space making systme – for job, home, retail, or institution – they all don;t wnat that improved if it means less money- insurance also  would not like buildings that do not need to be isnured – either for as much or at all – because the owner can just buy a new one and the insurance isn't worth it – insurance makes money off of insuring expensive things-  system efficiency brings costs down – making insurance less necessary which is why for insurance – high healthcare and auto costs and keeping an auto are essential to the industry and stopping mass transit – letting health costs fall – the insurance industry also hates innovation.   They all want to block innovation for monetary reason – if your broken arm cost $200 verus $5,000 to set or worse if you set it yourself – in which scneario woudl yo uneed medical insurance – if you set the arm yourself and piad out the cost of materials say $50 OR if you go to the hospital and spend $5000 – even if you get hospital costs or even if you still go to the shopital for very hard things like brain surgery -seeing as that got mentioned on mark Levin last night – today is 12/23/08  - only needed coverage for major operations is probably less expensive then if you want coverage for borken arms and other less complicated injuries-  and the insurance company cannot justify as high a premium to you – everyone loses financially if the system improves and they are too short sighted to see – that is historically what happens and new businesses open up and it is all okay – but getting those system improvements is essential to include more of the world in the ecnomy and create more jobs and have more wealth to go around the world –  IT IS WRONG TO STARVE 5 BILLION PEOPLE SO THAT 1 BILLION DO NOT HAVE TO CHANGE JOBS – AND THAT IS WHAT IS PLANNED.  

mother just came as I write paragraph below 14:00 EST 12/23/08

um the congressional website for the hosue asked for the numbers in a sequence – it's a simple sequence and I got it – I do have a problem with that – like there are a lot of people who can't do math – that almost gets to be close to the “literacy tests” of the south – if you cannot figure out the puzzle – you cannot write your congressman – complete the next number in the sequence – 19,20,21,22 – and yes it is 23 – studipidty and /or lack of english understanding – blindness - - I guess the same with the graphic letter puzzles – but doing math problems – there are a few people I know who might be able to email – but could not do math on demand – like don't ask 5! - most people won't get that. 

And The Person 2 B Crowned The Next President Is . . . .
question and thought – how about thought-  We not mix the miss america pageant and the presidential constest – now the president can in theory be a woman – though that was put in doubt this year – but yes – from now on as one of the new debates we can have the presidential swimsuit competition – and then have the president dress in eveningwear - - the talent competition – Clinton plays Sax – Obama does basketball  - perhaps Joe biden will due marksmanship when hunting – or maybe I am thinking of someone else – and like we could have crowns and parting for the runner up – for various reasons – having dealt perhaps with Presidentail candidate Kerry – i am not sure the runner up should fulfill presidential duties if the President is unable to fulfill them as I think may president's might suffer more ILLNESS if the order of succession were changed like that – still – how about a presidential beauty pagenat as part of selection process- or perhaps just make it oficial – we seem to be doing that anyway.   UUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!   - Maybe Medusa could be the first female president- 

to those it concerns 750 wsb has proprietary streaming formats – I can purchase them – I haven't done so in the past – I am uncertain and think it is not desired at this time – meaning the station is linux compatible – provided the user spends his own dough and gets the fomrat patch he or she needs to hear the station – and I am not going to do that for various reasons that were decided before- IF a certain person changes their tune on that – it can be done – it is not very expensive $15 or $50 I would assume – the price is in Euros.   Rubbeding right nose edge with right index knuckle.

It does appear I should not judge a book or a card by its cover – as they say.  - but someone could have put a less scary image for me – and probably used both – jsut to show -

An economics professor used an example in class – it seemed funnier now than it is currently and I didn't get it fully until years later when a light clicked and it made sense – I am going to modify ti a little to fit a different understanding – there's an economy and you can choose leaders  - If you choose way A – your team's economy goes up 50% and the other team's economy goes up 100%   - if you choose way B your team's economy goes up 10% and the other team's goes up 5% - which do you choose  - in the original question if adapted – people choose way B – because they are beating the other team versus taking the better standard of living  - scratched right side of head with right fingers – and in many ways that represents well what is happening now.

Um ass a thoght that popped in from a while ago – the military height and weight are they skewed to keep certain people with certain features out – certain people that are in shape but just like for example – pull ups are difficult – one might wonder at those standards – they favor certain people and their genetic makeup over others-  I was thinking that earlier and I know women struggle with those standards and they sued to keep me out long enough to get me into a mental hospital – and I bet they horseshoe people through who may not quite make it-  stuff like that ahppens – where as if they don't want you or someone doesn't – it is an impossible barrier as much as is possible – a line up scratched right should with right hand – or 2 lines up – when writing the favoring others part.  - scratching back of neck as I plant to go to ebay with left hand

We are allowing the media to create false images -  OH NO – THAT'S NOT ALL OF IT BUSTER – PLENTY OF REAL PEOPLE WANT FALSE IMAGES TO BE TRUE – THEY WANT THEM – THE MEDIA IS GUILTY – BUT SO ARE THE NETWORKS OF PEOPLE – OBAMA COULD NOT DO THIS ON HIS OWN.

ellan from what I read might have been competent – Lincoln at one point undermined his strategy from what I read and we say McLellan was too cautious – but Lincoln was too aggressive in wanting to go fast and pushed a McLellan strategy at one point into failure -  Bush wants some mroe time – I wouldn't  be surprised. 

Face nothing like the civil war – ummm – maybe more like what – civil hostile takeover – something like that versus civil war. 

angry liberal callers – who do not want to talk to Rush – nothing wrong with trip to HI – I know I can afford to do that – actually I could – I would figure out a way – but why does he get a pass there – he's supposed to fix the mess?   Bush got plastered for going to Crawford.

rewscending energy plan – I have heard it – atmos – you have played it several days -

fire in lubbock – there havne't been as many announcements of them recently

these people are nuts – they believe like in control of things – wow – that they believe it's okay is what I have huge issues with
*
def of liberals – 2 com 1 question – sources of radio and Tv for left commentary – migrate conservative from conservative to liberal – I think  that's a globasl warming or loss of daylight argument – limbaugh     -caller-  belief in entitlement -  more responsibility over great time is the trend – personal ownership new concept from serfdom – kings owned owned everything – ownership new concept 200 years - -  I don;t buy his premise – more freedom is a new thing by 200 years to 2000 or 10.000 – coudl say more will email   - the last beleif in entitlement is saying I feel entitle – yes I have right to life liberty and happiness chump – deal with it – I do feel entitled to that and not being surveyed and monitored and harassed by people who are preventing my free thought – I do feel entitled – and right to earn money and others – keeping it short

yes my grades were qualized a bit – and yes CMU – architecture – I ended up with a B average C's in sutdio which the professors assign rades based on how well they think of your project – and A's in classes outsdie of studio many times and my GPA goes up half a grade if you exclude all studio classes. 

socialism they would not buy – liberalism they would – possible – yes

Melissa – happy friday Mr Kane - - liberal don't hang up – donating TV to pawn shop - $48 bucks – I don't watch TV – and didn't this morning – gov't makes everyone equal of a libewral according to caller-  2 weeks talk listener – no non-conservative talk radio host – H – liberal shows need money – be competitive with audience -  she is getting the host to say competition – of course liberal forces don't use talk radio talk radio while conservatives do – liberal money doesn ot steer listeners to talk radio – and could – by CHOICE it chooses not to – so I don't buy liberal voices silenced if market is let to run.   - they fix things because they want to use talk radio against the right – destroy it and kill right set-up system -  Host using daughter's grades as an example of merit – host when father and turned it – host turned it into a level the playing field example where giving to others takes away from those who earned it worked harder – the host may not realize some liberals do not want selected groups to work harder – their objective is to make no  one work hard – but get used to being a slave – the 2 tiered society I have written about – and someone is text copying what I am writing – anyoway – I will send. 

David pleasure to tlaking to you – pluto – left $100 bill – Dallas – service desk – Christmas – service desk – still honest people iwth faith and integrity – because bill  returned  - don't compromise morals-   comment drop   - siomilar situation at pitt told to keep it by guards with $20 bill for me – trying a – I am better than you – not exact same situation – security guards in my case said – we don't want to keep it-  no one can claim it well – and $100 bill in his case – not $20

rapid fire friday – ARRRGGGHHHHHH!!! Herman   no

let me guess they aren't supposed to use half of this stuff against a civillian – the NFL daughter is the woman on Levine from Michigan who I can clearly point to as signalling I was off the radio – not listening – I noted it on 12/22/08 show

kfyo – that room of stink comment about his daughter – it came up as I was trying to recollect a search I wanted to do for an item at amazon and under the pressure I could not remember the search -for that phrase – even though I knew it was coming-  now it was an item I am not familiar with – and I knew I wnated to do a search and I didn't remember the item the instant the person got off – so maybe I was jsut having trouble-  that is becoming common – where a hostile person's voice comes in on kyo and interrupts my thoughts – seems to be a military- as KFMB did it first – I will grow better at dealing with it – it has not succeeded every time  and I was more vulnerable with a first tiem info – they picked their attack – and someone could hold the name of the search from my mind during the commercial to give them an apparent “victory” - when maybe a gremlin cheated it a little for them. 

as a festivus – the kfyo password for my login – I never get in on the first try or rarely – there is always  a mistake and they use that mistake somehow to track me – not kfyo – someone else 9:37 Est 12/23/08

paulson name drop – I guess one of the heads of the “national chamber of commerce” and not really a friend. 

I love4(to use)  excoriate – I use it a lot – the word I mean – not what it is -

Don't Make the USA into a Ball Game
yes baseball and football fix who wins – with gremlins and now with the salary  managemen of wealth teams as well and oddly my left shoulder does hurt – and so President Bush's ho ho – on news earlier his hurts – kfyo - - and yes it is not in Baseball or Football net interest to develop the best team or the best player – it is in their interest to attract fans-  however for society the goals are reversed  - the best and brightest was the catch phrase – and football and baseball and retail gets that that is not necessarily the way to generate the biggest market-  new inventions and ideas can get rid of old products – too quickly to make a profit – so the owners and managers will tunr the US  - run it like it is the NFL – the issue is some alien race may not play along – and will kick our ass for not developing as fast as we can – and they have said bull on that- they want money over health of race – nice to have idiots like this in charge – who feel competitve teams are better than lone genius's and are actively trying to kill them off- how many competitive invented things – the world wide web was an individual – so was electric light – flight – lone geniuses have done better than any sports team or competitive team at pushing society forward – competition is not the strongest goal or optimum goal to encourage and foment strong competition – you end up with Ur-Draxa – the center of power for the Dragon of Dark Sun and it is hinted that Ur-Draxa is dying - – you do not end up with the best society  - but you see your kid getting a better job or high dollar income and that is good and your vision goes no farther than that-  that you are eroding any improvements to societal functioning and that in time that is the game. 

Nothing is Going On on Amazon
the 1st edition of deities and demigods – oddly which I have- on amazon is priced  $3.95 – on amazon low price deities and demigods 3rd edition – which I don't have and might want -on amazon is $22.93   - the new books are 3.5 or 4th edition – it is a newer book than 1st edition  – but is also out of print – and there are no wacky price differences between amazon and ebay on items like this – they are scumbags – 8:52 12/23/08 – 99 cent fiend folo I think it was – one of the 1st ed hardbound books that I have on ebay this morning.   - and mother was at my door asking if I want to help with christmas cookies – NO and I know you know what I type. 

kfyo silenced – needed to restart firefox to fix 8:38 EST – cut a little of the interview


I went to Duquesne small business center – I was directed their by CCAC – does everyone else decide if you will get business at first to some degree.   People would find out about me because of that visit in 2001 ish – they got to look me over. 

business associations – political supporters-  so like Kerry Obama – did the NFL – and  Mcdonald's and all of them who didnt like me – there is the link – the chamber of commerce networks a connection between political and commercial  and also for terrorism purposes – the chamber of commerce could coordinate that-  did not listne to the full interview.   Many retailers don't like what I have to say. 

amazon - how did jewish women in america as a book deal with a search for enclclopedia of Demons and Devils  just curious

Sex Ed addendum
I do not think it is a good thing to encourage heterosexual children to be homosexual – and I worry about that being agenda of some – and I find htat agaisnt societal interest – we may have a fuller discussion of sex in secondary school in time – and sexuality – at the moment – too many people have alternative agendas – and trying to like equalize the way people have sex or are – no – procreation does have a purpose – it may be part of the natural process that not everyone is that way – but encouraging aberration – no – you can explain and tolerate homosexuality to a lare – maybe not perfect without using sex education to encourage abberrations in people – and that is what you are doing if you are too hard “trying to “make people comfortable” with their gay side – it is used like that – to make more people gay and not straight – it is one thing to be afraid of being gay – but it is equally wrong to overencourage and almost push a person to be gay or bisexual or a lesbian. 

So sex Education Again and I am in Trouble wih Gay Community For Not Going All the Way
I am worried that if – truly gay children may need guidance-  true – but is any guidance presented done in a way to encourage straight children to become gay – I am not for that – you may say I don't tolerate because i nthe youngest years I don't want a lot of information out on being gay – I have evidence that some groups can try to make someone gay and one way to do that is to use overeducation – it would make it easier to do that-  I want to open the pandora's box – how much is being gay natural or being straight and how much can it be encouraged – and I think it can be encouraged or people wouldn't try to do that – and I am against playing like that – if a child has questions handle them as they come – but do not prompt them for a while – do not encourage experimentation or promiscuity with sex – it shouldn't be mentioned much before teenage years – explained – but not getting into homosexuality – different rapes – anyone under 13 should not need to know all of that.  - whatever is allowed – I don't want to leave too much of a door open to encouraging being homosexual – or that it can be used to be homosexual – full approval would of course be saying whatever – educating – we are not ready for that – we just aren't ready-  there are enough problems on other issues – for now mentioning that other people are there is enough – I might be for a course on gender a little later – but I worry that would be abused – like in high being clear on sexuality and not being afraid of it – either gay or straight – there it makes more sense – but there will be too many misconceptions – at first when teaching that – in earlier years – I think presenting everything just encourages issues – definitely the 7 year old – teach about rape – is a little much – which Obama was for – I would only carefully on an individual basis get into – sex with a younger child – in time sex could be handled as part organ discussion with other organs in  3rdd grade – without getting into more than how a baby develops not – the biology – and when humans reach maturity – and that they don't usually have sex and there isn't much good reason for it to happen until puberty or much older- and leave it there.    - Also in high school – like actually one of the “excuses” for a religion is a class on essentially what it means to be a man and a woman in catholic doctrine – but a course on essentially beign human  and it's not like a pass out of the condoms course and something like when dealing with everything that you hear as a reference point and that to seniors in high school – was a good idea.  I can easily if not handled right how sex education can be sued to corrupt children and it is done.

apparently the sign of choice this morning – rubbing privates as I am about to email clintonfoundation.org I beleive.  7:19 Est 12/23/08

7:12 EST kfyo – 12/23/08 – the disrescptful total transformation as I get on  - it did block me from writing up – I dug into the emotion instead of skimming – I wanted to say that and they are trying again – the gas and amedical bill -reverse mortgage – I am trying to say that the attack on my computer was a littel stronger than it normally is – not just a browser restart got back the radio – shutting off the computer is what I needed to do to fix the problem and hear the radio – didn't try a user switch first and I should have tested that – but it was a more severe attack – the way I know how did it or guess – if I turn off the comptuer and try users and it's still silent – it is usually my side doing the silencing – and they do that – GET OFF KFYO WE WANT SOMEWHERE ELSE TODAy – they are cowboys and I am the cattle – ugggh – when the other side does it – I can usually get it restrated by at most shutting down the comptuer – though user switching in one instance cured something a shut down did not.  - rubbiing private at writing that statement.

they shot off that repeating loop error thing and shut down my browser - instead of fixing the accoutn I switched accounts - just tosee what happens - because they expect me to kill a prcoess - whcih someone watching my computer can see - and I didn' and I wonder if that changes things 6:59 eST 12/23/08 – browser givne error – the repeating audio loop error when I attempted to use yahoo mail. 


My Fellow Racist Americans at Their Best
hard to note calls- with the circumnavigation I do not get down every comment I want to – it is difficult – I bet their network is only so strontg – it has a lot of tiers – while they have people – they will run out – or make mistakes – like they did last night – let's dance – 18:47 EST 12/22(23)/08

The Other Part of the Mark Levin show  12/22/08 – 6:17 EST 12/23/ 08 – well 10pm on this day 3 years ago is when I got hauled into the mental hospital – just as a footnote -

go distracted about the fact I advocated the electric company theme song for use in torture and that I advocate to others – I guess in certain circumstances whatever someone feels is necessary to get information is okay – there are times – itching hand – they are trying to infinite loop my mind or distract it – to not let me write up this part before 7:00 Est – I bet let's start

um as a note – I heard the electric company several times on youtube – I had it up almost then decided to try to tune into show – Levin show last night – and like when they really silenced Kfyo in a way I needed to restart the browser because it was up – I heard it when I reopened the browser it started playing on the refresh – because firefox saves a point of web history and what you have open starts and does not record if you had the clip or audio stream paused – it plays them all – and that was their victroy song – in addition they wanted to know when I started to hear Levin's show – with Mark Simone – last night and they were keeping track

the MI caller – she was on as a I left – phlegm is called(coming) up – the Michigan caller a woman – after the guy essentially saying Kennedy didn't get to be president for so long because he did not support WWII – she said we should return maybe to a simpler way of life – among other things – not totally for the big 3 – but saying the rules got so complicated – the call was on the big three – very close to hour break in the show – an hour through it  -  the simpler way of life – maybe a new country without the rules of the current US – that references is there – the more important thing to me – she said when she knew I left or something I didn't hear of hears – and probably when I hit the button to turn kfyo off after turning down the dial cause I wanted to write-  she gave the thing about – I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I got cut off right before I would have gone on -   on the allen hunt show on sunday – I called into the phone bank repeatedly and until 45 minutes into the hour and kept getting busy signals and then got the call screener who did hang up on me as we did get into an argument – she was referencing that and that I was no longer on the line -listening to the radio it would appear – THE CALLS AFTER HERS WERE VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT TO THE POINT UNLIKE THE OTHER CALLS – WHEN I WAS OFF COULDN'T HEAR – THE CALLS WERE DIRECT AND CLEAR – NOT CIRCUMNAVIGATING CALLS LIKE THE HOSTS USUALY GET WHEN I WAS LISTENING AND THAT IS PROBABLY WH MOTHER WAS UP – SHE KNEW I WOULD SEE IT – ONLY THE LEVIN SHOW CAN I HEAR THE REBROADCAST  AND CATCH THEM  FOR SURE – OTHERS ONCE IN A WHILE – BUT LEVIN I COULD ACCESS PARTICUALR MOMENTS AND THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL IN SPOTTING THIS GAME – LATER THEY WILL TEST WHAT I MISSED – HERE THEY ARE NOTING I LEFT THE AUDIO LINE 

Chuck in AZ – merry xmas – straight point about GM workers with 95% of pay in month off- I thought that was Chrysler and not GM -

Mark Simone – was making points on Presidnet's ex salaries and pay – a caller later would bring up LBJ and reveal I did not hear that – by his call – he started talkiing about the president LBJ and making money and I had no idea at the time – and he was checking if I heard that-  I had the audio stream on – but did not realize for a while it was turned down – so it made it harder for them to know what I heard or did not hear. 

Anthony called NY – merry xmas to america and all troops – he was saying a football fan – simone cut him off-  I did hear this initially and they didn't want to – there is apparently a clear franc off the airwaves so we can speak amongst ourselves thing going on – another simple 2 line call – Obama will isten to Biden – who was trashing dick cheney and it was on the foreign policy of Dick cheney and Joe biden – but caller did not circumnavigate – wehre within a call as soon as I was listening hey started to circumnavigate again – give a big story -

Bob Jamestown Ny – and this is referenced by other callers later – who like him – and I didn't get all of that – but a roofer – Amercian Workers and American Labor are the best  - better htan foreign workers and the foreign plants – didn't even like Toyota with foreign owned plants with American workers – ahd to be all american workers-  pure racism – the host played banjo music for this call – I didn't write that down – the next caller mentiioned it so then I noted it – and yes I – I knew the host was playing with bob – and I would probably treat that call in a somewhat similar fashion - 

Scott in Northern VA – I heard part of this call – but was just getting back into the swing of thing-  Simone – the substitute host – told on air he received LBJ emails – um that may have clued the other in that I could hear – if  - I did not when I came back hear the comment on the banjo – but the comment on perfect host – I heard that – but I think from Keith – the next caller who said something similar and I think it was him I got – I heard the end maybe of this call – rubbing left eye and eyebrow with right first two fingers - - this guy had Bernie meydoff versus madoff – so until the host corrected him you didn't know what he was talking about -  and my computer shut down as I got on -which would warn the others I coudl hear-  not computer- but he hackers did kfyo at this point in the program – they silenced it and I know that because I had to correct it and could – and that is how everyone knew I could hear the broadcast again potentially – and there is little I can do unless I play and that takes tiem -

the next call Keith – was really circumnaigating again – so they function together – there is a group of educated who are normal calls and who can circumnavigate and if they clear the line of me – then they have others who could not confront me at all come on the line – and they keep track of when I am on and when I am off and what I heard and what I didn't hear as a group – and the behavior matches – now I cannot prove that-  but again noting what transpired.  



last call on Levin Milwaukee WI -  coughing as I write it up this way - I listened to this call again – I did not get out last night that the condemning adultery – I usethe bible reference a lot of – lot the first person who is not a sinner cast the first stone – Jesus told others not to hit an adulterer – and I use that a lo when arguin for gay tolerance – that Jesus tolerated people like leppers and adulterers – yet supposedly according to the Christian he hates gay people – yet in his life he never exhibited hate to any group – but perhaps whitened sepulchers – people who pretend to be what they are not – in religion and in life – but I use the adultress example a lot and that guy was making a reference to me – I picked on it last night – I just didn't manage to write it down – passed gas as I started writing this section in first two lines - - he was also testing if I heard the hosts earlier comment about the planets and I did not – I was listening at the time – but I was writing as the host was slipping in a point - - with more reflection time – I also see – the sun could put out the same amount of net solar energy and be giving or emitting it from different places – like fires wouldn't emit the same amount of solar energy all the way around even if the fire had the same amount of net output – so the planet warming and cooling -and more planets cooling – than warming – there are many ways to explain that – the host was going one – orbits – pluto in particular and uranus have wacky orbits – plut the most wacky – as I recollect – but it's not really a planet -  rubbed or itched right side of head with rhyumb on stating – oh a graphic window popped up for print screen – and then rabbed right hand with left as a I put it down and mother was up here at 5:55 EST as I listened to the video – not video – but audio feed of the mark levin show and it was damaging – I will go into up top – of this section – I write this paragraph first

mistype on ww.ebay.com 5:18 EST 12/23/08 – went into  us seek so I don't know what I typed.

<---GAP ---> not the store

apparently someone decided I heard enough and when I turned off kfyo and turned it back on – I found out it was shut off and I could not get it back on and I tried to fix it – and I would bet someone decided I ahd heard enough as a michigan caller was getting on – probably to let me know they would push harder yet until I cracked – cause the union will win -  NO MATTER HOW WRONG IT IS – HOW MUCH IT WILL BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY THE UNION WILL WIN - - and I am the weakling – perhaps it was a good time to quite for a while.  I coudl have heard the rest – I would be more upset maybe we will see.   It was 21:02 Est when the computer shut down – 12/22/08 or kfyo was silenced – the computer is fine – I had the volume down – I turned the knob dopwn – didn't realize – 21:25 Est – odd to not realize that


ya – I was hoping that wasn't it – but yeah – kennedy's not allowed to be president-   I DIDN'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT I WANTED TO GO IN THE MILITARY AND HAD NO ASPIRATIONS TO BE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME – AND YOU SAID i COULDN'T AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT – FROM WHAT i GET YOU BROKE (a rule) TO DO THAT – AND PUSH ME OUT – KEENEDY WANTED HIS CHILDREN AS PRESIDENT AND THAT IS A PRIVALEGE NOT A RIGHT – YOU TOOK AWAY SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO – WITH KENNEDY HE DEMANDED SOMETHING THAT HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED – THERE IS A DIFFERENCE – AND KENNEDY SUPPORTED HITLER – OR REALLY CHAMBERLAIN – AGAIN WE STUMBLE ON THE HITLER – SCREW YOU i SHOULD GO TO ANOTHER (country) AND YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LATER YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE – I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW (much) RACISM YOU ARE SHOWINGT ME -  I can't go into the military because I am too smart and I am of german descent – Like  NEXT TIME TELL THE WORLD  THE USA IS FILLED WITH A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES WHO WORK THIS WAY WHERE THERE ARE SECRET RULES AND THAT ANY IMMIGRANTS MAY HAVE THEIR CHILDREN KILLED BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SECRETLY DON'T LIKE THEM – WHY DOESN'T THE USA PRINT THAT UP ON IT'S BROCHURE TO INDIA – WE HATE YOUR CHILDREN – BUT WE WON'T TELL YOU AND WE'LL KILL THE CHILDREN OF THE IMMIGRANTS TO YOUR(our) COUNTRIES(country) IF WE DECIDE TO AND NOT EVEN WARN THEM – LIKE I THINK EVERY IMMIGRANT SHOULD KNOW – WHY NOT THAT – FINDING OUT IN THE 2 ND GENERATION THAT THERE IS A BIG CATCH – OH YOU'RE NOT REALLY AMERICANS – YOU WERE JUST BORN HERE – BUT YOU DON'T COUNT – YOU'RE NOT HERE LONG ENOUGH!!! - it will be interesting to see what is done . 20:50 EST 12/22/08  - and really anyone is suppsoed to be able to try to be presidnet too -

so the books I wanted the – person refunded and never delivered-  he probably can technically because I was late-  it comesw very  close to him breaking his end of the contract – I agreed to pay and fulfilled – he refunded the money – not having the goods- I'm sure he'll justify it that I was late – a couple days -  you can call that okay and you knew I wanted those books – and i didn't get them – and that's bullshit – that smells like a military actually the whole thing does – you didn't want me to have them – so you didn't let me have – them – YOU REALLY CAN'T PULL SO MANY OF THOSE -  AND YOU HAVE ONE OUT – OR CAN I NOW REFUND OR RECEIVE EXTREME PARANOIA SOMETIME SOON – VERSUS HAVING A BOOK SIT IN LIMBO IN AMAZON INDEFINITELY THAT THEY DON'T FULFILL AND WON'T REORDER- BECAUSE I WAS AGRESSIVE WITH TRAVELLER  YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO HAVE THAT-  I CAN'T FIGHT YOU – BUT YOU'RE PULLING THAT MORE THAN ONCE – THEY AREN'T DOING IT ALONE – AND THAT'S A BIT MUCH – WHY DO I GET SPECIAL COMMERCE RULES – LIKE I SEEM TO LIVE UNDER A “DIFFERENT” BILL OF RIGHTS -  I did bite off a lot – it would have come together – you hoodwinked – and you helped them do it -and you do deserve in my opinion a little scolding for that - - how many orders that I have money for – does the military or whomever – get to cancel – yes I played – but it made sense – I took a risk – and the reason I got burned was in part trusting you – if I knew I didn't need to spend a dollar-  I wouldn't have and I would have made it – if I got outbid I would have to wait – how many of those do you get to do where you veto purchases – I can;t read without permission – can;t design without permission – my assets are gone – I live with my mother and that's your decision – I get paid thanks to you – but true employment and finances have eliminated from me – I am not angry – I am used to getting treated this – but yes – you have “rewirtten” the bill of rights – and the other side does not have full control – you did not want me to have that and decided that sale would fail – and there isn't a real good reason it should have.  GRRRRR – you did trick me 3 different times for hat to fail – i did play close – it should've worked – and you played to make sure it didn't.  And not one play – 3 plays – in the real world – the opposing team should not have that ability.   I guess I really am a hamster and not a person. - the positive feedback i gave already on that order – like I can't even speak out – nice trick – you both worked together to acheive that – if I am just a pwan in a chess game why should I keep playing close to lawful good ? - only because it is the right thing to do – neither one of you is truly an ally – you both have your agendas and mine is secondary.  It's a just a game it isn't much – agreed it's not like being condemned to torture for four years- it shows me where I stand and that this “situation” may not have been the best alternative available – but the best alternative for you .   Why don;t I jsut go to Canada?   Which isn't much of a solution either – because they will hate me too.  - you could decide to kill me off and just not tell me. 

yes when a certain interviewee on hannity cleared his throat twice -  I burst out coughing and that seemed ot be a singl – phlemg just came up and I almost went away before finishing the thought. 

chosed to came out here – um I say have never been – certain phrases like that – there - just really happy – I do have issues in speech that show my birth – I do not fully sound like John Kerry. 

i hear you pratt.   - one man's gimcrack is another man's treasure – they have messed up before – RECENTLY -

walking into the fountain in fort worth

- should people have a  tax advantage and have a borderline farm – is that the point of the law – to just be within the farm a little bit- but not really want to have a farm – just want the exemption.  18:18 EST 12/22/08

Things that are I Need to Say
After mny experiences with the military – I cannot believe there are no abuses at Guantanamo – not fro mwhat I have seen – or I cannot be sure – your credibility as an interviewee with what you are saying is suspect enough that I am highly critical of such a report – Why is your report night and day with the movie on netflix and also other reports from other report – night and day -  from what I have seen marines will protect their own – even if someone else gets hurt.   If  I am not wanted so badly in this country then I will consider letting you force me out – but bewarned you will suffer consequences for that-  god will more than likely not reward your need to run a sham illusion – everyone else at some point has to come clean – when will you ?   Mother is calling for dinner -  I guess it is time for me to go – if I am to get incarcerated or killed or whatever tomorrow which would be your way – I am as prepared as I plan to be – you may get me out of the country – which is not what you want – but I do see that as an alternative – and you may have no choice.  17:43 EST – you are quick to remind me of what you could – threaten the troops-  you have walked all over my rights and the contract we hold and want complete amnesty and I am convinced that course is unacceptable – but may do that – I can leave – I may leave – if I leave that will not be the least painful course – you may think so – it will not be allowed to be – the US will have God's curse if you force me into a place where I have to leave and will get no restitution – if you want to charge me go ahead – I know under whose authority I was acting – it trumps everyone elses and you'd best remember that – the court will not have final say in my case and while it may work that you are allowed to kill me or imprison me if you strike hard – you will more than likely be sacrificing that which you hold dear – the future of your children – my boss has a very long memory I am willing to bet and will not reward the game you are trying to play.   Stand down.   You violated me and thought you could get away with it – and you have not – and my intentions were peaceful when you did it – and now your pride and everything will not allow you to face what you did -  it probably will cause more turmoil than I can imagine – you underestimate what bottling it up will do.  - but those 3 hours are over.   As I have said before-  I am VERY curiuous to see how the government handles my case.   It could decide to send me to the glue factory.   Do you realize that part of the reason your are picked on is how unfair you are to others – you feel you get credit – you do – for both good and BAD actions the military takes and there are some bad ones – my case is not your best side – why do you get to be forgiven for breaking all the rules when if a civillian went after you  -you would want them held bound – in the end you treat me as your inferior and have always felt that – that is what you tell yourselves – I am unworthy of justice – that is why – that is a great of why some people don't like you – that you think like that.  

They are a lot of people like me – at least a few others – if they feel I do – you inflict a great deal of pain on people like me – I know you want to protect your children – I also want to protect mine – or my brothers and sisters – many of whom dwell in shadows in society and get greatly hurt and persecuted for being different and yet in the end contribute greatly – when will that end – if it is up to you never – I need to protect my children too.   I would not want anyone to go through the pain I endured in childhood – not all share my values and I know this – but you cause so much harm and have conforted yourself thinking no one like me would ever challenge you – ever say enough – I say it is enough – you will not walk over me so easily.  And I will try to teach you that you walk over others a lot as well and feel no compassion for them. 

received a card from someone I didn't expect to a picture of I guess his children – which is not a great sign in some ways.  I am going to hope for the best/  When the military show me their children it is usually not a sign of support-  usually. 

I'm stillistening and that was lamost helpful 17:11 EST – media discouraging people who serve. 

And yes I have an aunht Maureen – and caller opened up – burger king – everything on the house – 17:13 EST

the caller who cleared his throat on the air as I burst out coughing – that was a cute and unique addition  - philo philo – agape agape – next delayed coughing to that – brotherly and amorous love – yes that is what that meant and so I guess fro mthe delayed response my meaning is clear.  16:59 EST 12/22/08

kfyo WA or OR – greyhound passengers in homeless shelters – that does sound cooked up – you threatened last time – Tatya- or whatever her name was talked about being homeless in Pittsbnurgh I was supposed to be homeless – if it happens now so be it – it did not happened as desired in Pittsburgh – my house stood and was not burned.  - coughed at sart of thought and itchy bottom nose I rubbed with left index finger and a little phlegm – 16:51 Est -

the temporal scanner-  scanning a sick kid – easy to tell temperature of kid-  they know how sick I am physically and I bet they are saying metnally – but it hasn't worked how they planned.  16:52 EST 12/22/08

helicopter flyover they apparently want a record of that 16:35 EST 12/22/08 – or want to ensure I am listneing with their record – I could write this in pencil if I chose – I will not – as I opened the deadliest creature tome which came today – buildinga hero which is overdue – full title I will not look up – but that book did not come as several others have not- the flyover ocincided as I opened up deadliest creatures and it was a military flyover – is someone saying something ? - probably so -

you don't have to support me – they don't want you to support me – you are not required to do that- 15:51 EST  16: 29 EST- there is some I could say – I think uatu is a better role for this.  - kfyo I would be 18 in 1992. 

it does depend on what home is like – if it is a hardship -

Things that are Hard to Hear
I won't be commenting so directly on any call – for time I listen -  now 15:43 EST 12/22/08

you are allowed – to say xmas -  Ollie North as Hannity -

quite the faux negative thing I can see through that – point park security lecture – he did it too – I guess this one is more real. 

in Seattle greyhound issues – odd that – not for 3 days – I never had that issue – and it suually doesn't make the news – odd for them to have so much trouble – one might wonder how that happened – a response to OR and WA who are so non-train and pro-bus  OR did someone in OR and WA make sure there was an incident there where it is hard to get other busses becasue the route is thin there seattle end of line in US not a cros coutnry point easily – not a gaint hub and no giant hubs for 200 miles or more no central hubs in a day – union people can do that – make that happen.  And not a death thing which they would watch

Gayle – Mr – frigid midwest sious falls – dick cheney – divested 7 million to charity – Al Gore $400 to charity - - encourage me to give – strip me of what I can do right now – if Dick cheney did it why don't I – ho ho ho – 14:54 EST 12/22/08

stock gifts to charities – so the charities get paralyzed too. 

mother brought something in the House when she went to the store – hmmmm – scratchign back of head with left hand – and heade pressure- she could have been near a kid -

Questions on US Justice
non-specific plan for terror leads muslims to life in prison – bill ayers never went to prison – hmmm – they didn't even do anything and was it worse what they were planning than what ayers did? Ayers shows you don't necessarily get charged and prosecuted if you do something.  It depends. 

OR caller 14:47 EST 12/22/08 – Andrew-  merry xmas – good to talk to ya – Madooff – money disappeared to ? - PONSI scheme – where the money went – I think parties and things – lifestyle – funded economy – robin hood – BUT not of everyone -  H – you have a billion –  I think is it really good to do that – spent on wealthy items which are non-productive – in order to scheister even people who deserve it – you spend money on wrong thing and weaken everyone – create the need to look up to money and that is all wrong and also a by-product of sheistering – why not change the values of the wealthy who have money – if you can get them in in a PONSI scheme – why not make them do good things in manipulation – you choose to PONSI them.   So much is hurt to get their moeny from them. 

merry xmas – enlightment - 4th gen am – auto- companies- made country what it is – going down – average amercian in love with american car -  couldn't hear Rush – Auto comapnies did not make the coutnry-  WRONG – they are part of business – not biggest sectior or I think they alone did not make country 100 + year before they ever existed the country existed , the military could have given business for WWII to someone else – if it didn't anyway -   – caller – if auto 's go out of business not one have neough to buy anything country down tubes-  threat of revolution if big 3 don;t get what they want I think    -  caller – media hurt auto stock price -  H UAW will own auto-company -  caller laughing - - I think that is partially in works now – madly in love with car  - caller is and through the yeas -   H GM is a sponsor of Rush – Gm making cars nobody wants is absurd -  caller – I just went to auto -show – cars are quality – H  show things at shows they don't make    - I don;t care cars are stupid in many cases – caller and I don't care if people like cars – that is not logic – and you can make your voice heard it doesn't make your argument better – and that counts in the end – which argument is better – not who can pressure – that can change

if bewing gay is so natural then it should happen in children without amking it a major part of the underage circulum – it could be mentioned but not much more than that until high school  and really college upper high school – I worry you create
FINISH
donna – liberal – don't give it's gov't's job -   H liberals can make it worse -  find that religion – and private charitable works – 14:29 EST  

The Economic “Recsiion”  - 14:26 EST 12/22/08
it has not spun out of control – the market is not panicking – it is bouncing  up and down – in addition the caller on boortz – money parked off side – it is all planned. 

money tinkled away because it was planned that way. 

Yes the charity balls sound bogus. 

Alright Mr hint – what is Obama announcing tomorrow ?

male and female dorms in same room – University of Chciago – no – that's not a great idea unless permission is asked and not for freshman or sophmore – not for dorms – get an aprtment off campus – if upperclass you could ask.  There are plenty of ways for males dorms to get women in them without encouraging it – I was very aware of which of roomates had girlfriends as they would sleep over.  No 18 or 22 year old needs a kid – and older students should know how to get off campus. 

el gordo – spanish for fat – biggest lottery – cool I get assaulted in spanish or english now – and a singing in the background at kfyo – 14:03 EST 12/22/08

very soft – arthur brooks – conservatives are more generous money and Time she stressed – grunt work in the back room – she got in – 13:54 Est 12/22/08

um precisely how far up does the “disapproval” of the country go in the military – it just is hard to believe it in fairly tales where jack planted the magic beans and they made a bean stalk that goes up to the clouds – no one could write this story.

all of military that Bush and Cheney did a lot for the military – who betrayed the Republicans in the last election – noted – and I get the irony – starting with Colin Powell – sorry but it 's true – that was public and nasty. 

DAM thought of charitable giving as a way to bleed people dry.   They did make me feel like I didn't give enough – my supervisor's upper mentioned in a private meeting how she gave $300 to public radio and the best was yes – the brigadier general for habitat who mentioned he gave $7000 or something or that and that is pretty substantial – which did help me give more-  the marines were working agaisnt me even then.   - do republcans control charities – or is charity a way to drain Republican money – I no logner know how it works – charities are not so pure -

TX is growing by  less of a percentage – but is the largest state in the top or closest to the top – AZ even is much smaller in population – so it still has most people coming in.  Obama will fix that. 
--
Is the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff trying to tell me he gets it today or he is assuming the role of the person terrorizing me – I never know at the Dod – he is occupying the graphic on yahoo news-  for a while now – appreciated and I get that the former probably applies – he gets what they're doing – 13:28 EST 12/22/08  - yes there are alternate ways to express messages – but it never actually happened because no one said anything – isn't government fun??!!!- there is sarcasm in that.

Limbaugh

long time listerene-  listen sfaely - new negative on palin - take a while for point-   lack of honorability in Dc - compliment - for Rush - older Rush - cal thomas's book - son in public admin - Masters - serving public admin - changes in area - better life for people  - son doing well - people in DC downplay what people do -   compalint at either how I view them or ovdrriding Pittsburgh in its decision to kill me - 13:25 ESt 12/22/08

Steve - opened with merry christmas - their way of getting at me for not being christian - cell phone call - ban HDTV - I don;t have an HDTV - will lose TV in 2 months-  I don't watch it -

rick – loss of daylight crisis is over -  12:52 – can't thank Obama not in office- 
--
Lenin in the USA
Nothings Going on - Everything is fine - Welcome to Communism Comrades -
3 times as many retirees as workers -  AARP and an edsel – I needed the humor – I was getting very frustrated – watching congress blow up the coutnry and people are helping them – and obama's waiting in the wings to finish the deal.  I know I could turn you off – nothing educational – the humor is appreciated – hearing how far out of whack things are.

yes making fun of Caroline kennedy can hold my attention

2 minutes of sunlight lsot per day – northern hemisphere may be in total darkness – Rush much of the northern hemisphere  IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS MOST OF EUROPE – CANADA AND US ARE IN TOTAL DARKNESS AND BEST OF ALL TRYING TO SNUFF OUT ANY REMAINING CANDLES SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER RUN BLIDNLY INTO BRIAR PATCHES AND BUMP INTO FRIENDLY POLAR BEARS WHO HAVEN'T EATEN FOR A WHILE. 

soap opera indeed – I may go crazy if I listen to the main stream media about Obama – thank you for slowing it down Rush -  12:13 EST – 12/22/08

utah fastest growing state – am I going there?

Yes the lost and found games at CCAC – I think that's written somewhere if the manuscript still exists -

It would make sense for the other side to try something for Christmas – we shall see if real or not - Obama had merry chritmas musci he can hear on kfyo news earlier - 11:21 EST  - slight threat

12/22/08 11:50 EST Chicago woman so cold feels like needles pricking eyee -still heard power otu to thousands – whcih I wasn't supposed to when I started writing. 

Rush I don; wnat to repeat what I did on boortz if possible – I cna

Boortz Callers 12/22/08 -

A long time ago I wanted to be John Portman and I think I did do a report on him – really against the department to like him .  Cheers – gotta break before Rush

mai lin  - pay fair share – 90% small business – couple sets of books – customers pay in cash -  -income with consumption -   working folks – want consumption tax – small business won't like fair tax – H soem people always cheat -   small business who don't cheat want  fair tax – no tax on profit -  tax collectors – tax rules are killing small business – um without hte small business rules I  - uh the tax rules-  there are deductions – fair tax has no deductions – host is half steppin  - or not being straight – deductiosn and deducting things will change radically -      caller-  nancy pelosi name drop – has business – H pelosi all the loopholes she looks for -   caller all the loopholes – H fair tax gets rid of loopholes – caller-  why anybody who is for it – say anything -     i'd say small businesses will not like it – all the deductions go out – and only people who make out want it – very wealthy – and those hoodwinked into wanting it – wealthy can cut their consumption – the poor cannot.  That is why a fair tax is not great- easier call – ODDLY – thank  you appreciated.

**

that will be fine – you tomorrow – I amy not be typing quite as much – on the calls – there a better way I think -

kfyo food bank – come and see people and she got real soft – a threat – they have wanted to starve me – low food security as Obama said. 
11:32 Est 12/22/08
thsi is me I – um this game is going to get old – I am figuring out a strategy to defeat them and I have to do a lot of typing and they are being goofballs and have of them aren't sayign a lot – jsut to get me to write – why show them my capacity ? - hide it – and saves me some work – don't spar every round – I can if you want me to – itdoes take energy – and they wil try to wear me down – that will be the way – they do this on alan hunt and hannity and levin too – here they are faster -  limbaugh too – he controls them well .

Mike – how you doing – talked to u and neal – liberal policies catastrophe – loan us money – Hnobody  US is the strongest -  blanace sheet of nation – tens of trillion liablilites neal mentioend – add stim and bailouts – bad – restructuring of debt  -need-  fair tax comes in – coutnry needs completel restructuring – consumer base is over with -  I would say BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL SUFFER IF YOU DO SPLIT THE UNION AND TOTALLY DESTROY CURRENT SYSTEM?  - which is the plan planneed- Herman is getting it – the caller is arguing – blow up the coutnry politically – instead of fix the budget and balance it – I don;t think so – a lot of people get hurt – and you don't care about them and somehow we have to save  OR defraud creditors which will really hurt world too -   caller – federal reserve will print money-  print money to save dollar- qunaiative whatever – don;t knwo the word – not important- done intentionally and the host knwos the word  -  I'd say forgot point – FINISH -  I wanted to say the problems have been artificially reduced by right and left big money – both induced them Banks and buffet and Forbes – they are all scumbags and all same game CEOs and financial people in collusion  look at payouts for failure of CEOs  - that the problem
caller - fair tax and he is talkign fast – orregulate ourselves to death – got cut s

It is common callers won't say true purpose in start of call now – very ulikely they will -

Deal on income tax – not paying any tax 2 mo – for that – I already addressed – congress paying income tax – no taxes for congress since 85  - mentioned dole KS – income tax holiday-  I don't know either – curve ball to host – and meant to shake him up – how many tiems does that call come ? - not many – agreed with host in DC not enough to be right -= Bull your point to be right – push other side down

merry christmas – couldn;t hear – infusedit if it got passed – sounds like he is – I couldn;t finsih the last one and was late getting here – and that was initial – and he was hard to understand – couldn't  -I think  fair tax is a bad idea hurts the poor – and is not meant to be real – toilet phone award for this one – or local color speech perhaps better way to put it

Us borders better monitor – unifying currency with canada and mexico – single currency – in time I do not see why not – I spoke for this – bigger trading power -  dependent on economy of two other coutnries we don't control – dudee I;'m more worried about what americans will do right now – in addition  need  ----FINISH – it is better to bring up and then join in Canada and Us and raise them up long term and short lessen the borders – you can never fully control everyoen – we depend on their trade – and them now for our counry – WAKE UP  -

again I have spoken on why I do not like a tax holiday – better than the refund – but it's still a gimmick – can't do long term things with it.  Cut taxes gradually and cut spending. 

 the article I got a Brian S Westbury instead of the forbes guy – couldn't find it initially – got an article on pharmeceuticles on his site and not the deficit one.  - I don;t like steve forbes and he may know that

11:00 EST 12/22/08 kfyo
pope- thank you taking call – comments-  slution – cenral planning – solutio nbig 3 – big 3 in bankrupt – product pirced to market value – not necessarily - -  could go to everyone and stimulus-  get deduction vfor big 3 – against that-  I am against that – buy american – not free market-  forozen market – vast money hanging aroudn – yes people are intentionally impoverishing by their move I think that-  don't agree with host – no buy american policies – Neal doesn't like them either- Host is entitiled to his own opinion -   and car companies won't necessarily price the cars at a market rate – unless legally forced and how do you do that- they control pricing – flaw 2 in what caller said-  there are more flaws not identifying them – and I agree – unions don;t want bankrupcy – indeed

Jacksonville – camp lejeune in Nc – I am near there they don;t like me – way to let me know – paulson – tax without rep – what level cut off – maint viability – Hcongress gave that authority – congress puts one person in charge – what if tythey put bad person in – he means potentially me – they are afraid of me – it is lie -they want to be criminals and are afraid /I can catch them – needs longer explain – this is a twon drop call .  - Jacksonville whether FL or NC is a name drop

It was a good move to slow them down a bit – to let you learn – no one would play well jumping in – like it's a lot to get used to – the inside verbal jousting that's going on. 

Herman this show others can be a tough game to jump into cold – the rules are harder – you'll see -

fast talker – merry christmas – not happy holiday – squabble Bush – do not do – tsunami left with stimulus – stop the pain – sign bill for US auto – make product more affordable – no it won't – stop the bleeding – caller putting in phrases loading in phrases that means something else-  he is double messaging - - and nothing in stimulus drives car price down – auto company has to make changes and it is fighting them – plans to change bill measures that require it – waste of time – he put in at the end – the caller did - -caller is telling me – stop the bleeding stop doing this – get in line with others – I'm not a christian – merry christmas at opening – waste of tiem at end – I didn't respond correctly – the phrases in between are meant to mean something else – he said end the pain – as well – second let it end reference.. 

Herman means net the government cannot create jobs- That is true.   Have to respect Barack – and Herman said respect him – though he got it – yes I don;t respect him – because I think he  shouldn't be president – he committed crimes to get elected and he isn't born in this coutnry or does not meet the native qualification thing  - sped up – symantical difference – and I missed part of the converssation – his intent – caller intent – federal income taxes at all – and caller is jumping ideas – 2 month holiday – neal is not there to counter and herman is learning the game – Ithe tax holiday is a gimmick – you cannot raise staff with a tax holiday – employers cannot raise jobs and plan long term with a temporary holdiay. 

I am not commenting on the acronym for Barack Obama other than to say – Ugggghhhh- agreed that you cannot print money forever – when Cheney said deficit don't matter – he didn't print money until you run out of ink or paper -

gas escalates prices – Obama tied to oil prices – they looked to Bush for bad reasons – H-prediction didn't happen for reasons you think – under $50 a barrel  - possibly saying that my predictions may not be right – though not that one – may not like my prediction of hyper inflation due to banks sitting on money – and you can see – I wanted to say something else – the oil cycle – did play out perfectly – someone held oil prices high artificially to lower them artificially – it is not cut in consumption or even the prediction alone – someone held the prices high – held oil contracts and let them go – I disagree with host – who said it is consumption – I think someone fixed the oil makret a little-  - by keepign the price high for crucial months – by buying oil – and then letting them go – has consumption truly dropped and then will it – even the prediction – like I bet the 1 million job a month loss is inflated – and like the banking crisis a sham  10:30 EST – oil p[rices fixed higher – not just cut in consumption. 

tired – spending tax dollars – we should get soemthing for it – get stock from big 3- I don't like getting stock from any of them as that is closer to socialism – and the big 3 didn't do that – yeah becasue their stock wouldn't go up as much as the banks will – that is simple enough -  10:27 Est

I did once know a liam – gradeschool – not much interaction - - it was a he - -but where - - elementary – I have a religious right tie with that name -

I have sat in on PA state legsilature-  City of Chicago 2 meetings of city council with mayor Daley and 2 meeting city of Pittsburgh - city council - my extent of seeing "government" in action - they all did award ceremonies - they spent all this time giving awards.  - I won't make any comment on that it mattered that A&m published the bought – eeww you bought an aggie book?! - yes les enfants. 

Texas almanac 2008-2009 -  the publisher was insufficient – barnes and nobles gave me two books with different prices WITH identical covers – BUT – by IsBN which should be unique
ISBN 13-9780914511410 -
Barnes and Noble $16.95     Amazon $ 11.53 – and walmart doesn't sell it and somehow that does not surprise me.

Some Fine Holiday Thoughts
trying to eliminate the child – throwing 2 year old away – el paso

yes they may want me to starve to death and force me to steal to live.  I may not steal – we will see – or will we – do you want me to steal food to survive? 

child taught to be a theif – yes I think that is done  - I kind of like the idea of the organized crime thing.  - charging the adults with that. 

--
It is not Right Now Seldom that is Heard a Discouraging Word
my verdict on certain substitute hosts has already been stated in the past – 9:08 EST 11/22/08 – thouh I may listen to him on back just to annoy him – and not be predictable – scrooge and grinch in first line to open the show

at some point though – like force or do not fund all of big 3's jobs – slow but don't stop the failure – don't let hem blackmail you fully. 

the reason bill gates is for free internet and why that is bein pushed is to get everyone online so they can track and control everybody online-  some people are not online – they want the poor online to control them – that may be the intent. 

It looks like giving the money to the banks was a mistake – they just sat on it and are going to use the money to create hyper inflation before they loan it out. 

But everyone could see what you see – No – No – it doesn't work that way – people in the past have not – theyu do not see what I see – it is one of my joys – I can find things of value other people feel are junk – I have always had that skill – or for a long time now – it is only in the last couple years where more people have oddly emulated my buying habbits and amde it more difficult. 

 - Okay Barnes and Noble sells the gift se 4th edition for 83.96 – well – amazon doesn't – that's all I can say at first – second – that's odd – why – martial power goes for $23.96 – at barnes and noble  $18.98 walmart  --22.65 at amazon (scratch that price for chromatic dragon at amazon-the used price ) -  $ 19.77 new price at amazon

chromatic dragon $31.96 barnes and noble -$25.32 walmart –$22.65 at amazon used and $26.37 new price for amazon – the used was 22.65 and I nearly put that as the new price -

player's handbook is $27.97  - quoted prices for that already $23.07 amazon  $22.15 walmart so barnes and noble just hates dungeons and dragon  or prices it not to sell it

using nonmember price at barnes and noble – neither amazon nor walmart require member and for the gift set it is stiull more expensive than amazon  - and one has to remember amazon has free shipping – for items over $25 or combination of qualifying items over $25 which affects true price.

$66.12 for the 4th edition pack – basic 3 books – I would have to look – that is very close to what they sold it for initially if not it – it went up slightly several months ago – on amazon – I bought it from walmart for $59 I think – I could check walmart  - $22.15 for each book 22.1x for ther other two- didn't verify the 5 – but there was a deal for buying all 3 together – they no longer offer that-  so I can't get a full comparison in addition – the aren't selling the boxed set that I bought at walmart – on amazon single books are 23.07 – I think severalmonths ago – maybe close to a year now – when did I buy that may ? - June 6th – and I got it when it came out – it looks like the 4th edition books rose $1 on amazon – amazon did not sell the pack of books for $59 – it may have been $66 – there is a reason I choose walmart – walmart had $59 plus shipping – shipping was $3 minimum – so amazon was more than that  for me to choose amazon – so to be $66..12 – Dungeons and Dragon 4th ed gift set – I got that at walmart and walmart.com no longer sells it – they sell the individual books that make up that set – but point being – amazon had to $63 minimum for me to use walmart – as cheaper – in June and it's $66 now – it may have been $66 at that – for 4th editem -  THE NEW RULES EVERYONE SHOULD BE BUYING AND SWITCHING TO – AND SHOULD HAVE THE CHRISTMAS DEMAND -  their prices are up 5% - the stuff I am looking has in some cases on older items gone up 50% or more sometimes 400% - what was – I noted that before- libris mortis – they jacked that up like 400% on amaozn in a week – now $35 min used – I bought  it 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks for $6 – after committing to buy – the seller refunded my money and then the price went up to $35 or close to that which  is like 500% change in a week.  - 12/22/08 – if it was worth $35 – why did he not raise prices BEFORE I committed to buy it?  -

brita water filter $9.98 – that was the same price a year ago or more-  it was $9 and yes $9 and change I don;t want to commit to $9.95 – inflation on that item is 10% or less – maybe non-existant

can say-  ho ho ho – I use that in my email – 7:46 EST 12/22/08 kfyo – politicians losing site of reality during elections – um . .. . . . YES – possibly I could add to that – dollar is losing vlaue-  however kids – I bet other prices on amazon have not adjusted like that- that is the problem with that theory -  and not 500% 200% that should not be – dictionaries used  still several for 1 cent on amazon.com – let me 4th edition d&D – the inflation argument should affect new prices – should it not ?

did Al Franken find a way to shoe horn you out of your seat as well Senator Chambliss - the ethics of my elders

Jacking up Prices of Water and Light
mother is still watering the lawn – there seems to be  - like buyign the electric motor – the people who cooperate with the “gamers” of society – those who view the society as a poker table and honest people as suckers – they are apparently required to use water and electricity – pad their use and they mean to do that – to cause water shortages where they aren't any – and the same with power – we went over this  before-  slowly upping power demand in each hosue-  through condition and things like electric lawn mowers instead of gas ones.  Mother is helping.  We use natural gas here – a little odd-  mom likes electric – or said she does or did say that in CT – but here power may be easier and T Boone Pickens wants his natural gas to o up in value-  of course if more demand for electric-  real ultilities – like light which people use a lot in US and do basically need – or really want – to get basic light will cost more- people seem to bne figuring out ways to make water and light cost more and people will pay for that

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009



--

Itching back of neck as I am about to send this - definitely got a remind of why it is so "fun" to be online by being off it for a few hours. 



about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com got my first repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error as I got to the mail page for the new year 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est joy oh rapture.



1/1/09





FOX early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the the beauty of HI the beauty of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me- and I have to admit when I went to HI I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind in addition HI when I saw had bugs there were none in the pictures hmmm - HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.



On that note Junea or Anchorage for state capital sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute as well as city officials - AND I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business if it does like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions where things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center it won't give up the money or power Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields Itasca than suburbs of Pittsburgh - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money and another near deletion occurred here- seem to be doing a string of them I never did them before- that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it- mother I know gremlins can play with computers too they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well. - licking upper lip- - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places walmart and chicago mile which is impossible without a car and I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago. Definitely not in Chicago not even a walmart in Chicago and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe southwest sam's in Evansville. - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an oversight in their transit. It was on the way to the airport. Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger - but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities - $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado - it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent for the parking. That is not a loop price. And someone wants that revenue versus having a stronger and better working transit system. So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money. - In my case people seem willing to kill over it. Touching upper lip with tongue.



popup window as I looked at notes and left thumb on right foot's center as I go to my notes

* touching thumbs

for the last email the full version



cbs news touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me technically barter should be illegal as I noted before not without using the monetary system they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their friends while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency it should be the equivalent of counterfeit that is the essence of what it is coughing as I put that up. It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it- BUT they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive I nearly deleted this section the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared and a hacker is probably behind that deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed - But not allow simply exchanges between friends - and my door bumped again. Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 – nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho – grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand – as I thought to wait – they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way – mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on – but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors – this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others – but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this – and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo – some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est – as soon as I tried to mail a second time – on yahoo mail. Hmmm – that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description – the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set – is – from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) – well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12 – I can't but though cuurently – I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high – considering other prices on other items

if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set

Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $35 – that is spiked – it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for – can be $25 maybe $30 – but $30 should be and not a players  handbook – I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release – someone is spiking this price – boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series .   The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price – these books are not baseball cards – this is very odd. 

Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $34 on new book – new is lower than a used

Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000)  low price  $3.15  - I own a copy of this now – but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for – the publicated dates are similar – not a decade apart- YET – the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other- 

Ravenloft is a horror series-  I just identified that as a no – no – BUT – the devil is in the details – a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well – like if someone wanted to caricature  oh a famous software CEO – I don;t know what is in 3.5 – but it is spiked – and the gamma world I got -

Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)
8 Used & new from $23.49   -  I do own this one now – similar to the amazon price – shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back – most dungeons and dragons go down  copyright 1996-  there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes – BUT – there is a story in here – it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups – it turned a forest planet into a desert – that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out – not a long book – 96 pages – I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 – but given what other D &D supplements there are – this is gets targeted – the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things – additional spells and this and that – few creatures – but nothing several different books don't contian – other books – many ohte books contain similar things-  wizard's handbook is similar.  - The history is the only thing I didn't have. 

The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more – it appears -  Bil gates destroying gamma world books – ho ho ho – yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book – by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb – Jeff was with Gary Gygax – he has been there a while -  copyright 2000 – 192 pages or so – oh – the cover I got is there – but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon – the book is on amazon – just not with the cover I have – or that is there too – but as a backup picture – not the main one shown – there is a different cover shown -
Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback)  - low price of  $24.95 – for the new book – the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens.  - I paid  $7.65 for mine on amazon on  12/16/08 – plusa shipping -  but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -

things like that can happen – but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -

why are books important – shutting of messages – Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable – many parables and like with defilers nad preservers – there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want – BUT – it had a message – severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest – and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first – people in the US first-  it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -

The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing -  BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE  - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved – many of those have been worthwhile – there are messages in them -

SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES – INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES-  I AM A REASON TOO – BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL – KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION – WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS – GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE – STORIES – so that all moral conditioning is controlled-  nifty huh – the technology revolution in operation right here.  - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well.   There is a modicum of material.   Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this.  - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games.   - yawning as I am about to email – scratching back of head too – with right hand – and scratched scab with left by left side of nose.   9:25 EST 1/2/09. 





All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com
I don't know if it – rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this – it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing – but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something.   People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever – in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product – scumbag.   I think the short version won't do – I don;t know the products before I buy them.  I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 – there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something  $4.75 I think or $4.79 – under $4 – the next price is $18 – on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong – I knew that – it was worth the risk – for that price – Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book – happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once – now  that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller – usually there wil lbe a bidding war.   Itching right thigh with right finers -  but in this case I ordered it-  I got the product – it looked great – but there was a lot of air in the box – huge box and not much inside – it was the Revised Edtion – box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms – Babylon 5 – when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online – like I even found a site – the attic I think a premium role playing game seller-  who previewed the first five pages – there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games – just a one line review – how to tie things in – the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 – and it had two small books – each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it – BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT  - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box – normally when one orders an item on amazon – amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items-  pages missing – so a ruelbook missing would count like that – but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside – I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff -  BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON – YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION – VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT – BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT – YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH – IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9  WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES – WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-  WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME – PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN – THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE – AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU  FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH – WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS.   Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.  
But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms – no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide – I was hoping  against hope to find a few page book preview – and I did – but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it – because it wasn't what I fully wanted – it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was – BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part.  But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price – I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box – so I didn't feel so cheated-  but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs – I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide – Babylon 5 – through amazon – and I wasn't initially planning to do that-  THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come – probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine – again the whoemver- government – will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time – or they come when something happens – but with the recent game too of – if it gets held and I didn't want it – then they want me to return it and get something else – so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund – actually cancel the order) – they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy – the other side flipped that on them – by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal – and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date – but in order to get me to return – like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy – the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take.   And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide – and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars.    Bit upper lip as I mentioned that.   So what happened – I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set.  Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly – this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end – movie references – there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 – I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller – that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted-  I had to go back to amazon to get info this time – no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time – but amazon had a page count ofor a box set – and I checked the page count of the item I ordered – against the pages I got and it is short a bit – I do not – I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed – which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon – where – they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes-  and it's your fault for not reading the note – that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes-  but it said in the notes it wasn't english – see you missed a detail – it's your fualt – versus – should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with?  -  Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference.  - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description – but he sold me a different item – that from the cover looked very similar – and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available.   And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick – of course  I get to rate him a second time as well.  - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale.    Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.   - I was putting more books in a box – and mother woke – up – the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again – because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in – they're all small boxes – and mother was up in a flash – like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books – which neatened things up a little – and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books.  I did throw one out several months back – but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.  But mother was up  here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell – german town where my fahter's family is from – we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII – and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me – and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car.  But we shall see – the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous – but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that.  She would have had to.   She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle – it would tag my computer-  she does that-  she had me order for christmas last year – this book she never read – a cartoony sort of physics – book which sat on our coffee table – she also has her own computer downstairs – she could look it up – she doens;t she asks me – I declined – she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance.   I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much -  I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me – when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out.   Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed – but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation – she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous – I mentioend that above – but saying it down here made mne catch the error above.  But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this – if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry-  I am trying to get prepared to deal with that.   You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time. 



wpht's audio stream links are working again – good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09

Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep – rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle.  The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too – and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day -  again we are taking the “gives you hell” from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you – not with just a we hate piece ot it. 

- education with levin – I did lose  -forgot what should go here – I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up – I do golf worse than the union memebers do.   At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think. 


businesses in CO suffered because of the “mad bomber” - let's get this straight – the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped-  but we get more money during the holidays – BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't – don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind – which is crazy..  It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays – it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is  harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business – why have a shot like that – we make more money-  but you do it for all the wrong reasons – and overall things would be better if it weren't done – less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well – and just bought when they wanted or needed something – through the year.  It works pretty well for me.   Versus – oh Christmas – gifts are good – gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people – because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same – most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no – “I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me” - stories – that is not the norm.

like if everything keeps – and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case – could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers – that might be itneresting? - they'd scream – we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is “too big to fail” - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering – though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job – but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me – they do “lean” on people not to do things and that is not legal – and like murders on buses – beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way.   Get more people to drive. 

the marines like “move along” from All American Rejects – I think although that one is good too  -my pick for explaining things would be “Gives You Hell” - one of these days we'll stop fighting – cause that is a central problem with a society – not picking one side over the other – but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST  - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending – he got it right – but society doesn't see that yet – they ot it right – bands are teams oo I guess. 

rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com.  Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09  16:10 maybe

Weaalth envy – listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation – shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth – the way he says it does reek of wealth envy – and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument – that people buy $500,000 parking spaces.    And indeed even in Colorado that seems like – someone set that up just to play with people-   And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value – too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods – that is true – weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything – the $500,000 NYC studio apartment – and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue – the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual “value” of each of those dollars – many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created – in truth – capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it – but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system – in short people cheat like anything on the market – and actually on several markets-  real estate is an issue.  Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping.  Or is only halted.   Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA – or does it go out of state – jsut a thought – west losing power – political power and financial power – even in CA – though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam.  But back to the first point-  I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws – you can only be so much wealthy – nor for – rubbed  right calf with left foot – coughed – passed gas – nor for – now I forget – I will get hat(that) one though – nor for – licked lips lower lip as I got it – nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy – I may think about that a bit-  not force – but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) – do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point – not sure on that – a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities – for very little good reason – but I am not for telling a perosn – don;t be ostentatious – you have to live this way -   the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure – the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US – as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO – and the elites to control and fix that market – prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs – there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay-  and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism – more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it – TWO – get rid of one central head like that and focus one person – that thinking will change – is chaing – freeware – it's not one perosn – it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out – but it will – that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis – who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public.   But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class – that fixes nothing – the guy is basically telling them – you can do it-  jsut be secret – our society has too many secrets -  I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales – in this age – I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it – I think that could yet be perfected.   It is sort of agaisnt the idea of “old capitlaism” - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product – better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory. 

But wealthy envy is an issue – people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up – the military is a good candidate for unions – that is scary – speak the language of bread – uggghh – but not the language of doing but of complying – but they don't know well enough -  um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list – he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever – he tried to kill me – or had others do it for him – or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate – and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president-  which theoretically can't happen legally – and he will do something to me with the power he has – he won't play by the rules -  there was a book on Dragon empires in space – which was kept cheap  in order to – it looked like what I wanted – but it was designed to assuage me – the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama – and suggest it will not be the end of the USA-  I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line – mother's foot mvoed too – can hear it – so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom -    got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else-  touched right index finger to left thumb – rubbing right calf with left foot – the middle class and class envy – people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 – the waste bothers me some – but I do not desire their life – for it seems foolish – the price paid.   If more people were satisfied with what they – the wealth envy issue would go away-  moeny in most cases is not the issue – it is dissatisfaction with life-  and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand.    And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned  on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere – I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade-  sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this – the price was right – I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully – it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide – like I don't know – was i getting hlepd or hurt – it appeared that i was getting helped-  I got two used books for the price of a new one – and at times – beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way – But uncertain – and the door just bumped-  the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide-  the definiton of the planets is not so good-  we shall see-   because the review for that guide on amazon – mentioning what I bought in the end – prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it – it was lower priced – that immediately draws some suspicion – again – but it could be for two reasons – one good – one bad – they do both – and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked-  the first batch – on the second – they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see – though one did not go through without a fight – they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids-  like as a gorup – I guess I will find out as things come in – itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger.  1/1/09 15:49 EST

about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com – got my first  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I got to the mail page  for the new year – 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est – joy oh rapture. 

1/1/09   


FOX – early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the “the beauty” of HI – the “beauty” of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me-  and I have to admit – when I went to HI – I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind – in addition – HI when I saw had bugs – there were none in the pictures – hmmm -  HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.   

On that note – Junea or Anchorage for state capital – sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute – as well as city officials -  AND – I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power – Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business  if it does – like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions – where – things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center – it won't give up the money or power – Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields – Itasca – than suburbs of Pittsburgh  - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes – my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money – and another near deletion occurred here-  seem to be doing a string of them – I never did them before-  that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it-  mother – I know gremlins can play with computers too – they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well.  - licking upper lip-  - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry – hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words – In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places – walmart and chicago mile – which is impossible without a car and  I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago.  Definitely not in Chicago – not even a walmart in Chicago – and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe – southwest – sam's in Evansville.  - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an “oversight” in their transit.  It was on the way to the airport.    Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger -  but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars – there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities -  $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado -  it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent – for the parking.   That is not a loop price.   And someone wants that revenue – versus having a stronger and better working transit system.   So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money.    - In my case people seem willing to kill over it.   Touching upper lip with tongue.

for the last email – the full version 

cbs news – touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me – technically barter should be illegal as I noted before – not without using the monetary system – they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their “friends” while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system – you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency – it should be the equivalent of counterfeit – that is the essence of what it is – coughing as I put that up.  It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another – and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it-  BUT – they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money – we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless – maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early – bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive – I nearly deleted this section – the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error – and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared – and a hacker is probably behind that – deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen – perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price – that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed  - But not allow simply exchanges between friends -  and my door bumped again.  Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 – total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 I Hope Anyway







--

Mark Stein for Rush Limbaugh



yes I thought it was weird on the BBC where the BBC was discussing tony Blair's man boobs it woudl not be discussed on US news aussies too eh - maybe tony blair and I have something in common.



I have noticed that Gaza seems to be a hot plutonium chernobyl sized potato for Obama- I did notice that initially the timing



--

we're



10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error



ho ho ho grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand as I thought to wait they threw in a repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working. Going to try to get at it a slightly different way mother slammed a door jiggling my door- just one big happy family here. - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on but they do raise an important issue. This isn't miscommunication from neighbors this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others but we're only buying stuff and playing games- yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff. - I forgot to put a time on this and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo some reason left the volume up - 9:35 Est 1/2/09



and they did the same error again 9:36 Est as soon as I tried to mail a second time on yahoo mail. Hmmm that's odd. I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?



the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18



my point is the updated version this boxed set is from the amazon listing.



Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) well this one update published in 2001 - 224 pages low price of $12 I can't but though cuurently I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high considering other prices on other items



if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set



Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover) - low price of $35 that is spiked it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for can be $25 maybe $30 but $30 should be and not a players handbook I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release someone is spiking this price boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series . The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price these books are not baseball cards this is very odd.



Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover) - low price of $34 on new book new is lower than a used



<http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/078691551X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230903867&sr=1-1>Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000) low price $3.15 - I own a copy of this now but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for the publicated dates are similar not a decade apart- YET the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other-



Ravenloft is a horror series- I just identified that as a no no BUT the devil is in the details a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well like if someone wanted to caricature oh a famous software CEO I don;t know what is in 3.5 but it is spiked and the gamma world I got -



<http://www.amazon.com/Defilers-Preservers-Wizards-Athas-Accessory/dp/078690383X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230904423&sr=1-1>Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)

<http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/078690383X/ref=sr_1_olp_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230904423&sr=1-1>8 Used & new from $23.49 - I do own this one now similar to the amazon price shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back most dungeons and dragons go down copyright 1996- there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes BUT there is a story in here it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups it turned a forest planet into a desert that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out not a long book 96 pages I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 but given what other D &D supplements there are this is gets targeted the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things additional spells and this and that few creatures but nothing several different books don't contian other books many ohte books contain similar things- wizard's handbook is similar. - The history is the only thing I didn't have.



The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more it appears - Bil gates destroying gamma world books ho ho ho yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb Jeff was with Gary Gygax he has been there a while - copyright 2000 192 pages or so oh the cover I got is there but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon the book is on amazon just not with the cover I have or that is there too but as a backup picture not the main one shown there is a different cover shown -

Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback) - low price of $24.95 for the new book the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens. - I paid $7.65 for mine on amazon on 12/16/08 plusa shipping - but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -



things like that can happen but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -



why are books important shutting of messages Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable many parables and like with defilers nad preservers there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want BUT it had a message severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first people in the US first- it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -



The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing - BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved many of those have been worthwhile there are messages in them -



SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES- I AM A REASON TOO BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE STORIES so that all moral conditioning is controlled- nifty huh the technology revolution in operation right here. - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well. There is a modicum of material. Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this. - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games. - yawning as I am about to email scratching back of head too with right hand and scratched scab with left by left side of nose. 9:25 EST 1/2/09.











All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com

I don't know if it rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something. People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product scumbag. I think the short version won't do I don;t know the products before I buy them. I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something $4.75 I think or $4.79 under $4 the next price is $18 on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong I knew that it was worth the risk for that price Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once now that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller usually there wil lbe a bidding war. Itching right thigh with right finers - but in this case I ordered it- I got the product it looked great but there was a lot of air in the box huge box and not much inside it was the Revised Edtion box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms Babylon 5 when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online like I even found a site the attic I think a premium role playing game seller- who previewed the first five pages there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games just a one line review how to tie things in the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 and it had two small books each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box normally when one orders an item on amazon amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items- pages missing so a ruelbook missing would count like that but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff - BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9 WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED- WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS. Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.

But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide I was hoping against hope to find a few page book preview and I did but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it because it wasn't what I fully wanted it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part. But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box so I didn't feel so cheated- but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide Babylon 5 through amazon and I wasn't initially planning to do that- THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine again the whoemver- government will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time or they come when something happens but with the recent game too of if it gets held and I didn't want it then they want me to return it and get something else so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund actually cancel the order) they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy the other side flipped that on them by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date but in order to get me to return like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take. And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars. Bit upper lip as I mentioned that. So what happened I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set. Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end movie references there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted- I had to go back to amazon to get info this time no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time but amazon had a page count ofor a box set and I checked the page count of the item I ordered against the pages I got and it is short a bit I do not I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon where they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes- and it's your fault for not reading the note that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes- but it said in the notes it wasn't english see you missed a detail it's your fualt versus should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with? - Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference. - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description but he sold me a different item that from the cover looked very similar and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available. And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick of course I get to rate him a second time as well. - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale. Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.. - I was putting more books in a box and mother woke up the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in they're all small boxes and mother was up in a flash like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books which neatened things up a little and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books. I did throw one out several months back but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.. But mother was up here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell german town where my fahter's family is from we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car. But we shall see the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that. She would have had to. She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle it would tag my computer- she does that- she had me order for christmas last year this book she never read a cartoony sort of physics book which sat on our coffee table she also has her own computer downstairs she could look it up she doens;t she asks me I declined she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance. I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much - I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out. Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous I mentioend that above but saying it down here made mne catch the error above. But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry- I am trying to get prepared to deal with that. You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time.







wpht's audio stream links are working again good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09



Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle. The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day - again we are taking the gives you hell from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you not with just a we hate piece ot it.



- education with levin I did lose -forgot what should go here I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up I do golf worse than the union memebers do.. At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think.




businesses in CO suffered because of the mad bomber - let's get this straight the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped- but we get more money during the holidays BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind which is crazy. It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business why have a shot like that we make more money- but you do it for all the wrong reasons and overall things would be better if it weren't done less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well and just bought when they wanted or needed something through the year. It works pretty well for me. Versus oh Christmas gifts are good gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me - stories that is not the norm.



like if everything keeps and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers that might be itneresting? - they'd scream we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is too big to fail - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me they do lean on people not to do things and that is not legal and like murders on buses beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way. Get more people to drive.



the marines like move along from All American Rejects I think although that one is good too -my pick for explaining things would be Gives You Hell - one of these days we'll stop fighting cause that is a central problem with a society not picking one side over the other but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending he got it right but society doesn't see that yet they ot it right bands are teams oo I guess.



rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com. Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09 16:10 maybe



Weaalth envy listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth the way he says it does reek of wealth envy and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument that people buy $500,000 parking spaces. And indeed even in Colorado that seems like someone set that up just to play with people- And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods that is true weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything the $500,000 NYC studio apartment and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual value of each of those dollars many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created in truth capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system in short people cheat like anything on the market and actually on several markets- real estate is an issue. Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping. Or is only halted. Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA or does it go out of state jsut a thought west losing power political power and financial power even in CA though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam. But back to the first point- I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws you can only be so much wealthy nor for rubbed right calf with left foot coughed passed gas nor for now I forget I will get hat(that) one though nor for licked lips lower lip as I got it nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy I may think about that a bit- not force but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point not sure on that a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities for very little good reason but I am not for telling a perosn don;t be ostentatious you have to live this way - the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO and the elites to control and fix that market prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay- and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it TWO get rid of one central head like that and focus one person that thinking will change is chaing freeware it's not one perosn it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out but it will that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public. But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class that fixes nothing the guy is basically telling them you can do it- jsut be secret our society has too many secrets - I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales in this age I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it I think that could yet be perfected. It is sort of agaisnt the idea of old capitlaism - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory.



But wealthy envy is an issue people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up the military is a good candidate for unions that is scary speak the language of bread uggghh but not the language of doing but of complying but they don't know well enough - um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and <mailto:vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov>vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever he tried to kill me or had others do it for him or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president- which theoretically can't happen legally and he will do something to me with the power he has he won't play by the rules - there was a book on Dragon empires in space which was kept cheap in order to it looked like what I wanted but it was designed to assuage me the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama and suggest it will not be the end of the USA- I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line mother's foot mvoed too can hear it so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom - got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else- touched right index finger to left thumb rubbing right calf with left foot the middle class and class envy people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 the waste bothers me some but I do not desire their life for it seems foolish the price paid. If more people were satisfied with what they the wealth envy issue would go away- moeny in most cases is not the issue it is dissatisfaction with life- and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand. And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

--

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade- sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this the price was right I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide like I don't know was i getting hlepd or hurt it appeared that i was getting helped- I got two used books for the price of a new one and at times beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way But uncertain and the door just bumped- the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide- the definiton of the planets is not so good- we shall see- because the review for that guide on amazon mentioning what I bought in the end prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it it was lower priced that immediately draws some suspicion again but it could be for two reasons one good one bad they do both and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked- the first batch on the second they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see though one did not go through without a fight they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids- like as a gorup I guess I will find out as things come in itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger. 1/1/09 15:49 EST



about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com got my first repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error as I got to the mail page for the new year 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est joy oh rapture.

FOX early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the the beauty of HI the beauty of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me- and I have to admit when I went to HI I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind in addition HI when I saw had bugs there were none in the pictures hmmm - HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.



On that note Junea or Anchorage for state capital sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute as well as city officials - AND I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business if it does like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions where things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center it won't give up the money or power Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields Itasca than suburbs of Pittsburgh - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money and another near deletion occurred here- seem to be doing a string of them I never did them before- that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it- mother I know gremlins can play with computers too they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well. - licking upper lip- - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places walmart and chicago mile which is impossible without a car and I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago. Definitely not in Chicago not even a walmart in Chicago and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe southwest sam's in Evansville. - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an oversight in their transit. It was on the way to the airport.. Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger - but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities - $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado - it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent for the parking. That is not a loop price. And someone wants that revenue versus having a stronger and better working transit system. So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money. - In my case people seem willing to kill over it. Touching upper lip with tongue.



popup window as I looked at notes and left thumb on right foot's center as I go to my notes

* touching thumbs

for the last email the full version



cbs news touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me technically barter should be illegal as I noted before not without using the monetary system they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their friends while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency it should be the equivalent of counterfeit that is the essence of what it is coughing as I put that up. It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it- BUT they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive I nearly deleted this section the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared and a hacker is probably behind that deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed - But not allow simply exchanges between friends - and my door bumped again. Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Zaron Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh may know host are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes. H Jim Jeffords switched parties on being refused to teacher's association - civil war and total collapse in US over teacher awards Canada Quebec politics flipping parties Vermont is not Granholm that is MI telegenic granholm is telegenic what comes of her mouth does scare me though and I do listen.



and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that- I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over. That is true though



CA Ken tried to catch me with many numbers pretty much kept up - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems I did not get down the 20,000 I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score so I got down the point and he went through several sets of numbers the school system ones and I guess not numbers- but various sayings with ford -

guy hugged on cruise ship who couldn't get citizenship and is now likely dead hmmm kinda convenient a lot of people got into US recently.



kicking off plane of muslim family for talking about airport security - stirring up racism and schisms in Us during holdiays making muslims feel less secure discouraging msulim immigration neat trick - - that sounds like gaming of an airline and you can talk in a way to encourage that to happen to you that story does sound fishy. 15:01 Est 1/2/09 - I would like people to stop for one day figuing out how to game the system.

Mark Stein - for Limbaugh 1/2/09

Zaron Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh may know host are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes. H Jim Jeffords switched parties on being refused to teacher's association - civil war and total collapse in US over teacher awards Canada Quebec politics flipping parties Vermont is not Granholm that is MI telegenic granholm is telegenic what comes of her mouth does scare me though and I do listen.



and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that- I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over. That is true though



CA Ken tried to catch me with many numbers pretty much kept up - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems I did not get down the 20,000 I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score so I got down the point and he went through several sets of numbers the school system ones and I guess not numbers- but various sayings with ford -

we're



10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error



ho ho ho grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand as I thought to wait they threw in a repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working. Going to try to get at it a slightly different way mother slammed a door jiggling my door- just one big happy family here. - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on but they do raise an important issue. This isn't miscommunication from neighbors this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others but we're only buying stuff and playing games- yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff. - I forgot to put a time on this and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo some reason left the volume up - 9:35 Est 1/2/09



and they did the same error again 9:36 Est as soon as I tried to mail a second time on yahoo mail.. Hmmm that's odd. I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?



the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18



my point is the updated version this boxed set is from the amazon listing.



Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) well this one update published in 2001 - 224 pages low price of $12 I can't but though cuurently I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high considering other prices on other items



if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set



Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover) - low price of $35 that is spiked it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for can be $25 maybe $30 but $30 should be and not a players handbook I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release someone is spiking this price boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series . The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price these books are not baseball cards this is very odd.



Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover) - low price of $34 on new book new is lower than a used



<http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/078691551X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230903867&sr=1-1>Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000) low price $3.15 - I own a copy of this now but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for the publicated dates are similar not a decade apart- YET the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other-



Ravenloft is a horror series- I just identified that as a no no BUT the devil is in the details a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well like if someone wanted to caricature oh a famous software CEO I don;t know what is in 3.5 but it is spiked and the gamma world I got -



<http://www.amazon.com/Defilers-Preservers-Wizards-Athas-Accessory/dp/078690383X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230904423&sr=1-1>Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)

<http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/078690383X/ref=sr_1_olp_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230904423&sr=1-1>8 Used & new from $23.49 - I do own this one now similar to the amazon price shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back most dungeons and dragons go down copyright 1996- there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes BUT there is a story in here it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups it turned a forest planet into a desert that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out not a long book 96 pages I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 but given what other D &D supplements there are this is gets targeted the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things additional spells and this and that few creatures but nothing several different books don't contian other books many ohte books contain similar things- wizard's handbook is similar. - The history is the only thing I didn't have.



The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more it appears - Bil gates destroying gamma world books ho ho ho yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb Jeff was with Gary Gygax he has been there a while - copyright 2000 192 pages or so oh the cover I got is there but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon the book is on amazon just not with the cover I have or that is there too but as a backup picture not the main one shown there is a different cover shown -

Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback) - low price of $24.95 for the new book the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens. - I paid $7.65 for mine on amazon on 12/16/08 plusa shipping - but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -



things like that can happen but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -



why are books important shutting of messages Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable many parables and like with defilers nad preservers there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want BUT it had a message severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first people in the US first- it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -



The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing - BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved many of those have been worthwhile there are messages in them -



SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES- I AM A REASON TOO BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE STORIES so that all moral conditioning is controlled- nifty huh the technology revolution in operation right here. - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well. There is a modicum of material. Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this. - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games. - yawning as I am about to email scratching back of head too with right hand and scratched scab with left by left side of nose. 9:25 EST 1/2/09.











All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com

I don't know if it rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something. People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product scumbag. I think the short version won't do I don;t know the products before I buy them. I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something $4.75 I think or $4.79 under $4 the next price is $18 on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong I knew that it was worth the risk for that price Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once now that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller usually there wil lbe a bidding war. Itching right thigh with right finers - but in this case I ordered it- I got the product it looked great but there was a lot of air in the box huge box and not much inside it was the Revised Edtion box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms Babylon 5 when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online like I even found a site the attic I think a premium role playing game seller- who previewed the first five pages there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games just a one line review how to tie things in the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 and it had two small books each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box normally when one orders an item on amazon amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items- pages missing so a ruelbook missing would count like that but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff - BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9 WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED- WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS. Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.

But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide I was hoping against hope to find a few page book preview and I did but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it because it wasn't what I fully wanted it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part. But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box so I didn't feel so cheated- but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide Babylon 5 through amazon and I wasn't initially planning to do that- THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine again the whoemver- government will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time or they come when something happens but with the recent game too of if it gets held and I didn't want it then they want me to return it and get something else so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund actually cancel the order) they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy the other side flipped that on them by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date but in order to get me to return like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take. And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars. Bit upper lip as I mentioned that. So what happened I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set. Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end movie references there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted- I had to go back to amazon to get info this time no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time but amazon had a page count ofor a box set and I checked the page count of the item I ordered against the pages I got and it is short a bit I do not I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon where they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes- and it's your fault for not reading the note that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes- but it said in the notes it wasn't english see you missed a detail it's your fualt versus should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with? - Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference. - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description but he sold me a different item that from the cover looked very similar and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available. And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick of course I get to rate him a second time as well. - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale. Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.. - I was putting more books in a box and mother woke up the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in they're all small boxes and mother was up in a flash like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books which neatened things up a little and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books. I did throw one out several months back but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.. But mother was up here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell german town where my fahter's family is from we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car. But we shall see the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that. She would have had to. She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle it would tag my computer- she does that- she had me order for christmas last year this book she never read a cartoony sort of physics book which sat on our coffee table she also has her own computer downstairs she could look it up she doens;t she asks me I declined she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance. I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much - I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out. Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous I mentioend that above but saying it down here made mne catch the error above. But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry- I am trying to get prepared to deal with that. You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time.







wpht's audio stream links are working again good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09



Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle. The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day - again we are taking the gives you hell from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you not with just a we hate piece ot it.



- education with levin I did lose -forgot what should go here I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up I do golf worse than the union memebers do.. At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think.




businesses in CO suffered because of the mad bomber - let's get this straight the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped- but we get more money during the holidays BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind which is crazy. It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business why have a shot like that we make more money- but you do it for all the wrong reasons and overall things would be better if it weren't done less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well and just bought when they wanted or needed something through the year. It works pretty well for me. Versus oh Christmas gifts are good gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me - stories that is not the norm.



like if everything keeps and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers that might be itneresting? - they'd scream we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is too big to fail - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me they do lean on people not to do things and that is not legal and like murders on buses beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way. Get more people to drive.



the marines like move along from All American Rejects I think although that one is good too -my pick for explaining things would be Gives You Hell - one of these days we'll stop fighting cause that is a central problem with a society not picking one side over the other but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending he got it right but society doesn't see that yet they ot it right bands are teams oo I guess.

Weaalth envy listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth the way he says it does reek of wealth envy and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument that people buy $500,000 parking spaces. And indeed even in Colorado that seems like someone set that up just to play with people- And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods that is true weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything the $500,000 NYC studio apartment and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual value of each of those dollars many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created in truth capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system in short people cheat like anything on the market and actually on several markets- real estate is an issue. Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping. Or is only halted. Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA or does it go out of state jsut a thought west losing power political power and financial power even in CA though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam. But back to the first point- I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws you can only be so much wealthy nor for rubbed right calf with left foot coughed passed gas nor for now I forget I will get hat(that) one though nor for licked lips lower lip as I got it nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy I may think about that a bit- not force but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point not sure on that a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities for very little good reason but I am not for telling a perosn don;t be ostentatious you have to live this way - the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO and the elites to control and fix that market prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay- and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it TWO get rid of one central head like that and focus one person that thinking will change is chaing freeware it's not one perosn it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out but it will that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public. But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class that fixes nothing the guy is basically telling them you can do it- jsut be secret our society has too many secrets - I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales in this age I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it I think that could yet be perfected. It is sort of agaisnt the idea of old capitlaism - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory.



But wealthy envy is an issue people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up the military is a good candidate for unions that is scary speak the language of bread uggghh but not the language of doing but of complying but they don't know well enough - um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and <mailto:vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov>vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever he tried to kill me or had others do it for him or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president- which theoretically can't happen legally and he will do something to me with the power he has he won't play by the rules - there was a book on Dragon empires in space which was kept cheap in order to it looked like what I wanted but it was designed to assuage me the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama and suggest it will not be the end of the USA- I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line mother's foot mvoed too can hear it so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom - got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else- touched right index finger to left thumb rubbing right calf with left foot the middle class and class envy people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 the waste bothers me some but I do not desire their life for it seems foolish the price paid. If more people were satisfied with what they the wealth envy issue would go away- moeny in most cases is not the issue it is dissatisfaction with life- and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand. And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade- sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this the price was right I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide like I don't know was i getting hlepd or hurt it appeared that i was getting helped- I got two used books for the price of a new one and at times beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way But uncertain and the door just bumped- the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide- the definiton of the planets is not so good- we shall see- because the review for that guide on amazon mentioning what I bought in the end prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it it was lower priced that immediately draws some suspicion again but it could be for two reasons one good one bad they do both and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked- the first batch on the second they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see though one did not go through without a fight they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids- like as a gorup I guess I will find out as things come in itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger. 1/1/09 15:49 EST



about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com got my first repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error as I got to the mail page for the new year 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est joy oh rapture.



1/1/09





FOX early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the the beauty of HI the beauty of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me- and I have to admit when I went to HI I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind in addition HI when I saw had bugs there were none in the pictures hmmm - HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.



On that note Junea or Anchorage for state capital sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute as well as city officials - AND I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business if it does like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions where things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center it won't give up the money or power Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields Itasca than suburbs of Pittsburgh - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money and another near deletion occurred here- seem to be doing a string of them I never did them before- that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it- mother I know gremlins can play with computers too they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well. - licking upper lip- - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places walmart and chicago mile which is impossible without a car and I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago. Definitely not in Chicago not even a walmart in Chicago and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe southwest sam's in Evansville. - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an oversight in their transit. It was on the way to the airport.. Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger - but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities - $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado - it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent for the parking. That is not a loop price. And someone wants that revenue versus having a stronger and better working transit system. So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money. - In my case people seem willing to kill over it. Touching upper lip with tongue.



popup window as I looked at notes and left thumb on right foot's center as I go to my notes

* touching thumbs

for the last email the full version



cbs news touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me technically barter should be illegal as I noted before not without using the monetary system they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their friends while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency it should be the equivalent of counterfeit that is the essence of what it is coughing as I put that up. It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it- BUT they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive I nearly deleted this section the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared and a hacker is probably behind that deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed - But not allow simply exchanges between friends - and my door bumped again. Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

 repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I was aobut to email curerent group and establish contact with nepal embassy.  15:37 EST 1/2/09

death of a sister of state legistor I think in corpus christi. 

John – KS – circuitous test – use fair tax as a litmus test on being a Republican – said it very circuitous fashion -  NO -  hosrt was right – in some ways it is fair to tax income -  taxing consumption appearently fairer because it is more of it than income -   Bullshit – poor get screwed – this is old crap – argued before -   Mark Simone-  got him – I am cheapskate basically -   - Mark they're going to do this all show-  they do it every show they can now -

 I didn't fully balance my checkbook right now -

15:19 EST – I think maruading orcs in eberron would be nicer to deal with than the current batch of callers to the right wing talk shows. 
Gooid afternoon – hand out – too mcuh pride for that – toilet phone – 40 miles- - auto industry – H – GM makes great cars but business model  -

Westchester – PA – nurse – surprised she got on – whateve that means – blistering defense of auto – we had a USA before  autos and will have one after.  - Velma – can't balance checkbook  and not a business person -

accidental pasting of an email address into Thai embassy contact form - 15:07 ESt 1/2/09 - I usually leave it and the ampersand caused an error it appears in the body of the message let me see - trher are other ampersans in here – and there is still a problem  - there are errors in the embassy of thailand's site not sure what message not going through – “error” word appearing in by body of message. 

accidental pasting of an email address into Thai embassy contact form - 15:07 ESt 1/2/09

guy hugged on cruise ship – who couldn't get citizenship and is now likely dead – hmmm – kinda convenient – a lot of people got into US recently. 

kicking off plane of muslim family – for talking about airport security - stirring up racism and schisms in Us during holdiays – making muslims feel less secure – discouraging msulim immigration – neat trick - - that sounds like gaming of an airline – and you can talk in a way to encourage that to happen to you – that story does sound fishy.  15:01 Est 1/2/09  - I would like people to stop for one day figuing out how to game the system.

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh – 1/2/09
Zaron – Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh – may know host – are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords – switched parties – on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse – in US over teacher awards – Canada – Quebec – politics flipping parties – Vermont – is not Granholm that is MI – telegenic – granholm is telegenic – what comes of her mouth does scare me though – and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA – Ken – tried to catch me with many numbers – pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems – I did not get down the 20,000 – I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score – so I got down the point – and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my “member” - first a sharp pain – when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears – the burning with a little pain – is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare – don't cure illnesses – want them to be chronic- a

Or I think – soicalized medicine – never heard you before are u english – I screwe up that question several months ago when i heard Mark Stein the first time.  - more MRI machies in philadelphia than in all of Canada – oh there's no black market-  yes – doctors become terrorism possibilities if they are immigrants – as mine was who was not american.  - and I did remember that. 

Rush will be back fighting fit on Monda – he needs a suit of powered armour – along with giant cattle prod that can zap callers voer their phone line. 
 snow off solar panels in MN
I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing. 
expand broadband internet in rural areas - 100 billion on green jobs.  - so everyone can be tracked via internet 
expand broadband internet in rural areas -  100 billion on green jobs. 
I am not sure arts funding is so bad an idea – get rid of “picking” whno gets funding – make a criteria – something like that-  don't pick artists to do artwork – I will look at it. 


emperoro Obama not King

southeast of Detoit – there is the song in the Us – end of the world as we know – caller mentions the phrase with Mark Stein's book -

forgot prefix for name for governor of TX website – 13:38 Est 1/2/09

you work with power potentially done with uraniusm – from a nculear pwoer reactor in New England so the answer may be yes. 

lubbock 5 hispanics car jacked and ran over people – follow pattern- sets up gun incidents- noted-  predicted – uggghh 1/2/09 – 13:32 EST

pasted the emailing list into boortz.com 13:30 eSt 1/2/09

India guy – 1 + 1 =3 argument - - whether democracy would spread from Iraq or not – is the middle east better with the Iraq of now or the Iraq of Sadam Husseiun – the caller is controlling the call.   And he mumbles at times and  circumnavigates – gettinjg off here and now.  Onto theoretcial and historical without application to now-  he is not applying historyu to present – jsut saayin history said this – not connecting – very sophistric. 

forget Atlantis – he'll rebuild Babylon – tower of Babel. 

the inmates are running the asylum with Obama elected. 

lynn wolsey – not a rep who says that – more than a trillion ?   - see the democratic reps – I thought pelosi had them under mind control at this point -

John Bronx – john mccain and his wife Cindy and Sarah Palin – papers unfair – grrrrr . 

12:37 1/2/09
Obama take a look in lungs and see if they're healthy-  call 1 and threat 1 for the new year- my lungs and cancer  threats before  -  smokled for 24 years – and low and behold he may not survive.  H Frank Sinatra – mob call -   caller  I swmoke – that's my right- my favorite host caller said – the host is a problem. 

never make a joke – someone will do it for real – I wish that were funny – it is too true. 

payless shoes – peopel did make fun of my shoes from payless – then I started going to walmart for those too – payless may be another “funny” comapny or have contributed – they have a store near DAM which I shopped in.    

Reeducation camps for Rush – I would not be surprised. 

There is no wainscoat in my bathrooms – and yes – the nuclear wackos witched to global warming and no one said anything.

Mark Stein – for Rush Limbaugh

yes I thought it was weird on the BBC where the BBC was discussing tony Blair's man boobs – it woudl not be discussed on US news – aussies too eh  - maybe tony blair and I have something in common. 

I have noticed that Gaza seems to be a hot plutonium chernobyl sized potato for Obama- I did notice that initially – the timing

--
we're

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 – nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho – grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand – as I thought to wait – they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way – mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on – but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors – this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others – but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this – and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo – some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est – as soon as I tried to mail a second time – on yahoo mail. Hmmm – that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description – the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set – is – from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) – well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12 – I can't but though cuurently – I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high – considering other prices on other items

if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set

Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $35 – that is spiked – it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for – can be $25 maybe $30 – but $30 should be and not a players  handbook – I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release – someone is spiking this price – boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series .   The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price – these books are not baseball cards – this is very odd. 

Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $34 on new book – new is lower than a used

Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000)  low price  $3.15  - I own a copy of this now – but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for – the publicated dates are similar – not a decade apart- YET – the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other- 

Ravenloft is a horror series-  I just identified that as a no – no – BUT – the devil is in the details – a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well – like if someone wanted to caricature  oh a famous software CEO – I don;t know what is in 3.5 – but it is spiked – and the gamma world I got -

Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)
8 Used & new from $23.49   -  I do own this one now – similar to the amazon price – shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back – most dungeons and dragons go down  copyright 1996-  there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes – BUT – there is a story in here – it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups – it turned a forest planet into a desert – that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out – not a long book – 96 pages – I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 – but given what other D &D supplements there are – this is gets targeted – the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things – additional spells and this and that – few creatures – but nothing several different books don't contian – other books – many ohte books contain similar things-  wizard's handbook is similar.  - The history is the only thing I didn't have. 

The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more – it appears -  Bil gates destroying gamma world books – ho ho ho – yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book – by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb – Jeff was with Gary Gygax – he has been there a while -  copyright 2000 – 192 pages or so – oh – the cover I got is there – but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon – the book is on amazon – just not with the cover I have – or that is there too – but as a backup picture – not the main one shown – there is a different cover shown -
Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback)  - low price of  $24.95 – for the new book – the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens.  - I paid  $7.65 for mine on amazon on  12/16/08 – plusa shipping -  but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -

things like that can happen – but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -

why are books important – shutting of messages – Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable – many parables and like with defilers nad preservers – there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want – BUT – it had a message – severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest – and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first – people in the US first-  it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -

The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing -  BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE  - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved – many of those have been worthwhile – there are messages in them -

SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES – INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES-  I AM A REASON TOO – BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL – KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION – WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS – GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE – STORIES – so that all moral conditioning is controlled-  nifty huh – the technology revolution in operation right here.  - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well..   There is a modicum of material.   Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this.  - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games.   - yawning as I am about to email – scratching back of head too – with right hand – and scratched scab with left by left side of nose.   9:25 EST 1/2/09. 





All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com
I don't know if it – rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this – it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing – but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something.   People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever – in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product – scumbag.   I think the short version won't do – I don;t know the products before I buy them.  I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 – there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something  $4.75 I think or $4.79 – under $4 – the next price is $18 – on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong – I knew that – it was worth the risk – for that price – Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book – happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once – now  that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller – usually there wil lbe a bidding war.   Itching right thigh with right finers -  but in this case I ordered it-  I got the product – it looked great – but there was a lot of air in the box – huge box and not much inside – it was the Revised Edtion – box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms – Babylon 5 – when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online – like I even found a site – the attic I think a premium role playing game seller-  who previewed the first five pages – there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games – just a one line review – how to tie things in – the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 – and it had two small books – each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it – BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT  - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box – normally when one orders an item on amazon – amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items-  pages missing – so a ruelbook missing would count like that – but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside – I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff -  BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON – YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION – VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT – BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT – YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH – IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9  WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES – WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-  WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME – PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN – THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE – AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU  FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH – WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS.   Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.  
But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms – no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide – I was hoping  against hope to find a few page book preview – and I did – but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it – because it wasn't what I fully wanted – it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was – BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part.  But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price – I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box – so I didn't feel so cheated-  but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs – I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide – Babylon 5 – through amazon – and I wasn't initially planning to do that-  THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come – probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine – again the whoemver- government – will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time – or they come when something happens – but with the recent game too of – if it gets held and I didn't want it – then they want me to return it and get something else – so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund – actually cancel the order) – they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy – the other side flipped that on them – by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal – and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date – but in order to get me to return – like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy – the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take.   And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide – and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars.    Bit upper lip as I mentioned that.   So what happened – I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set.  Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly – this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end – movie references – there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 – I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller – that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted-  I had to go back to amazon to get info this time – no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time – but amazon had a page count ofor a box set – and I checked the page count of the item I ordered – against the pages I got and it is short a bit – I do not – I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed – which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon – where – they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes-  and it's your fault for not reading the note – that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes-  but it said in the notes it wasn't english – see you missed a detail – it's your fualt – versus – should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with?  -  Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference.  - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description – but he sold me a different item – that from the cover looked very similar – and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available.   And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick – of course  I get to rate him a second time as well.  - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale.    Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.   - I was putting more books in a box – and mother woke – up – the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again – because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in – they're all small boxes – and mother was up in a flash – like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books – which neatened things up a little – and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books.  I did throw one out several months back – but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.  But mother was up  here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell – german town where my fahter's family is from – we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII – and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me – and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car.  But we shall see – the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous – but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that.  She would have had to.   She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle – it would tag my computer-  she does that-  she had me order for christmas last year – this book she never read – a cartoony sort of physics – book which sat on our coffee table – she also has her own computer downstairs – she could look it up – she doens;t she asks me – I declined – she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance.   I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much -  I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me – when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out.   Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed – but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation – she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous – I mentioend that above – but saying it down here made mne catch the error above.  But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this – if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry-  I am trying to get prepared to deal with that.   You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time. 



wpht's audio stream links are working again – good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09

Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep – rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle.  The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too – and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day -  again we are taking the “gives you hell” from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you – not with just a we hate piece ot it. 

- education with levin – I did lose  -forgot what should go here – I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up – I do golf worse than the union memebers do.   At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think. 


businesses in CO suffered because of the “mad bomber” - let's get this straight – the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped-  but we get more money during the holidays – BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't – don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind – which is crazy.  It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays – it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is  harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business – why have a shot like that – we make more money-  but you do it for all the wrong reasons – and overall things would be better if it weren't done – less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well – and just bought when they wanted or needed something – through the year.  It works pretty well for me.   Versus – oh Christmas – gifts are good – gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people – because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same – most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no – “I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me” - stories – that is not the norm.

like if everything keeps – and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case – could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers – that might be itneresting? - they'd scream – we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is “too big to fail” - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering – though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job – but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me – they do “lean” on people not to do things and that is not legal – and like murders on buses – beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way.   Get more people to drive. 

the marines like “move along” from All American Rejects – I think although that one is good too  -my pick for explaining things would be “Gives You Hell” - one of these days we'll stop fighting – cause that is a central problem with a society – not picking one side over the other – but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST  - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending – he got it right – but society doesn't see that yet – they ot it right – bands are teams oo I guess. 

rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com.  Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09  16:10 maybe

Weaalth envy – listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation – shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth – the way he says it does reek of wealth envy – and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument – that people buy $500,000 parking spaces.    And indeed even in Colorado that seems like – someone set that up just to play with people-   And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value – too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods – that is true – weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything – the $500,000 NYC studio apartment – and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue – the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual “value” of each of those dollars – many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created – in truth – capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it – but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system – in short people cheat like anything on the market – and actually on several markets-  real estate is an issue.  Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping.  Or is only halted.   Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA – or does it go out of state – jsut a thought – west losing power – political power and financial power – even in CA – though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam.  But back to the first point-  I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws – you can only be so much wealthy – nor for – rubbed  right calf with left foot – coughed – passed gas – nor for – now I forget – I will get hat(that) one though – nor for – licked lips lower lip as I got it – nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy – I may think about that a bit-  not force – but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) – do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point – not sure on that – a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities – for very little good reason – but I am not for telling a perosn – don;t be ostentatious – you have to live this way -   the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure – the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US – as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO – and the elites to control and fix that market – prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs – there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay-  and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism – more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it – TWO – get rid of one central head like that and focus one person – that thinking will change – is chaing – freeware – it's not one perosn – it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out – but it will – that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis – who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public.   But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class – that fixes nothing – the guy is basically telling them – you can do it-  jsut be secret – our society has too many secrets -  I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales – in this age – I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it – I think that could yet be perfected.   It is sort of agaisnt the idea of “old capitlaism” - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product – better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory. 

But wealthy envy is an issue – people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up – the military is a good candidate for unions – that is scary – speak the language of bread – uggghh – but not the language of doing but of complying – but they don't know well enough -  um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list – he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever – he tried to kill me – or had others do it for him – or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate – and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president-  which theoretically can't happen legally – and he will do something to me with the power he has – he won't play by the rules -  there was a book on Dragon empires in space – which was kept cheap  in order to – it looked like what I wanted – but it was designed to assuage me – the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama – and suggest it will not be the end of the USA-  I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line – mother's foot mvoed too – can hear it – so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom -    got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else-  touched right index finger to left thumb – rubbing right calf with left foot – the middle class and class envy – people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 – the waste bothers me some – but I do not desire their life – for it seems foolish – the price paid.   If more people were satisfied with what they – the wealth envy issue would go away-  moeny in most cases is not the issue – it is dissatisfaction with life-  and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand.    And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned  on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere – I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade-  sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this – the price was right – I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully – it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide – like I don't know – was i getting hlepd or hurt – it appeared that i was getting helped-  I got two used books for the price of a new one – and at times – beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way – But uncertain – and the door just bumped-  the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide-  the definiton of the planets is not so good-  we shall see-   because the review for that guide on amazon – mentioning what I bought in the end – prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it – it was lower priced – that immediately draws some suspicion – again – but it could be for two reasons – one good – one bad – they do both – and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked-  the first batch – on the second – they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see – though one did not go through without a fight – they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids-  like as a gorup – I guess I will find out as things come in – itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger.  1/1/09 15:49 EST

about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com – got my first  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I got to the mail page  for the new year – 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est – joy oh rapture. 

1/1/09   


FOX – early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the “the beauty” of HI – the “beauty” of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me-  and I have to admit – when I went to HI – I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind – in addition – HI when I saw had bugs – there were none in the pictures – hmmm -  HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.   

On that note – Junea or Anchorage for state capital – sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute – as well as city officials -  AND – I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power – Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business  if it does – like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions – where – things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center – it won't give up the money or power – Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields – Itasca – than suburbs of Pittsburgh  - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes – my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money – and another near deletion occurred here-  seem to be doing a string of them – I never did them before-  that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it-  mother – I know gremlins can play with computers too – they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well.  - licking upper lip-  - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry – hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words – In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places – walmart and chicago mile – which is impossible without a car and  I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago.  Definitely not in Chicago – not even a walmart in Chicago – and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe – southwest – sam's in Evansville.  - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an “oversight” in their transit.  It was on the way to the airport.    Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger -  but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars – there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities -  $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado -  it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent – for the parking.   That is not a loop price.   And someone wants that revenue – versus having a stronger and better working transit system.   So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money.    - In my case people seem willing to kill over it.   Touching upper lip with tongue.

cbs news – touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me – technically barter should be illegal as I noted before – not without using the monetary system – they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their “friends” while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system – you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency – it should be the equivalent of counterfeit – that is the essence of what it is – coughing as I put that up.  It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another – and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it-  BUT – they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money – we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless – maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early – bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive – I nearly deleted this section – the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error – and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared – and a hacker is probably behind that – deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen – perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price – that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed  - But not allow simply exchanges between friends -  and my door bumped again.  Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 – total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

planned parenthood sent me a letter today

walmart bombthrat(bombthreat)  in TX – there are a few things going in walmart in lubbock these days – it coudl be connected – I would bet money on it at this point.  - all the activity at walmart discourages sales and certain higher class people who normally don't shop here and MIGHT WANT TO START - that is the way to stop them from starting  - walmart online might be an interesting tool to use with some. 

16:30 eSt
dining and whining about fruitcake -

slippedi n food comment in Hamas Israel discussion -  we are not oppressing canadian – they would disagree – most of them would  - locked in food and prison – prisons is a threat

Morgan freeman used to be part of that bipartisan organization on healthcare – which like all bi-partisan organizations or msot of them has turned out to be a lie – the purple elephant donkey – his colon cancer ad council thing on kfyo

16:22
Eliot spitzer hotel.  - for Obama – this occurred earlier. 


Phoenix Jim – 70 – auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not – govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need – we don't need them – we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here – and try to sell at premium in US – and in other coutnries they actually compete – they could price different in other countries than in US – and with Nafta – not NAFTA WTO – mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently – so big 3 – gouge US customers potentially – but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3 – make a plan – but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code – they all rate their education – and he slipped in something softly while I was typing – car thing – they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten – see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller – H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war – no we don't – we probably could “Create” an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii – do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout – militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami – charity – dumping thousands of shoes – I need shoes – sometimes – glue could be drying out – oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there – did someone figure that out – I didn't want to mention that – there is a backup shoe – unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family – sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight – could not get up – amber alert – silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo – ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris – they are like poison pills – the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken – but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point – others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA – people want to go snowboarding anyway – risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can. 

Jennifer  she was on a charity person – non-profitr worker – one of these was - – didn't complete a point – seemd to jump all over- may be making fun of what my wqriting sounds like – but she is on air – and that was an interesting call – I also wasn't typing on computer- which may be why she was not coherent-  she knew she wouldn't catc h me-  writing off computer which somehow I can listen and write off the computer better.   - started with thing about some liberal callers not stupid.

Westchester – PA – nurse – surprised she got on – whateve that means – blistering defense of auto – we had a USA before  autos and will have one after.  - Velma – can't balance checkbook  and not a business person -

accidental pasting of an email address into Thai embassy contact form - 15:07 ESt 1/2/09 - I usually leave it and the ampersand caused an error it appears in the body of the message let me see - trher are other ampersans in here – and there is still a problem  - there are errors in the embassy of thailand's site not sure what message not going through – “error” word appearing in by body of message. 

accidental pasting of an email address into Thai embassy contact form - 15:07 ESt 1/2/09

guy hugged on cruise ship – who couldn't get citizenship and is now likely dead – hmmm – kinda convenient – a lot of people got into US recently. 

kicking off plane of muslim family – for talking about airport security - stirring up racism and schisms in Us during holdiays – making muslims feel less secure – discouraging msulim immigration – neat trick - - that sounds like gaming of an airline – and you can talk in a way to encourage that to happen to you – that story does sound fishy.  15:01 Est 1/2/09  - I would like people to stop for one day figuing out how to game the system.

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh – 1/2/09
Zaron – Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh – may know host – are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords – switched parties – on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse – in US over teacher awards – Canada – Quebec – politics flipping parties – Vermont – is not Granholm that is MI – telegenic – granholm is telegenic – what comes of her mouth does scare me though – and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA – Ken – tried to catch me with many numbers – pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems – I did not get down the 20,000 – I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score – so I got down the point – and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my “member” - first a sharp pain – when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears – the burning with a little pain – is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare – don't cure illnesses – want them to be chronic- a

Or I think – soicalized medicine – never heard you before are u english – I screwe up that question several months ago when i heard Mark Stein the first time.  - more MRI machies in philadelphia than in all of Canada – oh there's no black market-  yes – doctors become terrorism possibilities if they are immigrants – as mine was who was not american.  - and I did remember that. 

Rush will be back fighting fit on Monda – he needs a suit of powered armour – along with giant cattle prod that can zap callers voer their phone line. 
 snow off solar panels in MN
I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing. 
expand broadband internet in rural areas - 100 billion on green jobs..  - so everyone can be tracked via internet 
expand broadband internet in rural areas -  100 billion on green jobs. 
I am not sure arts funding is so bad an idea – get rid of “picking” whno gets funding – make a criteria – something like that-  don't pick artists to do artwork – I will look at it. 


emperoro Obama not King

southeast of Detoit – there is the song in the Us – end of the world as we know – caller mentions the phrase with Mark Stein's book - 
--
forgot prefix for name for governor of TX website – 13:38 Est 1/2/09

you work with power potentially done with uraniusm – from a nculear pwoer reactor in New England so the answer may be yes. 

lubbock 5 hispanics car jacked and ran over people – follow pattern- sets up gun incidents- noted-  predicted – uggghh 1/2/09 – 13:32 EST

pasted the emailing list into boortz.com 13:30 eSt 1/2/09

India guy – 1 + 1 =3 argument - - whether democracy would spread from Iraq or not – is the middle east better with the Iraq of now or the Iraq of Sadam Husseiun – the caller is controlling the call.   And he mumbles at times and  circumnavigates – gettinjg off here and now.  Onto theoretcial and historical without application to now-  he is not applying historyu to present – jsut saayin history said this – not connecting – very sophistric. 

forget Atlantis – he'll rebuild Babylon – tower of Babel. 

the inmates are running the asylum with Obama elected. 

lynn wolsey – not a rep who says that – more than a trillion ?   - see the democratic reps – I thought pelosi had them under mind control at this point -

John Bronx – john mccain and his wife Cindy and Sarah Palin – papers unfair – grrrrr . 

12:37 1/2/09
Obama take a look in lungs and see if they're healthy-  call 1 and threat 1 for the new year- my lungs and cancer  threats before  -  smokled for 24 years – and low and behold he may not survive.  H Frank Sinatra – mob call -   caller  I swmoke – that's my right- my favorite host caller said – the host is a problem. 

never make a joke – someone will do it for real – I wish that were funny – it is too true. 

payless shoes – peopel did make fun of my shoes from payless – then I started going to walmart for those too – payless may be another “funny” comapny or have contributed – they have a store near DAM which I shopped in.    

Reeducation camps for Rush – I would not be surprised. 

There is no wainscoat in my bathrooms – and yes – the nuclear wackos witched to global warming and no one said anything. 

--
Mark Stein – for Rush Limbaugh

yes I thought it was weird on the BBC where the BBC was discussing tony Blair's man boobs – it woudl not be discussed on US news – aussies too eh  - maybe tony blair and I have something in common. 

I have noticed that Gaza seems to be a hot plutonium chernobyl sized potato for Obama- I did notice that initially – the timing

--
we're

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 – nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho – grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand – as I thought to wait – they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way – mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on – but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors – this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others – but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this – and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo – some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est – as soon as I tried to mail a second time – on yahoo mail. Hmmm – that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description – the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set – is – from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) – well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12 – I can't but though cuurently – I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high – considering other prices on other items

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

running around forehead on top of skull as I get to the contact form of the governator.  17:08 EST 1/2/08 – what are you doing new year's eve – design stuff – you

freeing prisonwers to save money – not a bad experiment

pain in thumb – left hand – like sprained thumb – but ot didn't connect. 

16:54 EST 1/2/09 – so the church of scientology cruise and travolta did try to get me – more than likely and they paid the price – another CIA ad on kfyo  -  that's two today- so they are doing multiple attacks on me per day now – oh this gets better and better – I am still alive and typing – thanks – appreciate it – why do they get to stay out there? - that is a loaded question. 

planned parenthood sent me a letter today

dsisease filled rats were in the vehicles of vietnam – double meaning taken – I wonder how those got so popular there – oh the witches at their best. 

Jenniefer – I think – doing my homework – that is what I started doing a minute ago in a sense – something besides listening alone - -

donny st louis – not responding to call

walmart bombthrat(bombthreat)  in TX – there are a few things going in walmart in lubbock these days – it coudl be connected – I would bet money on it at this point.  - all the activity at walmart discourages sales and certain higher class people who normally don't shop here and MIGHT WANT TO START - that is the way to stop them from starting  - walmart online might be an interesting tool to use with some.

16:30 eSt
dining and whining about fruitcake -

slippedi n food comment in Hamas Israel discussion -  we are not oppressing canadian – they would disagree – most of them would  - locked in food and prison – prisons is a threat

Morgan freeman used to be part of that bipartisan organization on healthcare – which like all bi-partisan organizations or msot of them has turned out to be a lie – the purple elephant donkey – his colon cancer ad council thing on kfyo

16:22
Eliot spitzer hotel.  - for Obama – this occurred earlier. 


Phoenix Jim – 70 – auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not – govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need – we don't need them – we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here – and try to sell at premium in US – and in other coutnries they actually compete – they could price different in other countries than in US – and with Nafta – not NAFTA WTO – mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently – so big 3 – gouge US customers potentially – but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3 – make a plan – but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code – they all rate their education – and he slipped in something softly while I was typing – car thing – they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten – see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller – H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war – no we don't – we probably could “Create” an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii – do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout – militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami – charity – dumping thousands of shoes – I need shoes – sometimes – glue could be drying out – oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there – did someone figure that out – I didn't want to mention that – there is a backup shoe – unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family – sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight – could not get up – amber alert – silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo – ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris – they are like poison pills – the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken – but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point – others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA – people want to go snowboarding anyway – risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can. 

Jennifer  she was on a charity person – non-profitr worker – one of these was - – didn't complete a point – seemd to jump all over- may be making fun of what my wqriting sounds like – but she is on air – and that was an interesting call – I also wasn't typing on computer- which may be why she was not coherent-  she knew she wouldn't catc h me-  writing off computer which somehow I can listen and write off the computer better.   - started with thing about some liberal callers not stupid.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it.  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09 – kfyo – that is a first

btw – trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem – you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009 – DJI Average Dow Jones while up – the chart is bumpy – whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago – the US chart still has zig-zags – smaller ones-  but they are there – and that means fun and games – arbitrage – zig zags help arbitrage – but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton – hi mom . Ligh volume it was said so light arbitrage

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking .

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that.

On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations.. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue – high school and elementary – 2 instances each that I see – high school more – but 2 in elementary – and then Pittsburgh – the thread follows – in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person – but there were in elemenary and high – elemtary into junior – mother's election helper – she is running around now downstaits – I can't trace – Milan? - Chicago – I didn't know the names – the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral – I never suspected.  - 3 – oh wow – 3 – so much of this country hated me – driveways and odd trades – a one time incident – just happened – left no mark – just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me – but people from farther away – it wasn't an accident – none of it was an accident as early as – pretty early – it wasn't accidental – children aren't fully innocent for very long – the same people in one case where one thing happened – they would appear later – much later college from elementary school – I don't know what happens to others – in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random – very few – cause you can trace the same few classmates involved – i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes – but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open – there si a reason I don't come out in the open – in fact – all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution – I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it – there is sort of this american – it's best if you don't ahve to hide – we want to see you – BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it – and you are kind of forcing me out into the open – and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result – and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes – yes it would be better in time – it isn't right now – for many reasons people cannot handle it – I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas – not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out – it may ahve been the only way – as I stated a few months ago – so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding – but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful – my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden – but you forced it – and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way – I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done – I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it – I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative – itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone – that may not be possible – but – I am worried that you are a planning a surprise – I don;t want antoher surprise – there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, “Give You Hell”
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects “Give You Hell” and “We Didin't Start the Fire” Billy Joel – Madonna – whether I like her or not – “Just Like a Prayer” – “Move Along” All Aermican Rejects - - “It Ends Tonight” All American Rejects – the Wendy's commercial - “Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show” - in fairness Madonna can do it in others – she can also hide a message in hers – the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it – like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture – for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to – I will a music video – the right one – not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times – until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them – teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing – butyet a music video many things go – the well done ones – I named them up top – or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish – EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy – the backround isn't wasted – the facial expressions aren't wasted – everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society – billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes – to some degree – but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation – a pop up window came up on the “abou” of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that – where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  “because you would have utter choas” - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se – but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not – they do convey messages – but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it – the groupings – I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all – have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe – itching my right knee with right fingers wildly – stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video – but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe – organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements – as I element teaching jobs – it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to “make it cool” - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them – the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.  
hit he “end” key and didn't mean to 11:28 Est

Chicago he did have me prepare a graphic presentation – and then CCAC 2002.

So we halted war usable item trade with Japan before pearl harbor.  They were attacking other countries to prompt that.   There was apparently from what I saw a detailed plan on

Odd breathing – sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name – though one's married name – she kept her own name – but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me – even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor – what are you doing here? – I might ask ou the same question. 

I don't want – French – no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher – not language – French american – and there weren't many if any French American sudents – both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence – one from France – one in high school and one in CMU – music in elementary school – then 5th grade or 6th she was both years – I am skipping one there – I can't find something he did – things happened around him and were trigered by other children – one time – I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities – but 4 out of the 5 seemed – odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen – and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong – and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course – my failure was planned – and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  “You can do this with every group” - that's just it – no, I can't – it doesn't work with Indian professors – it doesn't work Italians – there are individual – but not 80% - 20% if that – I don't think it works with the Irish – there were some bad experiences – but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est – mother came up starting questioning me through the door – throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus – she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet – though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though – about how dangerous it is – though someone will try to make her seem right – she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with “move along” the song – but used by nice productions – you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong – passed gas as I started writing this – et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps – they don't like it – 8:39 EST 1/3/09 – don't ahve to take a trip to the post office – can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county – he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here – Dupage – no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't – next county over – it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that – have  my mind combine two names – so I can't see – it's partly familar and partly wrong – rubbed right side of face with right middle finger – well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to – but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents – being asked to eat the leftovers – twice in my life – once by the – where did he live northwest chicago – but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh – but he took the metro in – not metro – metra as they are two different systems in Chicago  – I visited there in 2004- the office is gone – but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do – it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004 – someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin – container – deep or potato something – again it seemed out of place – polish –  at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003 – a woman – night shift – but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german – it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean – I do not know what to think on Milan – he was a nexus – saw him twice – he got me out of chicago or his wife did – but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me – he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh – had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire – as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have – and I guess- like he released me – he manueverd my anger and he did – it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time – rubbed left ear with left middle finger – they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people – by race – and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh – I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town – Pittsburgh is a town in many ways – it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't – there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go – I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much – I did drive down to see him in Southwest – I jsut didn't park too well as usual – cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say – about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention – the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully “managed” by other groups in the coutnry – yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU – she probably helped a great deal – was I a test for Pittsburgh – it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon – whatever – was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time..  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it..  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09 – kfyo – that is a first

btw – trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem – you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009 – DJI Average Dow Jones while up – the chart is bumpy – whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago – the US chart still has zig-zags – smaller ones-  but they are there – and that means fun and games – arbitrage – zig zags help arbitrage – but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton – hi mom . Ligh volume it was said so light arbitrage

Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

netflix – the government movie capital – yes – they have aligned with the children it appears – and they give me ads a lot – banner ads.  

what Japan's legitimate grievances (for WWII) ? – callwer – Nazi prisoners in US got movie passes – uncle didn'ty mention that – great uncle actually – we never met – only stories through parents -  firebombing of Dresden killed civillians – and he said nothing just a laugh – daughter could not drink – it is about the arsenic in the water in TN – which mother let me hear on NPR -  you don't mind it if I can't eat – now your daughter can't drink – amd I bet she can – but it's difficult – do unto others as you want them to do unto you is a Christina comnandment – did you “forget” that one with me ?  - perhaps you are being reminded – God likes that – if you would take away another's hosue than your hosue is taken away if you woudl deprive one of sustenance then yours is taken away.  17:44 EST 1/2/09

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking . There   Military interrogator of foreign military – is the caller.  

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

pain in thumb – left hand – like sprained thumb – but ot didn't connect. 

16:54 EST 1/2/09 – so the church of scientology cruise and travolta did try to get me – more than likely and they paid the price – another CIA ad on kfyo  -  that's two today- so they are doing multiple attacks on me per day now – oh this gets better and better – I am still alive and typing – thanks – appreciate it – why do they get to stay out there? - that is a loaded question. 

planned parenthood sent me a letter today

dsisease filled rats were in the vehicles of vietnam – double meaning taken – I wonder how those got so popular there – oh the witches at their best. 

Jenniefer – I think – doing my homework – that is what I started doing a minute ago in a sense – something besides listening alone - -

donny st louis – not responding to call

walmart bombthrat(bombthreat)  in TX – there are a few things going in walmart in lubbock these days – it coudl be connected – I would bet money on it at this point.  - all the activity at walmart discourages sales and certain higher class people who normally don't shop here and MIGHT WANT TO START - that is the way to stop them from starting  - walmart online might be an interesting tool to use with some.

Eliot spitzer hotel.  - for Obama – this occurred earlier. 


Phoenix Jim – 70 – auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not – govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need – we don't need them – we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here – and try to sell at premium in US – and in other coutnries they actually compete – they could price different in other countries than in US – and with Nafta – not NAFTA WTO – mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently – so big 3 – gouge US customers potentially – but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3 – make a plan – but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code – they all rate their education – and he slipped in something softly while I was typing – car thing – they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten – see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller – H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war – no we don't – we probably could “Create” an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii – do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout – militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami – charity – dumping thousands of shoes – I need shoes – sometimes – glue could be drying out – oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there – did someone figure that out – I didn't want to mention that – there is a backup shoe – unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family – sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight – could not get up – amber alert – silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo – ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris – they are like poison pills – the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken – but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point – others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA – people want to go snowboarding anyway – risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can. 

Jennifer  she was on a charity person – non-profitr worker – one of these was - – didn't complete a point – seemd to jump all over- may be making fun of what my wqriting sounds like – but she is on air – and that was an interesting call – I also wasn't typing on computer- which may be why she was not coherent-  she knew she wouldn't catc h me-  writing off computer which somehow I can listen and write off the computer better.   - started with thing about some liberal callers not stupid. 

TGIM – Thank God it's monday- we are still going to see plenty of fruicakes -  Travolta's son has died – that chruich scientology is not such a good thing – they lie. 

I got the brother of Obama and the aunt of Obama points on Limbaugh – a flwesh eating troll would be kinder to deal with as president.   The cia again 15:52 Est – on kfyo – their ads are more common and I am beginning to think it no longer signals what it used to.. 

tax cuts drive economy – defucut spwedning gets an economy moving – Reagan did it – Jeff – he seemed to get angry as I elaborated on the last call -his tone got hostile – I wans't listening to him. -  caller Jeff - - I had a computer error which caused a lapse- 15:48 eSt 1/2/09

save money for a little while – this caller sounds almost pittsburgh – the diction on that – anybody who pays 0 taxes-  there are people who don't buy anyhting  - they pay no tax – yes so what the caller is trying to do is say my way of life will destroy everything – couldn't we just revise how taxes are collected -versus killing me off- if that is issue – I need a lot less services than people to because I don't own a home and it does reduce waste and not owning a car reduces use of gov't services so is it so unfair I pay little taxes-  the gov't power of Pittsburgh does not want to risk reducing size so it wanted o condition me against my will to spend more- but that is against the constitution and they “overlook” what is lost by taking hte attitude they have the right to condition me to spend more to float their gov't when they are losing people and city services aren't so necessary and perhaps they should cut jbos out of the city governmwent-  because they do have less people – and they try not to.   Tehy don;t want to hear later that will lead to more jobs- better o get rid of unproductive jobs- but Pittsburgh didn't work that way

John – KS – circuitous test – use fair tax as a litmus test on being a Republican – said it very circuitous fashion -  NO -  hosrt was right – in some ways it is fair to tax income -  taxing consumption appearently fairer because it is more of it than income -   Bullshit – poor get screwed – this is old crap – argued before -   Mark Simone-  got him – I am cheapskate basically -   - Mark they're going to do this all show-  they do it every show they can now -

accidental pasting of an email address into Thai embassy contact form - 15:07 ESt 1/2/09 - I usually leave it and the ampersand caused an error it appears in the body of the message let me see - trher are other ampersans in here – and there is still a problem  - there are errors in the embassy of thailand's site not sure what message not going through – “error” word appearing in by body of message.

guy hugged on cruise ship – who couldn't get citizenship and is now likely dead – hmmm – kinda convenient – a lot of people got into US recently. 

kicking off plane of muslim family – for talking about airport security - stirring up racism and schisms in Us during holdiays – making muslims feel less secure – discouraging msulim immigration – neat trick - - that sounds like gaming of an airline – and you can talk in a way to encourage that to happen to you – that story does sound fishy.  15:01 Est 1/2/09  - I would like people to stop for one day figuing out how to game the system.

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh – 1/2/09
Zaron – Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh – may know host – are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords – switched parties – on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse – in US over teacher awards – Canada – Quebec – politics flipping parties – Vermont – is not Granholm that is MI – telegenic – granholm is telegenic – what comes of her mouth does scare me though – and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA – Ken – tried to catch me with many numbers – pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems – I did not get down the 20,000 – I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score – so I got down the point – and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my “member” - first a sharp pain – when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears – the burning with a little pain – is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare – don't cure illnesses – want them to be chronic- a

Or I think – soicalized medicine – never heard you before are u english – I screwe up that question several months ago when i heard Mark Stein the first time.  - more MRI machies in philadelphia than in all of Canada – oh there's no black market-  yes – doctors become terrorism possibilities if they are immigrants – as mine was who was not american.  - and I did remember that. 

Rush will be back fighting fit on Monda – he needs a suit of powered armour – along with giant cattle prod that can zap callers voer their phone line.

I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

was going to email boortz from a different windows-  I have his opened – but decided to do it by typing his name and opening another one – I accidentally opened the first one when trying to go to the document to make sure I was emailing him the right thing and I hit the wrong tab and almsot used it before realizing the mistake.   It's like having a doesn(dozen) microphones attached to you. 

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time – right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly – then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched – 8:13 Est – just can't stop it. Ho ho ho – right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that – and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days – figure out how to do this to people – wow. 

with senator reid a second time – had the wrong thing in the clipbaord – pasted wrong thing first – 8:09 EST 1/4/09.   - pinky on right hand bumped into empty yogurt cup next to it as I decided to go to another senator instead. 

there was a slight touching of my middle and inddex fingers in my left hand -followed by me curling my toes as I decided to write it up as I went back to and emailed mccain.senate.gov 8:07 ESt 1/4/09

and forgot with reid.senate.gov – did not have message ready that I wanted – just the single line forgot to compesate – wrong thing on clipboard when pasting – 7:51 Est 1/4/09 – so I decided to wait and mail him later.  and success - paste error on mccain.senate.gov -2nd time successful - so I won't email either - wait on him 7:53 EST.  Success because it made them do another error - bruth left hand under right under upperarm- by armpit  also as I wrote this up.  - and first try on rove.com but my left thumb still hit my stomach ever so slightly and ti doesn't normally do that.  and the typoing got slow for a moment.  7:58 ESt do it in Rove's window.  Coughing as I switch to the clintonfoundation.  Licked upper lip as I decided to go on t newt.org.   Touched right thumb to right index finger as I pulled up nightlybusiness.org instead. Normally it doesn't happen and I am having issues iwth my lips – touching them.  Touchign index and thumb again on right hand as I went to move off nightly business. 

paste error hutchison.senate.gov 7:48 1/4/09 - 2nd time successful.

the truth potentially – IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show – and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie – maybe not started by him – but he believed that too – that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care – ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY – THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS – IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT – THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO – IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn – they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know – much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds – 20 -30 east flying heading north – I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities – most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example – to make money he or they could just do another movie – or write a book – a charity is not – there is work and cost – like to take people's compalints and research them – even if the idea is to block the complaint – someone has to take and research it – and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it – licking upper lip and now coughing – one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be – that charities are easy money – a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY – THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL – YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months – or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior – there are potential others – a form of of population control – etc etc – in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity – OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class – to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society – really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money – cancer research instead of education funding – making education super expensive – conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end – you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead – I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization – like I can't believe it – it would so not demoncracy – I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces – we can pass any law we want to – I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment – coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going – the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus – the other stimuli did not stimulate well – the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others – then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade – this would include IL too – it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible – transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces – it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional – someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster – any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces – which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns – Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama – that does happen – but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing – with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction. 

FL -  had first MIA in gulf war which sort of explains things now. 

Spanish version jonah is also expensive on amazon – they are blocking messages they want to eliminate.   Repent or God will killl you is the message of Jonah. 

And when designing a new role playing game it's not really cool that you swipe from my mind what I am writing about and like try to find people who have already designed it – like games that exist that sue a feature I thought up – scratched the back of my head on the word cool in the first line – If coke and pepsi and the rest are so big on proprietary information – they certainly aren't respecting mine – I can;t even get into the computer format stage-  where the ideas go from roughly pencilled notes to being typed up – they're already lifted and people are trying to say - “we'll see they laready did this” - they have failed to show that, but like if you can do that to me, little prevents one from lifting ideas out of other people's heads in say major corporations – and clearly you want a double standard – it is illegal to do it to you – but with someone like me, you'll cheat and you steal it from my head and then claim it's yours.  Like you showed two games that incorporate – the first was a clear-  see she did it first with Battle Galactica, but it sounds a little different than what I have in mind.  Rubbing corners of with thumbs – each thumb on the correct side- touching thumbs as typing -  one part is similar – the other part is not.   The other seemed more friendly and more of a – they might be interested in what you have to say.  But yeah like it's one thing for political but you steal every idea I have even while you are ardent defenders of the patent system which of course becomes rubbish if you can read a person's ideas.  No it's more important than ever – but it's a complete fake – someone does invent things – but the claims could easily be falsified- it becomes fairer not to allow exclusionary claims which will actually prevent theft than allow theft – the person making the exclusionary claim may well be the thief.  Rubbing left eye with left middle finger.  Even in the spell recharge in unearthed arcana not quite what I do.  

I did wake up at 1am last night – but it was momentary – they tried to get me to go to the bathroom – but they didn't have anything more a notion than a need – I went back to sleep and woke 3:40 Est – their power on me is weak – the reason mother and they are so keen to get me out of the house-  the other telepaths have lost the connection and with my changes in appearance or something they can't do what they used to do – they may have gotten photos yesterday.  But yes they can no longer interrupt my  sleep the way they used to.  I do have to walk to the post office to return a package.  I could see if I could call for a pickup.  - also the tongue blisters – that stopped – a few – like in the last couple nights – a few seem to come temporarily – but they too weak – it only lasted like an hour or two.  - coughing – mother can only do so much on her own – and the reason she is key to get me outside is so that other telepaths can help – because right now they are getting neutralized to a large degree- perhaps they are holding – not over several days – the overnights issues are stopping-  during the day when mother is awake is what is left.  - had to rub right cheek and left wrist.  

Methane scrubbing Solar powered polar bear windfarm zoos – an invention for the new year – gets quadruple tax credits and is thus profitable by 2 cents per year of use.   But onhly if you factor in the payback back – the upfront cost is tremendous and the break even point occurs in year 3000.  

-Ah starting to sweat although I am lying on the floor – and just knocked the cup over and had to adjust things and the smell of my feces is wafting to my nose although it shouldn't be that strong anywhere near me – hi mom – try again – I know you will – dribbling sweat onto my makeswift pillow-  19:13 Est 1/3/08 – after or actually while thinking up the blurb above – had the intense need to urinate – held it till finish – but then couldn;t hold it in bathroom  completely until getting to the toilet – and also got the intense need to defecate – not much urination or defecation in the end – left my room quick – usually bring something to work on – a book – writing something in the bathroom – after urinating but before defecating I turn around to find mother climbing the stairs at 18:55 Est to shut the window shades – she usually does that 21:000 or 20:00 she is early and was trying to block me in the bathroom without anything to do so I chose to let thing be partially out in back put my pants back on and run to my bathroom and she was eyeing and checking it out – I can tell monday and if I choose the trek to the post office I cannot avoid could be fun.  They want revenge and I will be vulnerable then.  Unless someone blocks them – theystill hope that they can get under my skin enough to make me want suiciide or to flee or attack them – I remember a prison guard who an inmate dinged a certain way and he went under and committed suicide.   It's like that-  they know with most people there is a limit – a point past which they can't endure- they are hoping to find mine.   A blind search of force now-  it is not one event it is a constant barrage – more in many ways than the past-  wanted to add more – but not sure there was one thought – specific thoguht – one thing they do try suicide and thoughts of fleeing and thoughts of anger – injecting those and see how far they go – I had a few – one 20 minutes ago – right after getting here and thinking can't I do it to her – ooh like a prickle in the air – room shoke – not an earth tremor – odd – but can't I focus on her like she focuses me and sit up here and while she is in bed cause  her body to be wracked pain – as she would do to me – she can't do fully that – she plays with my bladder and rectum and sometimes pain and sometimes forcing me awake-  something I did to the room has allowed sleep – I don;t know – I had good sleep the last couple nights – she doesn't want that to be – maybe a little becasue it is new year's and my normal demons are out partying – gremlins I should say are out partying and are not attacking me like they do – coughed as I started that thought on the gremlins partying.   -  but god tells me I shouldn't try something like that.   I for now agree.   It is like being locked in a cage with a demon.   Or perhap a mind flayer is a more appropriate reference.  - i did rearrange my room today and sge peeked in – why does that help – is their some way to better fight her – should i rearanged my books and furniture before bed – could I effectively lbock them from hurting me at night if I did? - I know you probably know answers – she is not stronger – but she has direct visual and auditory access to me – and tries to use that to beat you  - if I knew what to do – could I fight her better – I get it that you don't want to sue technique – because that can be copied- but just putting up with it all – it drives them crazy – because they believe in dominating and if you refuse to let them domiunate you  - . . . . . .  

I was going to mention – Travolta lost his son – did he intend for me to die in the bathroom in a similar way to his son – did scientology try that? - Tom Cruise – last week -  the CIA has appeared many times recently in ads – which is new – or the increased frequency is new-  and it used to mean every time a death threat against me – and generally with them – it appears – if you attempt to kill someone under their protection – the attempt fails and someone you care aobut suffers a similar fate that you intended for your victim – it is a decent deterrant-  though in my case the attempts have not stopped. 

I'm finally getting – rubbing right edge of lips with right thubma nd burping – I am finally getting that the reason Pittsburgh  hates creativity and hates people who do things differently is not that necessariyl it wants to stop innovation – it just wants full control – like they don't really think the invention – they just don't want the invention because it stops them from controlling if there is another way around them  -it's not fully the intvention they hate – it's the loss of contorl – and they are too shortsighted to see beyond control – they want to box up your options so they can better control what you do – it's not really a moral objection as much as they hide it in that-  it is an objection that they can't control when they  want to – bubonic plague time.

 FOX superscout of the boy scouts who is apparently jewish (here was a last name of a relative given)  and was name dropping Warren Buffet and real estate - “we get to pick who shines” - in which I will reject my home country and file for political asylum in another one – if this is your answer to me 17:48 EST 1/3/09 – you're right I will tire eventually of the arguing game of why I have to keep pleeding for some semblance of justice and I know Obama feels he is going to use my past statements or something to force into jail or a mental institution and  IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE -  I may soon need diplomatic protection from my president from foreign government – swiss used to pass out citizenship to jews in Nazi germany-  I may need something similar.   I wanted something else down but it is forgotten – there were 5 ammendments broken – and its going to get shoved under the carpet -  he said in the interivew the sky is the limit you can be anything you want – and he – just the fact of scouting – which my parents kept me away from – the whole interview was a stab at me – so be it – and the same – this is rude – one of the reporters was the one with the former Israeli ambassador who was not in my opinion – overly diplomatic – no even more than that- or I wanted to say more than that -mother is trying to block it and it is almost tipping back – I will tire and leave this coutnry in time – AH – she was trying to block I got it- I am beginning to think after everything the government has allowed to occurr to me-  perhaps I owe it a challenge – by forcing its hand – if it wants me so much – than I will purposely disqualify myself from the presidency by becoming a foreign citizen so that the only way I could ever run for certain offices is if there were a constitutional ammendment which there should be anyway because the native born thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   I really should be the one planning my own future – and no one has made a convincing argument to the contrary.   I do not like the gaming and there is gaming – there is some need-  but they are hiding behind part of that it appears to get what they want.  And I'm not sure I want that.  I don;t want to make their job overly difficult, but I dont; want to be used either – I don't like he pushed into hero thing – it hasn't worked in the past.   I can mess up bad.  Too many people are enamored with that.  - maybe if I immigrated back you could change my name.  - Give me a new social security number – etc.

the only way I can see HAMAS being less popular is if the Palestinian authority is successful with it's territories and HAMAS appears to have squandered the future of the people – Gaza resembles Darfur including hostilities with the state near it – it's not a perfect resemblance but it is there – Darfur is not a stable situation and without some shift in politics or demographics – shift in demographics bluntly meaning the population changes its face – without one of those – there will not be peace in that region.  The hatred is too strong.   There is a reason HAMAS wins over the PLO- the situation will be interesting to see in 4 months-  or later – with respect if you have a way to make this anymore than a temprorary victory, you are very creative.   By achieving temporary peace the hatred wil foment – even if well-intentioned – no people likes having their government toppled at the will of their neighbor.  Would any of them trade living spaces to somewhere else.  - There is one place – integrate the population.  - And how accurate is Bush's picture? - That HAMAS is fully to blame – integration of the wrong sort will be perceived as trying to further destroy Palestine.   - Israel's moves so far will acheive a “temporary lull” - it will be very difficult to one destroy all HAMAS arms and two prevent HAMS from rearming though I may be wrong on that it depends what they do – but I would think that their actions currently only set up the conditions for a new cycle of violence – unless they add something else.  Again I want to see the situation 3-4 months from now. 

oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly – she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs – I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces – there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes – to rpevent issues-  have to look – of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep – that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com – amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on – the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up – by USPS from home – well this was going to amazon – same place – but I got a no – and I know the other reason why – if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something – of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender – so that eliminates that – what else was I thinking – they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure – it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem – but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com – ah – I wanted to say earlier – the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder – EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT – WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk – that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office – the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself – which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up – you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will – but you shouldn't of and – it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen – especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to – i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary – but we didn't want you to do things the way you were – we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE – SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY – MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED – SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking – and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else – just like bank of america – and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US – that is what is wanted – what I think Barack Obama intends to induce – get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt – while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier – but that is it – it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people – and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs – which isn't all that heavy – it's a rural route – not as rural as could be – but it isn't the city – it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules – I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well – and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine – that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again – putting her pen through it – it was weird – and she was one of theirs – that was the one where when I reported a missing package later – that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me – not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over – just implying it – came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast – there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad “petty” - on youtube – justify my love – like a virgin – Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned – that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example – you'd pull most of your videos – or at least some of the ones I know best – for a material girl – which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority – it's an intersting argument to make – very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09 – I did want to add for some – those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand – not all of them are the songs I like hte best – audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

pasted mail list 2 into hannity.com 11:55 EST 1/3/09


there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes – but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open – there si a reason I don't come out in the open – in fact – all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution – I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it – there is sort of this american – it's best if you don't ahve to hide – we want to see you – BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it – and you are kind of forcing me out into the open – and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result – and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes – yes it would be better in time – it isn't right now – for many reasons people cannot handle it – I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas – not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out – it may ahve been the only way – as I stated a few months ago – so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding – but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful – my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden – but you forced it – and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way – I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done – I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it – I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative – itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone – that may not be possible – but – I am worried that you are a planning a surprise – I don;t want antoher surprise – there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, “Give You Hell”
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects “Give You Hell” and “We Didin't Start the Fire” Billy Joel – Madonna – whether I like her or not – “Just Like a Prayer” – “Move Along” All Aermican Rejects - - “It Ends Tonight” All American Rejects – the Wendy's commercial - “Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show” - in fairness Madonna can do it in others – she can also hide a message in hers – the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it – like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture – for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to – I will a music video – the right one – not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times – until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them – teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing – butyet a music video many things go – the well done ones – I named them up top – or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish – EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy – the backround isn't wasted – the facial expressions aren't wasted – everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society – billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes – to some degree – but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation – a pop up window came up on the “abou” of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that – where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  “because you would have utter choas” - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se – but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not – they do convey messages – but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it – the groupings – I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all – have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe – itching my right knee with right fingers wildly – stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video – but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe – organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements – as I element teaching jobs – it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to “make it cool” - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them – the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.

So we halted war usable item trade with Japan before pearl harbor.  They were attacking other countries to prompt that.   There was apparently from what I saw a detailed plan on

Odd breathing – sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name – though one's married name – she kept her own name – but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me – even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor – what are you doing here? – I might ask ou the same question. 

I don't want – French – no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher – not language – French american – and there weren't many if any French American sudents – both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence – one from France – one in high school and one in CMU – music in elementary school – then 5th grade or 6th she was both years – I am skipping one there – I can't find something he did – things happened around him and were trigered by other children – one time – I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities – but 4 out of the 5 seemed – odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen – and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong – and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course – my failure was planned – and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  “You can do this with every group” - that's just it – no, I can't – it doesn't work with Indian professors – it doesn't work Italians – there are individual – but not 80% - 20% if that – I don't think it works with the Irish – there were some bad experiences – but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est – mother came up starting questioning me through the door – throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus – she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet – though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though – about how dangerous it is – though someone will try to make her seem right – she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with “move along” the song – but used by nice productions – you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong – passed gas as I started writing this – et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps – they don't like it – 8:39 EST 1/3/09 – don't ahve to take a trip to the post office – can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county – he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here – Dupage – no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't – next county over – it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that – have  my mind combine two names – so I can't see – it's partly familar and partly wrong – rubbed right side of face with right middle finger – well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to – but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents – being asked to eat the leftovers – twice in my life – once by the – where did he live northwest chicago – but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh – but he took the metro in – not metro – metra as they are two different systems in Chicago  – I visited there in 2004- the office is gone – but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do – it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004 – someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin – container – deep or potato something – again it seemed out of place – polish –  at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003 – a woman – night shift – but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german – it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean – I do not know what to think on Milan – he was a nexus – saw him twice – he got me out of chicago or his wife did – but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me – he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh – had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire – as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have – and I guess- like he released me – he manueverd my anger and he did – it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time – rubbed left ear with left middle finger – they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people – by race – and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh – I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town – Pittsburgh is a town in many ways – it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't – there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go – I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much – I did drive down to see him in Southwest – I jsut didn't park too well as usual – cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say – about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention – the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully “managed” by other groups in the coutnry – yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU – she probably helped a great deal – was I a test for Pittsburgh – it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon – whatever – was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue – high school and elementary – 2 instances each that I see – high school more – but 2 in elementary – and then Pittsburgh – the thread follows – in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person – but there were in elemenary and high – elemtary into junior – mother's election helper – she is running around now downstaits – I can't trace – Milan? - Chicago – I didn't know the names – the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral – I never suspected.  - 3 – oh wow – 3 – so much of this country hated me – driveways and odd trades – a one time incident – just happened – left no mark – just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me – but people from farther away – it wasn't an accident – none of it was an accident as early as – pretty early – it wasn't accidental – children aren't fully innocent for very long – the same people in one case where one thing happened – they would appear later – much later college from elementary school – I don't know what happens to others – in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random – very few – cause you can trace the same few classmates involved – i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it.  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09 – kfyo – that is a first

btw – trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem – you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009 – DJI Average Dow Jones while up – the chart is bumpy – whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago – the US chart still has zig-zags – smaller ones-  but they are there – and that means fun and games – arbitrage – zig zags help arbitrage – but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton – hi mom . Ligh volume it was said so light arbitrage

Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

netflix – the government movie capital – yes – they have aligned with the children it appears – and they give me ads a lot – banner ads.  

what Japan's legitimate grievances (for WWII) ? – callwer – Nazi prisoners in US got movie passes – uncle didn'ty mention that – great uncle actually – we never met – only stories through parents -  firebombing of Dresden killed civillians – and he said nothing just a laugh – daughter could not drink – it is about the arsenic in the water in TN – which mother let me hear on NPR -  you don't mind it if I can't eat – now your daughter can't drink – amd I bet she can – but it's difficult – do unto others as you want them to do unto you is a Christina comnandment – did you “forget” that one with me ?  - perhaps you are being reminded – God likes that – if you would take away another's hosue than your hosue is taken away if you woudl deprive one of sustenance then yours is taken away.  17:44 EST 1/2/09

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking . There   Military interrogator of foreign military – is the caller.  

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

running around forehead on top of skull as I get to the contact form of the governator.  17:08 EST 1/2/08 – what are you doing new year's eve – design stuff – you

freeing prisonwers to save money – not a bad experiment

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time – the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news – the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh – which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't – I watch those – I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me – the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09 – did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity – true-  things we're still funny in elementary school – why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident – in that wondrous pattern – 2 of those in primary school – in addition the third who hung around mom – not the kid – the mother – less contact with them -  that was and now looks “funny” - and in high school – the car accident – and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school – there is  a funny pattern – not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong – BUT – it is there – both high school and primary school contain - “funny” incidents – where I now go – how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it – isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson – an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil – Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working – NEEDING FUEL – yet the price of gas if under half – there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas – the rascals are still trying to drive that up – givng the political environment of the US – it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now – and then as OPEC cuts production – buy tons of oil contracts – jack the hell out of the oil price again – ship in a polar bear or two to congress – whine global and preach alternative energy policy – the “evil” Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally – or rascally – investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen – the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND – the polar bear comes in – A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy – in Congress – I can see it now

My Brother and Sister Humans and Animals-  god has punished for our sins of using the earth and about our mother planet and he has righteously struck us down with the high heat of global warming as spoken in Absolutely and Expertly truthful movie of “An Inconvenient Truth” - My friends save yourselves and your brother animals by passin' mutli-Trillion dolalr legislation to combat global warming and stop diggin' in the foul center of the earth which is known to be the domain of Satan for that evil oil which is black – and turn to clean, efficient, low cost, and repair free alternative energy – even if we have to put extra mirrors on Mars and Jupiter to getas much as we did from fossil fuels friends, Lord knows it is worth it – Can ya hear the Lord Telling you to Vote for solar Panels and Wind Farms and the several hundred billion or more in Infrastructure costs today friends.  Can ya hear it Now – Can you hear the Lord – Praise the father – Amen to the Father – Amen to alternative energy – Amen – Amen -  and you can help to by writing hefty to checks to the nice people that support me and efforts to convince people of the righteousness of Alternative Energy for there are many sinners just yet still using gas powered lawn mowevers.  Through out your gas guzzlers today and switch to electric alternative enrgy lawn mowevers – and mail the checks 2009comingoftheecofreeakstoDC.org

Drilling in Utah – robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone – of course if you know geology – all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled – no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent – didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years – but land does not stay pristine – that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen – and that can take 10,000 years – so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda – rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that – we hear Robert Redford instead – hmmm.   Not much data on impact either – just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers – no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts – that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong – first weathering – it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone – but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava – it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT – in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly – cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change – os even if it is the same land – it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest – I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls – one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil – these deluded souls who support green technology and “forget” to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff – they had evidence for 10 years – so what I've got about 6 years left – I see.   Not surprised at this point. 





CBS – Shawano WI – hit men for entire town or 60 public officials – Canadian who mentions he has an Italian connection and thus the mofia – and one other things bothered me – they are trying to get better at taking away initial thoughts and mother is doing that more often – hired to kill politicians in a small town – mayor had to stop her open door policy – no – trying to find the other one -they are trying to get expert on taking one thing away from me when I am writing down and they-  did like I got the nudge to write this up write now and not watch other stories – they are testing how well they can make forget a response within in a minute – which was used in court before-  where I couldn;t remember a key point at trial – that I wanted to counter of the doctors.   They are practicing so they always get it right – they get in the ehtnic thing which is from recent and they got in one other thing that is from recent writing - - AH – I got it back – the journalist was the source of evil in the piece – he was a very evil person for what he said the two guys on the street- they were blocking that from me and I got it back – 15:12 EST – 1/4/09 – they are getting an AWFUL lot of practice on me – that is a bad thing and I guess it is nice not to be in court too – but they are trying to focus on making me forget every time – and here it looks like I remembered.   CBS is a communist organization – it is the representative of the group who may have hired the hitman saying that-  that some people think CBS is a communist organization – but it got in the piece – in addition – this was initially the only clip I could see – other than the full news – I talked about how for some reason the window was small – oddly – it is usually larger – so someone gamed it so I see this – I foudn the solution – before I saw this – but looked anyway.  - next – mother just came up after I finished this by 30 seconds – mentioned mice-  she has threatened that with the food here if – it stays in here – I will get a mouse – which happened in Pittsburgh twice.    We'll see. 

cbs seems to have forgotten the scroll bar on its video page – just a coincidence – not a coincidence – well – other associated videos have cropped up that have been helpful and me not seeing any but two of the available videos there unless I am does help prevent that from happening. 

See we scored another shot – cloning is evil – instead of introducing clones – you'll starve half of Africa and South America to death with your solution – I would take gladly “the madness” of cloning anyday – idiocracy.  - yu aren't – I know Japan said coopt the friendly videos – remember that segment like a month ago and they have tried to do it on youtube – and I did rub my face when I said cloning isn't a big deal and it isn't or at least it's not what some religious in the US make it out to be – I did get into a discussion about cloning with the recruiter in 2004 – in Oakland – a brief comment – and he was disapproving – but I defeated his argument – the religious hang up of the military and others with its draw backs – like I will remember to envision the mayan ruler cutting his penis to feed the sungod when I think of your hangups with me in the future – I do feel it comes VERY close to being that stupid.  - next – you left the point to the end though – on hulu.com – good strategy – for various reasons I was sort of prepared for it to go that way.  Clones of the future perhaps “replacing” in time the current ones who like different, but think and act the same way – cuase obviously looking the same but being your own person is far worse than looking different but being compelled and acting the same – I am pretty sure the latter would doom society faster.   The first scenario might actually get the idea to vary the DNA in their place of residence every once in a while – the second gorup won;t.  Scratching left and right sides of face with respective hands and top of head iwth left hand.    I do get that you are chilling and heating my room – or I did suspect that.   - Itching right knee with right fingers.    Last episode of buck rogers on hulu.com. 

and I do get that the objective is to get rid of the USA and upturn the world order which will give strength to the weaker countries – but shor term will cause reat instability and long term will retard the growth of man – someone is trying to later get other countries on top – to do that you have to kill the leader.  But in this caswe it is not just a power struggle – there is a plan behind it. 

11:09 EST mother came up here to tell me we have laundry chute ( where she has lost clothes for several critical weeks) – but it was jus as I was thinking something else – calling me to brag you have a child as a high school roommate and a job and that seemed to be the reason for calling.  - I was looking over what I have of palladium deciding whether or not the larger guides to it are worth putting my savungs on the line or not – the answer is coming back – no – it suffers from middle earth's problem – from I.C.E – Iron crown enterprises – a system that on paper looks good and very detailed and interesting, but in practice will function poorly – too hard to keep track of all the details – rubbed left nostril side with right thumb- palladium is a bad rules system – he wassn't trying to help me – he was trying to cut down on the time I spent doing something else during high school – calling up to bragf later in 2004.  He kept copies of my drawings – the start of the collection – he wasn't a friend – none of them were.   Mother tried to get me down there before – they wanted me down there so people could see me.   And I got fired there – first place in my life.  And he knew the rat fink who ran it – head of the foundation – and the visit from another while in 3rd year in CMU.  - So trust no one is agood motto.  He is an American American as well – several generations.  - Because he used Palladium – they were afraid of the computers.   How many more “smurfs” am I going to see?  Rat fink – very wealthy rat fink – relatively wealthy – local radio show host to CT called him that – that ties it in with another group- all roads lead to the crossroads – uggggghhhhh. - he iniated those games senior year and it was very odd.

seeing finally and it did take me a while – that perhaps the biggest issue that Pittsburgh had with me above all else is that it couldn't control me – that I did get myself into a lifestyle where something couldn't just and take away my freedom and that no one else could push on me and get me to do something I didn't want to do – and they want people in that mode – where they have a mortgage and like a career job and debts that mean they have to live like that OR if an artist that they are tied to a group and to clients that support them – a person who needs little income and has no great debts is not someone you can't control – my student loan is $200 at most and not that currently – if I wanted I could pay it off now – and they gathered that because I paid more than the monthly payment in Pittsburgh – so it's not even really what I said – what I did – etc etc that's the big problem – it is being free and not welded into the system in a way they can push on me.  Forehead resting on first two index fingers – it's blatant political control – many will feel – didn't you get that? – NO – Everything I read says that's not supposed to happen – the employee leaving the door open to the commercial store and the 4 year old got in and played with the toys in the store – Pittsburgh didn't lock the door – and they blame me.   But that anology also implies that any other place will have similar conditions – and I'm sorry that's not fully acceptable to me – in other every one of you is lying about the true circumstances and none of the laws are real, all the regions of the US exercise control like that and you'd do the same Pittsburgh did – where they were trying to push me into a career and a lifestyle I didn't want and so you don;t look at Pittsburgh and say you should never do that – to you it is just – they messed up and don't want to admit it.  So you wouldn't let me write free and clear either.  I don't know – and you're not talking – and even if you were I couldn't believe what you said anyway.   But law isn't really the law if what goes on goes on – it's a tool to use in certain cases, I am – like for control – I'll have to find out and I may not agree with decision and may reject it – but for blatant – just we are supposed to be able to force him to do whatever we want to – and if we can't – we're gonna kill him.  Rubbed bottom of nose with left index knuckle – there is an element of that in my case – not just – hating my ideas and this and that – they don't approve of letting young people wander about on their own – they want control of them and were under the dellusion that they had control of me.    And it's blatant poltical force and power and a community's very strong desire to rule itself with an iron fist – stronger than I ever imagined a human could have- like in ethics and morals-  to me being like that is very immoral – very destructive.   It also only works if you're quiet- because when a stand in for Rush Limbaugh tells me I'm going to the gym – I don;t get that that means mother is coming home with those heavy bags of salt and I will have to haul them – just like in Pittsburgh I missed their cues or only would understand them later.   Where you're saying something and you're not really saying something.   The US is going to have to decide what type of country it is going to be – I am not in a position to make the decision on that- but I will pass judgment as best I can from where I sit and if that carries weight so it does.   To raise me with one set of values my whole life and be lying to me the whole time – well good day.    The Corps the Corps is father and kill anyone who gets in its way – ho ho ho ho ho ho ho – I almost sound like Santa Claus. 

kfyo 8:50 EST 1/4/09 – even this show is interesting – caller with God on a real estate deal – it wasn't through clever economic manuevering – it was the grace of God – we want people deranged and thinking the world runs on strawberry shrotcake so they are easier to manipulate.  Whooppee.

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time – right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly – then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched – 8:13 Est – just can't stop it. Ho ho ho – right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that – and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days – figure out how to do this to people – wow. 

with senator reid a second time – had the wrong thing in the clipbaord – pasted wrong thing first – 8:09 EST 1/4/09.   - pinky on right hand bumped into empty yogurt cup next to it as I decided to go to another senator instead. 

there was a slight touching of my middle and inddex fingers in my left hand -followed by me curling my toes as I decided to write it up as I went back to and emailed mccain.senate.gov 8:07 ESt 1/4/09

and forgot with reid.senate.gov – did not have message ready that I wanted – just the single line forgot to compesate – wrong thing on clipboard when pasting – 7:51 Est 1/4/09 – so I decided to wait and mail him later.  and success - paste error on mccain.senate.gov -2nd time successful - so I won't email either - wait on him 7:53 EST.  Success because it made them do another error - bruth left hand under right under upperarm- by armpit  also as I wrote this up.  - and first try on rove.com but my left thumb still hit my stomach ever so slightly and ti doesn't normally do that.  and the typoing got slow for a moment.  7:58 ESt do it in Rove's window.  Coughing as I switch to the clintonfoundation.  Licked upper lip as I decided to go on t newt.org.   Touched right thumb to right index finger as I pulled up nightlybusiness.org instead. Normally it doesn't happen and I am having issues iwth my lips – touching them.  Touchign index and thumb again on right hand as I went to move off nightly business. 

paste error hutchison.senate.gov 7:48 1/4/09 - 2nd time successful.

the truth potentially – IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show – and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie – maybe not started by him – but he believed that too – that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care – ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY – THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS – IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT – THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO – IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn – they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know – much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds – 20 -30 east flying heading north – I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities – most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example – to make money he or they could just do another movie – or write a book – a charity is not – there is work and cost – like to take people's compalints and research them – even if the idea is to block the complaint – someone has to take and research it – and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it – licking upper lip and now coughing – one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be – that charities are easy money – a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY – THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL – YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months – or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior – there are potential others – a form of of population control – etc etc – in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity – OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class – to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society – really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money – cancer research instead of education funding – making education super expensive – conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end – you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead – I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization – like I can't believe it – it would so not demoncracy – I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces – we can pass any law we want to – I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment – coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going – the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus – the other stimuli did not stimulate well – the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others – then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade – this would include IL too – it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible – transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces – it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional – someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster – any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces – which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns – Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama – that does happen – but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing – with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction. 

FL -  had first MIA in gulf war which sort of explains things now. 

Spanish version jonah is also expensive on amazon – they are blocking messages they want to eliminate.   Repent or God will killl you is the message of Jonah. 

And when designing a new role playing game it's not really cool that you swipe from my mind what I am writing about and like try to find people who have already designed it – like games that exist that sue a feature I thought up – scratched the back of my head on the word cool in the first line – If coke and pepsi and the rest are so big on proprietary information – they certainly aren't respecting mine – I can;t even get into the computer format stage-  where the ideas go from roughly pencilled notes to being typed up – they're already lifted and people are trying to say - “we'll see they laready did this” - they have failed to show that, but like if you can do that to me, little prevents one from lifting ideas out of other people's heads in say major corporations – and clearly you want a double standard – it is illegal to do it to you – but with someone like me, you'll cheat and you steal it from my head and then claim it's yours.  Like you showed two games that incorporate – the first was a clear-  see she did it first with Battle Galactica, but it sounds a little different than what I have in mind.  Rubbing corners of with thumbs – each thumb on the correct side- touching thumbs as typing -  one part is similar – the other part is not.   The other seemed more friendly and more of a – they might be interested in what you have to say.  But yeah like it's one thing for political but you steal every idea I have even while you are ardent defenders of the patent system which of course becomes rubbish if you can read a person's ideas.  No it's more important than ever – but it's a complete fake – someone does invent things – but the claims could easily be falsified- it becomes fairer not to allow exclusionary claims which will actually prevent theft than allow theft – the person making the exclusionary claim may well be the thief.  Rubbing left eye with left middle finger.  Even in the spell recharge in unearthed arcana not quite what I do.  

I did wake up at 1am last night – but it was momentary – they tried to get me to go to the bathroom – but they didn't have anything more a notion than a need – I went back to sleep and woke 3:40 Est – their power on me is weak – the reason mother and they are so keen to get me out of the house-  the other telepaths have lost the connection and with my changes in appearance or something they can't do what they used to do – they may have gotten photos yesterday.  But yes they can no longer interrupt my  sleep the way they used to.  I do have to walk to the post office to return a package.  I could see if I could call for a pickup.  - also the tongue blisters – that stopped – a few – like in the last couple nights – a few seem to come temporarily – but they too weak – it only lasted like an hour or two.  - coughing – mother can only do so much on her own – and the reason she is key to get me outside is so that other telepaths can help – because right now they are getting neutralized to a large degree- perhaps they are holding – not over several days – the overnights issues are stopping-  during the day when mother is awake is what is left.  - had to rub right cheek and left wrist.  

Methane scrubbing Solar powered polar bear windfarm zoos – an invention for the new year – gets quadruple tax credits and is thus profitable by 2 cents per year of use.   But onhly if you factor in the payback back – the upfront cost is tremendous and the break even point occurs in year 3000.  

-Ah starting to sweat although I am lying on the floor – and just knocked the cup over and had to adjust things and the smell of my feces is wafting to my nose although it shouldn't be that strong anywhere near me – hi mom – try again – I know you will – dribbling sweat onto my makeswift pillow-  19:13 Est 1/3/08 – after or actually while thinking up the blurb above – had the intense need to urinate – held it till finish – but then couldn;t hold it in bathroom  completely until getting to the toilet – and also got the intense need to defecate – not much urination or defecation in the end – left my room quick – usually bring something to work on – a book – writing something in the bathroom – after urinating but before defecating I turn around to find mother climbing the stairs at 18:55 Est to shut the window shades – she usually does that 21:000 or 20:00 she is early and was trying to block me in the bathroom without anything to do so I chose to let thing be partially out in back put my pants back on and run to my bathroom and she was eyeing and checking it out – I can tell monday and if I choose the trek to the post office I cannot avoid could be fun.  They want revenge and I will be vulnerable then.  Unless someone blocks them – theystill hope that they can get under my skin enough to make me want suiciide or to flee or attack them – I remember a prison guard who an inmate dinged a certain way and he went under and committed suicide.   It's like that-  they know with most people there is a limit – a point past which they can't endure- they are hoping to find mine.   A blind search of force now-  it is not one event it is a constant barrage – more in many ways than the past-  wanted to add more – but not sure there was one thought – specific thoguht – one thing they do try suicide and thoughts of fleeing and thoughts of anger – injecting those and see how far they go – I had a few – one 20 minutes ago – right after getting here and thinking can't I do it to her – ooh like a prickle in the air – room shoke – not an earth tremor – odd – but can't I focus on her like she focuses me and sit up here and while she is in bed cause  her body to be wracked pain – as she would do to me – she can't do fully that – she plays with my bladder and rectum and sometimes pain and sometimes forcing me awake-  something I did to the room has allowed sleep – I don;t know – I had good sleep the last couple nights – she doesn't want that to be – maybe a little becasue it is new year's and my normal demons are out partying – gremlins I should say are out partying and are not attacking me like they do – coughed as I started that thought on the gremlins partying.   -  but god tells me I shouldn't try something like that.   I for now agree.   It is like being locked in a cage with a demon.   Or perhap a mind flayer is a more appropriate reference.  - i did rearrange my room today and sge peeked in – why does that help – is their some way to better fight her – should i rearanged my books and furniture before bed – could I effectively lbock them from hurting me at night if I did? - I know you probably know answers – she is not stronger – but she has direct visual and auditory access to me – and tries to use that to beat you  - if I knew what to do – could I fight her better – I get it that you don't want to sue technique – because that can be copied- but just putting up with it all – it drives them crazy – because they believe in dominating and if you refuse to let them domiunate you  - . . . . . .  

I was going to mention – Travolta lost his son – did he intend for me to die in the bathroom in a similar way to his son – did scientology try that? - Tom Cruise – last week -  the CIA has appeared many times recently in ads – which is new – or the increased frequency is new-  and it used to mean every time a death threat against me – and generally with them – it appears – if you attempt to kill someone under their protection – the attempt fails and someone you care aobut suffers a similar fate that you intended for your victim – it is a decent deterrant-  though in my case the attempts have not stopped. 

I'm finally getting – rubbing right edge of lips with right thubma nd burping – I am finally getting that the reason Pittsburgh  hates creativity and hates people who do things differently is not that necessariyl it wants to stop innovation – it just wants full control – like they don't really think the invention – they just don't want the invention because it stops them from controlling if there is another way around them  -it's not fully the intvention they hate – it's the loss of contorl – and they are too shortsighted to see beyond control – they want to box up your options so they can better control what you do – it's not really a moral objection as much as they hide it in that-  it is an objection that they can't control when they  want to – bubonic plague time.

 FOX superscout of the boy scouts who is apparently jewish (here was a last name of a relative given)  and was name dropping Warren Buffet and real estate - “we get to pick who shines” - in which I will reject my home country and file for political asylum in another one – if this is your answer to me 17:48 EST 1/3/09 – you're right I will tire eventually of the arguing game of why I have to keep pleeding for some semblance of justice and I know Obama feels he is going to use my past statements or something to force into jail or a mental institution and  IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE -  I may soon need diplomatic protection from my president from foreign government – swiss used to pass out citizenship to jews in Nazi germany-  I may need something similar.   I wanted something else down but it is forgotten – there were 5 ammendments broken – and its going to get shoved under the carpet -  he said in the interivew the sky is the limit you can be anything you want – and he – just the fact of scouting – which my parents kept me away from – the whole interview was a stab at me – so be it – and the same – this is rude – one of the reporters was the one with the former Israeli ambassador who was not in my opinion – overly diplomatic – no even more than that- or I wanted to say more than that -mother is trying to block it and it is almost tipping back – I will tire and leave this coutnry in time – AH – she was trying to block I got it- I am beginning to think after everything the government has allowed to occurr to me-  perhaps I owe it a challenge – by forcing its hand – if it wants me so much – than I will purposely disqualify myself from the presidency by becoming a foreign citizen so that the only way I could ever run for certain offices is if there were a constitutional ammendment which there should be anyway because the native born thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   I really should be the one planning my own future – and no one has made a convincing argument to the contrary.   I do not like the gaming and there is gaming – there is some need-  but they are hiding behind part of that it appears to get what they want.  And I'm not sure I want that.  I don;t want to make their job overly difficult, but I dont; want to be used either – I don't like he pushed into hero thing – it hasn't worked in the past.   I can mess up bad.  Too many people are enamored with that.  - maybe if I immigrated back you could change my name.  - Give me a new social security number – etc.

the only way I can see HAMAS being less popular is if the Palestinian authority is successful with it's territories and HAMAS appears to have squandered the future of the people – Gaza resembles Darfur including hostilities with the state near it – it's not a perfect resemblance but it is there – Darfur is not a stable situation and without some shift in politics or demographics – shift in demographics bluntly meaning the population changes its face – without one of those – there will not be peace in that region.  The hatred is too strong.   There is a reason HAMAS wins over the PLO- the situation will be interesting to see in 4 months-  or later – with respect if you have a way to make this anymore than a temprorary victory, you are very creative.   By achieving temporary peace the hatred wil foment – even if well-intentioned – no people likes having their government toppled at the will of their neighbor.  Would any of them trade living spaces to somewhere else.  - There is one place – integrate the population.  - And how accurate is Bush's picture? - That HAMAS is fully to blame – integration of the wrong sort will be perceived as trying to further destroy Palestine.   - Israel's moves so far will acheive a “temporary lull” - it will be very difficult to one destroy all HAMAS arms and two prevent HAMS from rearming though I may be wrong on that it depends what they do – but I would think that their actions currently only set up the conditions for a new cycle of violence – unless they add something else.  Again I want to see the situation 3-4 months from now. 

oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly – she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs – I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces – there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes – to rpevent issues-  have to look – of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep – that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com – amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on – the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up – by USPS from home – well this was going to amazon – same place – but I got a no – and I know the other reason why – if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something – of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender – so that eliminates that – what else was I thinking – they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure – it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem – but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com – ah – I wanted to say earlier – the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder – EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT – WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk – that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office – the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself – which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up – you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will – but you shouldn't of and – it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen – especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to – i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary – but we didn't want you to do things the way you were – we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE – SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY – MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED – SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking – and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else – just like bank of america – and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US – that is what is wanted – what I think Barack Obama intends to induce – get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt – while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier – but that is it – it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people – and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs – which isn't all that heavy – it's a rural route – not as rural as could be – but it isn't the city – it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules – I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well – and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine – that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again – putting her pen through it – it was weird – and she was one of theirs – that was the one where when I reported a missing package later – that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me – not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over – just implying it – came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast – there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad “petty” - on youtube – justify my love – like a virgin – Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned – that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example – you'd pull most of your videos – or at least some of the ones I know best – for a material girl – which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority – it's an intersting argument to make – very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09 – I did want to add for some – those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand – not all of them are the songs I like hte best – audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

pasted mail list 2 into hannity.com 11:55 EST 1/3/09


there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes – but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open – there si a reason I don't come out in the open – in fact – all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution – I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it – there is sort of this american – it's best if you don't ahve to hide – we want to see you – BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it – and you are kind of forcing me out into the open – and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result – and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes – yes it would be better in time – it isn't right now – for many reasons people cannot handle it – I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas – not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out – it may ahve been the only way – as I stated a few months ago – so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding – but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful – my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden – but you forced it – and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way – I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done – I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it – I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative – itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone – that may not be possible – but – I am worried that you are a planning a surprise – I don;t want antoher surprise – there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, “Give You Hell”
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects “Give You Hell” and “We Didin't Start the Fire” Billy Joel – Madonna – whether I like her or not – “Just Like a Prayer” – “Move Along” All Aermican Rejects - - “It Ends Tonight” All American Rejects – the Wendy's commercial - “Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show” - in fairness Madonna can do it in others – she can also hide a message in hers – the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it – like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture – for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to – I will a music video – the right one – not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times – until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them – teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing – butyet a music video many things go – the well done ones – I named them up top – or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish – EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy – the backround isn't wasted – the facial expressions aren't wasted – everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society – billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes – to some degree – but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation – a pop up window came up on the “abou” of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that – where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  “because you would have utter choas” - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se – but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not – they do convey messages – but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it – the groupings – I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all – have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe – itching my right knee with right fingers wildly – stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video – but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe – organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements – as I element teaching jobs – it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to “make it cool” - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them – the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.  
hit he “end” key and didn't mean to 11:28 Est

Chicago he did have me prepare a graphic presentation – and then CCAC 2002.

So we halted war usable item trade with Japan before pearl harbor.  They were attacking other countries to prompt that.   There was apparently from what I saw a detailed plan on

Odd breathing – sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name – though one's married name – she kept her own name – but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me – even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor – what are you doing here? – I might ask ou the same question. 

I don't want – French – no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher – not language – French american – and there weren't many if any French American sudents – both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence – one from France – one in high school and one in CMU – music in elementary school – then 5th grade or 6th she was both years – I am skipping one there – I can't find something he did – things happened around him and were trigered by other children – one time – I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities – but 4 out of the 5 seemed – odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen – and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong – and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course – my failure was planned – and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  “You can do this with every group” - that's just it – no, I can't – it doesn't work with Indian professors – it doesn't work Italians – there are individual – but not 80% - 20% if that – I don't think it works with the Irish – there were some bad experiences – but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est – mother came up starting questioning me through the door – throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus – she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet – though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though – about how dangerous it is – though someone will try to make her seem right – she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with “move along” the song – but used by nice productions – you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong – passed gas as I started writing this – et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps – they don't like it – 8:39 EST 1/3/09 – don't ahve to take a trip to the post office – can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county – he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here – Dupage – no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't – next county over – it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that – have  my mind combine two names – so I can't see – it's partly familar and partly wrong – rubbed right side of face with right middle finger – well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to – but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents – being asked to eat the leftovers – twice in my life – once by the – where did he live northwest chicago – but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh – but he took the metro in – not metro – metra as they are two different systems in Chicago  – I visited there in 2004- the office is gone – but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do – it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004 – someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin – container – deep or potato something – again it seemed out of place – polish –  at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003 – a woman – night shift – but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german – it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean – I do not know what to think on Milan – he was a nexus – saw him twice – he got me out of chicago or his wife did – but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me – he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh – had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire – as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have – and I guess- like he released me – he manueverd my anger and he did – it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time – rubbed left ear with left middle finger – they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people – by race – and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh – I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town – Pittsburgh is a town in many ways – it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't – there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go – I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much – I did drive down to see him in Southwest – I jsut didn't park too well as usual – cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say – about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention – the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully “managed” by other groups in the coutnry – yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU – she probably helped a great deal – was I a test for Pittsburgh – it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon – whatever – was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue – high school and elementary – 2 instances each that I see – high school more – but 2 in elementary – and then Pittsburgh – the thread follows – in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person – but there were in elemenary and high – elemtary into junior – mother's election helper – she is running around now downstaits – I can't trace – Milan? - Chicago – I didn't know the names – the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral – I never suspected.  - 3 – oh wow – 3 – so much of this country hated me – driveways and odd trades – a one time incident – just happened – left no mark – just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me – but people from farther away – it wasn't an accident – none of it was an accident as early as – pretty early – it wasn't accidental – children aren't fully innocent for very long – the same people in one case where one thing happened – they would appear later – much later college from elementary school – I don't know what happens to others – in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random – very few – cause you can trace the same few classmates involved – i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it.  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09 – kfyo – that is a first

btw – trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem – you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009 – DJI Average Dow Jones while up – the chart is bumpy – whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago – the US chart still has zig-zags – smaller ones-  but they are there – and that means fun and games – arbitrage – zig zags help arbitrage – but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton – hi mom . Ligh volume it was said so light arbitrage

Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

netflix – the government movie capital – yes – they have aligned with the children it appears – and they give me ads a lot – banner ads.  

what Japan's legitimate grievances (for WWII) ? – callwer – Nazi prisoners in US got movie passes – uncle didn'ty mention that – great uncle actually – we never met – only stories through parents -  firebombing of Dresden killed civillians – and he said nothing just a laugh – daughter could not drink – it is about the arsenic in the water in TN – which mother let me hear on NPR -  you don't mind it if I can't eat – now your daughter can't drink – amd I bet she can – but it's difficult – do unto others as you want them to do unto you is a Christina comnandment – did you “forget” that one with me ?  - perhaps you are being reminded – God likes that – if you would take away another's hosue than your hosue is taken away if you woudl deprive one of sustenance then yours is taken away.  17:44 EST 1/2/09

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking . There   Military interrogator of foreign military – is the caller.  

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

running around forehead on top of skull as I get to the contact form of the governator.  17:08 EST 1/2/08 – what are you doing new year's eve – design stuff – you

freeing prisonwers to save money – not a bad experiment

pain in thumb – left hand – like sprained thumb – but ot didn't connect.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


--
Allen Hunt 18:14 ESt

It is important for America to come together – Backy – that is the line that scares me – with him that means – you may disagree with me – I ma holding a gun to your head buddy – come together with me and work with me or else – that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president – no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen – that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer – um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person – should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue – it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be – and that is regrettable. 

I forgot Rex -

and a little spider came down from the ceiling as I wrote the section below – spinning a line down between me and my computer – very small spider. 

from movie critic to music video critic -
I guess I will say this it does apply to both groups that I saw – maybe a group and a person – I made the  comment on using a video to tell a story – music video to tell a story – there is some difference between what both of you are doing and what the groups I named are doing – there videos are “tighter” - the graphic story being told takes precedence over the performance – NOW IT IS COMMON WITH LOGICAL COHERENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE A PERFORMANCE COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE STORY LINE IN THE VIDEO AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE GOOD DO THAT – “they give you hell, hope it gives you hell”  – they perform when they are artists in the video – logical placement – it's sort of like product placement but you are placing yourself-  but it is done in character -  other groups like to have the performance throughout, but not in places where it fully lends itself to the story they are trying to tell on the video  – in a recent video and in this group's case – the themes in the videos are getting stronger – the story is stronger as the group gets older-  shall we say it's not the worst thing to have  that happen – but if I compare you on that idea – of STICKING TO THE SCRIPT – you have lines in your song – that don't directly reference graphically in the video – if you talk abou all this stuff in a mall – that feeling of all this stuff should carry on the video and in that place it gets abstracted and is a weak reference – if one of the singers is singing the part about a character at the mall – but she is performing and acting like a musical performer when that is not what she is singing about – that is logically inconsistent – that is another issue – IF you want to do this or want a video structured this way – when you jump it has to be logical – We didn;t start the fire has 4-5 different sets – jumps many times – and to a coffin – the jumps are very carefully thought out and I bet if I look referenced to song breaks – others like weird spacey shots in the middle of meaningful lines- and start off a theme of being a food court – and there is a mugging or theft – but it isn't perfectly clear what is going and then it jumps out of that scene – make the point and THEN jump out – and like if you built in – on the strong end theme of the song – sort of mall excess-  you build in vignettes in the mall excesses-  it can be corny and fun and zany it just has to aid the punchline which there is one at the end – but not all of what is shown up to that aids in building to that punchline -  like put the space stuff on the TV screen in the mall or maybe some fountain or display piece – the zany stuff could even be a cue at the end of each scene – it doesn't have to be disappear – just be placed and located better and look like you control the script versus pieces seem uncontrolled – that is the main difference – that and you jump in such a way that the story line can;t fully logically function and the ones I mention before do not do that.  And you can do wacky stuff like ride a bike through the mall – but what happens around the bike and and where the bike goes should relate to the song and what is being sung – it only loosely does that. 

– that is the idea-  you also put in pieces of you just singing when it's not chorus and they are substantive lines – description in the song – which disrupts continuity in getting into a story  If you want a tighter video – you may not – you like sort of zany theme where it doesn' fully come together

  - Someone else was trying to do that with a ship and a movie  – If that is your point – –– If you do want a video more to the story of the song versus an outtake of a performance - when you sing in the video it has to make sense in the story –you sing in a separate shot from the clips of the movie -  if you are sang to the lover on the side in certain places while the action is moving but the romantic male lead is doing something – like you are singing to him as he is in a picture frame moving through action and then the scene changes  - that would work and the singer is the narrator  your song sort of lends itself to you being a narrator and a moment maybe frozen or minimized again in a picture frame on screen while the words and the singer become prominent and then scene change and story is full – singer is hidden – it's that type of song and lends itself to that.  Versus the jar of one moment story and the next singer – they are two separate worlds – never mixed at all and it's a video – they should be intertwined.  Liked that movie and I liked the song above. 
For the song above before that – you could have security cams in the mall as the scene changer like end each mini-scene with like the eye of a security cam and go into it for the next scene – or use that for one scene – a Tv for another one – like that – where does the wackiness come from – and both of those could be somewhat logical places.  Like on pleasure seeker – at a cosmetics booth with free samples – at the food court getting free samples-  in a mirror trying on dresses or whatever else – using different things sold at the mall – one cool way – start with one and like put it in a video lense and like add one lense and then add 2 lense – each lense the same singer but seeking pleasure in a different way and at end of that section zoom into new lense and new part of the mall and start next scene.   - for singing the video – Tv screens music covers – even a digital picture frame or a computer laptop these days.  Or soemthing odder like the crystal ball of a fortune teller or maybe in one of the gumball machines.  - just soem thoughts cheers. 


there was an ad on hulu.co m for a website on education – not council ad2go.comm – that is not perfect – ti was like a gladitorial arena – but with people representing subjects and one even had equations on his body – pitting knowledge as sort of fighting for knowledge – but sort of a takeoff on the advice I gave on learning lessons from rock videos and applying it to education – of course this was not truly done with intent – just a commercial that seems to be a takeoff on something I said a day ago on hulu.com today 1/4/09 – that stuff happens so often I stop recording it – they had skeletons of a pair of gladiators at one point for like biology.  - but again not truly to educate – and an ad for a website – ho ho.  + - passed gas while writing this. 

accidentally put the email list #5 on boortz.com – forgot what was on clipboard – had dinner – ro brought up dinner to have – and that assisted my forgetfulness – rubbed back right side with right thumb and the did something else as I wrote this up.  16:27EST 1/4/09

part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time – the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news – the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh – which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't – I watch those – I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me – the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09 – did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity – true-  things we're still funny in elementary school – why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident – in that wondrous pattern – 2 of those in primary school – in addition the third who hung around mom – not the kid – the mother – less contact with them -  that was and now looks “funny” - and in high school – the car accident – and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school – there is  a funny pattern – not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong – BUT – it is there – both high school and primary school contain - “funny” incidents – where I now go – how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it – isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson – an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil – Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working – NEEDING FUEL – yet the price of gas if under half – there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas – the rascals are still trying to drive that up – givng the political environment of the US – it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now – and then as OPEC cuts production – buy tons of oil contracts – jack the hell out of the oil price again – ship in a polar bear or two to congress – whine global and preach alternative energy policy – the “evil” Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally – or rascally – investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen – the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND – the polar bear comes in – A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy – in Congress – I can see it now

My Brother and Sister Humans and Animals-  god has punished for our sins of using the earth and about our mother planet and he has righteously struck us down with the high heat of global warming as spoken in Absolutely and Expertly truthful movie of “An Inconvenient Truth” - My friends save yourselves and your brother animals by passin' mutli-Trillion dolalr legislation to combat global warming and stop diggin' in the foul center of the earth which is known to be the domain of Satan for that evil oil which is black – and turn to clean, efficient, low cost, and repair free alternative energy – even if we have to put extra mirrors on Mars and Jupiter to getas much as we did from fossil fuels friends, Lord knows it is worth it – Can ya hear the Lord Telling you to Vote for solar Panels and Wind Farms and the several hundred billion or more in Infrastructure costs today friends.  Can ya hear it Now – Can you hear the Lord – Praise the father – Amen to the Father – Amen to alternative energy – Amen – Amen -  and you can help to by writing hefty to checks to the nice people that support me and efforts to convince people of the righteousness of Alternative Energy for there are many sinners just yet still using gas powered lawn mowevers.  Through out your gas guzzlers today and switch to electric alternative enrgy lawn mowevers – and mail the checks 2009comingoftheecofreeakstoDC.org

Drilling in Utah – robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone – of course if you know geology – all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled – no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent – didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years – but land does not stay pristine – that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen – and that can take 10,000 years – so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda – rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that – we hear Robert Redford instead – hmmm.   Not much data on impact either – just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers – no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts – that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong – first weathering – it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone – but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava – it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT – in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly – cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change – os even if it is the same land – it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest – I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls – one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil – these deluded souls who support green technology and “forget” to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff – they had evidence for 10 years – so what I've got about 6 years left – I see.   Not surprised at this point.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

Allen Hunt 18:14 ESt

are u joking about the repeat loop errors - you seem to be repeating slightly and I am scared of that happening - those bloody error.s

separate but equal wasn't that decided in board of education ? - that is the issue with legal marriage – marriage is being redefined legally not in a religious sense and the religions do not hold sway legally.  The legal definition of marriage should comply with other laws of the country and not discriminate. 

Obama – we're not going to agree on every single issue – disagree without being disagreeable – um during the Bush years – his detractors were not disagreeable while disagreeing – get the conservative talk show host reeducation center ready and I will be put on Risperdal -  you cannot really disagree without being disagreeable – you won;t be honest- midwesterners aren't – they made Barack Obama – and that is not a good thing – complete fiction -  the midwestern way – it's flaw are on display right now. 

should preachers be at a presidential ceremony – no – not really – should be a judge – not at the oath or  whatever – it is more Christian than not – reflective moment perhaps

Wesley sleep program – autistic son iwth medication – oh yes you are in the mark levin commercial traditon – I see – kfyo 18:19 Est

It is important for America to come together – Backy – that is the line that scares me – with him that means – you may disagree with me – I ma holding a gun to your head buddy – come together with me and work with me or else – that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president – no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen – that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer – um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person – should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue – it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be – and that is regrettable. 

I forgot Rex -

Gay people can be for gay lifestyle-  caller  can speak out against it-  but do gay people get ssame rights – that is where the line is – do you recognize that?  - radical gays better watch – get straight community upset – so the radical gays better watch what they say – ah that pesky 1st ammendment is being burned and I am wlaking into a trap – just like the second phrase in this paragraph – all rights should be taken with good ethics – which gets rid of inappropriate outbursts – where there are some – the law handles them and not other people “deciding” soemthing should not go on – that idea is what is a problem – that you can decide what is inappropriate for your neighbor without going through recongized channels -  people don't think the legal thing applies jsut lena on your neighbor until they get the message and that is illegal – but it is done. 

Jake – Obama's choice- we elected him to be our leader not our puppet-  manchuria candidate -

Oprah can't get a ticket to the inauguration?????? - wow

couldn't find a person everyone would agree with – I bet you could – some english commentator-  not Brit – writer – Oprah would be a good choice for pastor for the nation – bill cosby -

Rick warren – brin civility – sounds li9ke Obama – is it at gunpoint we have civility -the ministry of peace in babylon 5?

at the inauguration – for preachers okay – giving inaugural portions – no

american who happens to be gay – not important the pastor- she is lying or not real – and she emphasized Bush thrown out – she is a palnt – not authentic at least.   18:42 Est – Janet

it is odd Obama could not have pciked someone more palatable to the gay community for the inaugural when you put it that way – I hand't thought about it. 

ahteists at 2% - that community is growing very quickly – then – 1.4% in 2001 non-denominational – atheists and everyone else.

Jay- I think =- how are u – saying positive – for gays – but no problem with pastors at inauguration  - not necessarily intolerance -  it's overestimating the importance of this – it says a lot about application of constitution -  you don't seem to want me to write anymore allen – so I won't – this guy is clever – several things I could write – but same as others

Eric – if I were gay I'd be happy – missed that till allen says it – are u born atheist – wow  - you're not  born a christian

Rick O'warren

so it was gremlins in my tummy – ho ho

rubbed right ear as I get ready for allen -

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

--
60 Minutes – the wire for my keyboard is loose – I should have a still working spare and this one still works – yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer – it is “odd” how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV – itching – left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth – I was feeling aversion to writing this up – it is going now – maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney – said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time – my old license pla from Chicago – someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there – worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer – neat trick – the lights do blink – num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like – happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate – NY Prosecutor “deterring” drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder – this is a highly troubling story – and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems – the rammifications are not so simple – I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver – but as I cough up a little phlegm – here's the thing on this – I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude – bury him under the court – very vengeful – and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that – Someone is cackling somewhere – because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone – and that is the point – BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be – we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one – you can't win – be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink – he or she wasn'tr thinking – they lost control of the vehicle – and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case – a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident – the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown – it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent – to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case – you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women – but men may drink more – be expected to drink in more situations – I don;t know the stats – but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink – I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving – But the issues is – drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to – unless . . . .. intent can be determined – which in honesty even right now I bet it can – but not in a way that is admissable in court – but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing – the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink – it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk – that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along – he always made a big deal about that – I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish – when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me – it bristled me quite a bit – today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt – but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while – it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in – it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me – my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years – but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner – and I wouldn't have ordered there without him “meniktoning” it to me – and I didn't like – food was fine – it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk – I know with drugs – a professor bascially endorsed it by being there – and also smoking – it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving – second one – with brownies – funny brownies – I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor – we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it – again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases – with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs – and that is the big problem – oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs – and they probably could if they wanted to somehow – but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading – it has been done for quite a well – but we are talking about CMU – and trusting the wizards of CMU – DON'T – at least not at first – while brain patterns may be critical – I see a flaw in the study – but the premise can brain patterns be read – from my experience it certainly appears so – so the premise is not fully flawed – there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues – do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful – to me – I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003 – there was a MRI of my brain – well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005 – like in 2002 or 2003 – there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff – but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test – the computer images didn't come up – and the person – female – dark hair – did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial – the data was wasted – because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons – like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B – C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study – because my data was thrown out – yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that – MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes – though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking – school pyschologist at CCAC – in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution – we were talkign about medication – he used the phrase won't you try a little bit – and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me – on Dec 23 2005 – used the same phrase – won;t you try a little bit – when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no – in the emergency room – I did not say not – and I said maybe and maybe even yes – because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them – that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor – that female – reminded me of Jessica Lynch – from DAM – odd thing there.  Just a coincidence. 

But now maybe that I have shown how CMU helped me – perhaps I should help CMU – I am scared of these guys – Do they encourage the thought of window from the same picture-  because they said they generically know the brain pattern of window thought – what parts of the brain a person will use for window for any person – yet they haven't tried every stimulus or even a corpus of stimuli to indcue the thought of window – touching a window in a natural setting  may send a very different brain signal than the black and white image of window used – do different pictures of window have the same brain location – the word window – hearing it – hearing the sound of a double hung window being shut – they ahve those in Pittsburgh – mother got awning windows in this house oddly which the hurricane shutters on the top floor block from opening because of the low ceilings – 8 foot versus the builder wanted 9 foot – that does not seem to be accidental.  - but the good people at CMU – should not say they know a generic pattern of thought – their data is too preliminary – with just using the same picture.    Their time horizon is very optimistic for a machine that can fully read someone's mind – I can be wrong – but no one who is deceiving the machine – not a test where subject  can think about any object from any reference they have at least as a grounding should be there – the technology will not be 100% accurate from what they have shown – or that iws not proven and I worry about using that as court evidence for a while – I think it might be like cancer drugs.   We'll see a few of them come and go.    CMU is getting more corrupt – or corrupted by powerful money – it was while  I was there – odd to have CMU and Texas Tech together in 60 minutes.  - Rubbing back neck after touch by both eyes – index knuckle bottom to right cheekbone top and index finger to left, left eye edge and palm on neck all with right hand 

Texas Tech Football – fairy tale brings NFL money and influence – I don't want to talk about the Texas Tech football team – I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons - - oh my keyboard just blinked – ho oho – but I guess we are switching things a bit – Okay with that done let's talk D &D – The Zhentarim are presented i nthe way Dugneons and Dragons presents evil where for the most part the villain just wants to eventually get you onto a torture wrack and take al lyour magical items – but the Zhentarim in the Forgotten Realms setting do build a network of spies in smaller towns like Shadodale – home of Elminster the Seer – the most pwoerful I think mage in Faerun as Forgotten Realms is called-  Elminster moves to Faerun(Shadowdale) after many adventures he isn't born there – it isn't the size of Saerloon i nthe summer which if I remeber reaches over 200,000 but defintiely not quite 300,000 just yet – Saerloon is something like that in its prime seasons.  But we are talking about shadowdale and the zhentarim like having a network of spies but being in dungeons and dragons they're evil and pose as shady merchants, only occassionally do you see villain in D &D get real villain smarts and like totally infiltrate a good com munity posing as something they're not – polymorph others spells and many to later one's appearance do exist And definitely in Zhentil keep in one time period 2 Devils pose as a ruling couple of humans and no one knows their disguise within Zhentil Kepp for a long time.   - Coughing as I write that-  nearly lopped off my right big toe toenail with my left heel  pushing up on nail as I crossed my feet.   Gelatine from gummy bears does get your toenails to grow doesn't it Haven't had to clip them in months.  What did mother give me oh -  and she bought precisely two boxes of gelatine – jello – that is the other reason forsmall amounts of food – she controls dosages of nturients like medicine – rubbing left side of face with left hand as I write that and hir cheeck with palm and top of head left side in hair with fingers.  Wasn't an even rub.   Oh this is such a good horror movie.   Dropped this keyboard a little – common theme that – gget distracted for a minute – thinking about buying used versus buying new stuff at amazon and high school and looking up one of the people from elementary school yesterday online like I did antoher classmate – get into loop of thought – get out of it and rub left corner of motuh with left thubm – pass gas as I write that up  -touched thumbs as I identified ti as a loop of thought – but Zhentil keep is not like Sauron in the second age – where he comes as the bearer of gifts and good tidings and comes into the isle of Numenor as a fair person and only slowly corrupts them – this is before the war of the ring series by a thousand years or so – Second age – war of the ring ends the third age.  Mother is up 6:31 EST can hear her moving downstairs.  Biting into hand another pimple or small scab on hand – whitehead on my right thigh last night – they had mostly healed for a while – back to story -  there aren't many athletic contests within Dungeons and Dragons – jousting is mentioned in the C – it'sbeing blocked – before Imortals and Master  -but after Basic and Expert – I want to say Companion – that's not it – it is Companion – in the Companion series  they do talk of jousting and hosting a jjousting tournament as a noble lord – and rules on that.  Rubbed all around head as I began to suspcet that ti was companion - - nwo a yawn – they do nto want me to write this one – it is funny to watch this – and not so funny – but In Dungeons and Dragons at least in the rule book one doesn't getting into how to maximize revenue from a joust very much – of course in the model given – the lord or owner pays for the peasants to come to the joust and ti is  means to keep them happy – no lord invented the idea of makiing the peasants pay for their own holiday.  And yes agian no one thought of how to maximize revenue or attendance and interest in a jousting tourfnament in Dungoens and Dragons – it just isn't that important to other goals of the companion set such as the eventually goal of some charctgers to battle with the monsters in the world or other issues – jousting is far down the list much of the time.  We probably don't get into the idea of fairytale jousting tournaments and their imapct on peasant interest in jousting because of course dungeons and dragons si a fairy tale and the idea of the little prince being crowned king is quite easy to produce in dungeons and dragons and doesn't have to be faked and managed to happen – it happens all the time – in fact is boring and we moved on to crowinging the dark elf rebel as a noble above ground.  
That was one thing I wanted to get into – antoher – ya know when looking over Palladium and Rolemaster or middle earth both of which use the same gaming system – from Iron Crown Enterprises – one would wonder why the company is named after the Iron Crown of Morgoth – details details – but all three of those games have like 8 to ten attributes to describe a cahracters basic abilities unlike dungeons and dragons which has 6 – and therein actually USED to lie its beauty – it relatively simple game mechanics and then too many physicist and experts on hand to hand combat got together and now  apaprently in the 3rd edition there was a rules compendium put togehter just for the different – AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH – and it won appeal originally on its simplicity even if its depictions of combat weren't perfectly realistic – your fighter can take more damage than four warhorses – really ?  - but I digress – attributes I was focusing on attributes six attributes of dungeons and dragons – in particular things have shifted over the years – but I didn't want to get into the full history – instead – in Dungeons and Dragons when evaluating a person's mental abilities – the psionicist for example – intelligence over the ability to analyze data quickly is not just one stat – or being intelligent is not just one stat – it is actually 2 if not 3 stats – maybe even 4.   There is of course Intelligences which would be the stat that would be used in analyzing and calculating so many calcualtions per second or seeing a pattern and the raw recognition of a pattern or the many movements and getting to a pattern that would be under the attribute of intelligence – what used to be and still the traditional needed stat to be a wizard – of course in the third they introduced sorcerers who cast wizard spells but usede Charisma as the prime stat for their power and not intelligence or raw number crunching.  Charisma has changed over the years as it is hard to define – my definition currently may not fully match the games either – it used to sort of be good looks – it is definitely at first the characteristic a football coach would possess that drive and passion that can be used to sway the audience – but in current editions it has changed – and in 3rd edition I think – Charisma became more like Wisdom used to be and the drive the force of will – that became part of charisma's protfolio as an attribute – which is not there in the 1st edition – but it is there now and having a high Charisma is necessary to being a sorcerer.  Many sorcerers in the game tend to be loners it is noted here.  And the last definite mental trait of dungeons and dragons is wisdom used for clerics or priests – but wisdom is the ability stil lto see rammifications of actions and make good decisions based on the information one concludes – it is one thing to use Intelligence to analyze a situation quickly and rapidly and reach the right understanding of the plaiyng field – it is another thing to have the wisdom to take the right actions – many spell casters have higher mental attributes in all mental categories than physical – admittedly a high dexterity is useful for spellcasters to be able to duck out of the way when objects get thrown at them - - that did happen at nights as a freshman and sophomore at CMU when random people threw things at me as I ran on the track of Gesling stadium.  - just a remembrance – they did it fro mtheir dorm windows I think and I could not tell who was doing it – it made me move somewhere else to run.  Rubbed left cheekbone with right index finger.   - but to finish off – Being rated high mentally as a character in dungeons and dragons involves not only a high intelligence – but also wisdom and charisma  and one last score score also comes into play – Constitution – the ability to endure physical pain – and it was implied in older version that Constitution also was about enduring mental pain – I am thinking that should be Charisma to balance things out and make more sense.  Just checked it is in the 4th edition.  And the point kiind of was to push it out a bit – Some people can be very good in their analytic capabilities and lack wisdom to draw the right conclusions or the Charisma to challenge the status quo.  As I said earlier – I normally played a Wizard in the old game and now i would switch to Sorcerer. 

That about covers the morning – 32 dick Cheney started working in DC.  Hmmmm- he went to Yale – I am a Yale reject even if it was my home state.

Allen Hunt 18:14 ESt


son to inauguration – leadership thing – I was in a leadership meetings at CCAC – best way to bring country together is to sue rick Warren – BUT  IT IS NOT BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER – EVANGELICALS LIKE IT – BUT THE GAY COMMUNITY DOESN'T AND IT IS HIGHLY ODD OBAMA DID NOT SPOT THAT WEDGING – IT IS SEPARATING THE COUTNRY ON AN ISSUE VERSUS UNITING IT – AN ODD THING FOR A EEOC PRESIDENT ELECT TO DO

catholic – not as christian I guess-  that was used in CMU – freshman – Gary would say catholics aren't Christians – to me – freeshman and sophomore year-  caller knows that somehow -

my god isn't exclusionary – but I don;t call him that- you miss that aprt – and I want the ceremony the way I beleive and with my worship practices and to exclude yours  -which is what you want-  why do you win? - that gets to be the issue – we use a way during the ceremony – so you pick one as favorite

name dropping duncan hunter – benediction does not mean warren is in Obama's camp -   Jesus and his disciples only went where wantred- doesn't relate in truth -

keyboard wire loose turning off power to    keyboard   - the lights on the left(right)  blinking off and on- on occassion – num lock – caps lock etc – odd that should happen -

Obama elected presidnet – actually not yet – Jan 9th – the electors come out – in addition if he is an illegal immigrant – if he has criminal acts – the election will not be the deciding thing and I thinki both of those statements are ture.  -  

fried chicken is not fundamental issues-  if we are one country we should get down to one set of fudnamental values-  there are some things that are left grey-  not certain thigns- we ahd a discussion about that in 1860 – and everyone doesn't get that -  and you should have an opinion on your country – this idea – it's not important – it is the country – those couple thoughts are what do and what should bind us – the rest is individual -  and this southern bullshit idea of disagreeing without beign disagreeable – that is southern – northerners – USED to argue like hell even strangers and you don't get shot – that is the north – I know from DAM when I did UNCT TV – fundraising – the souterners have this no talking thing – don't say something to upset- no instead you have a civil war-  that is what happens when you don't force out things that need to be said-  the south is wrong on that – argue with each other to acheive solidarity – the south is wrong on being pleasant when you actually disagree – it doesn't work – and makes a weaker country. 

finenbite

Jay- I think =- how are u – saying positive – for gays – but no problem with pastors at inauguration  - not necessarily intolerance -  it's overestimating the importance of this – it says a lot about application of constitution -  you don't seem to want me to write anymore allen – so I won't – this guy is clever – several things I could write – but same as others

Eric – if I were gay I'd be happy – missed that till allen says it – are u born atheist – wow  - you're not  born a christian

Rick O'warren

so it was gremlins in my tummy – ho ho

rubbed right ear as I get ready for allen -

hullabaloo

Bill Richardson is under investigation – but not Obama – that is pretty odd – and it sounds weird – meaning – is their an alterior motive. 
*

Mike – advice – people should pay attention to what matter in their lives and not butt in to other people's life-  worry about bread instead of free speech – and no Idon;t agree – you can;t walk over me and get me to worry about my stomach – cancer or being full.    I did miss the last point – 2 men getting married is not a basic block  of society – he slipped another one in – they are trying a new style to slip stuff under4 the radar that sounds more natural.    The other style was too easy to catch.,   - marriage is a legal contract though – he held his points until I started typing – we will catch them. 

look younger for $ 19.95 – doesn't anyonwe sell anything to make you look older allen – I am gboing for hte Ogra look form the dark crystal right now. 

Gay people can be for gay lifestyle-  caller  can speak out against it-  but do gay people get ssame rights – that is where the line is – do you recognize that?  - radical gays better watch – get straight community upset – so the radical gays better watch what they say – ah that pesky 1st ammendment is being burned and I am wlaking into a trap – just like the second phrase in this paragraph – all rights should be taken with good ethics – which gets rid of inappropriate outbursts – where there are some – the law handles them and not other people “deciding” soemthing should not go on – that idea is what is a problem – that you can decide what is inappropriate for your neighbor without going through recongized channels -  people don't think the legal thing applies jsut lena on your neighbor until they get the message and that is illegal – but it is done. 

Jake – Obama's choice- we elected him to be our leader not our puppet-  manchuria candidate -

Oprah can't get a ticket to the inauguration?????? - wow

couldn't find a person everyone would agree with – I bet you could – some english commentator-  not Brit – writer – Oprah would be a good choice for pastor for the nation – bill cosby -

Rick warren – brin civility – sounds li9ke Obama – is it at gunpoint we have civility -the ministry of peace in babylon 5?

at the inauguration – for preachers okay – giving inaugural portions – no

I am not a conservative or liberal – follower of christ – that is total BULLSHIT allen – you ahve poltiical opinions-  people of faith do by default IF they believe their faith – do not try that – I don;t care line- you could be a moderate on every issue-  but you're not on gay marriage – you have opinions – not poltical – is a lie-  everyone has opinions – most won;t be honest- it is costly and sometiems hard to be honest. 

- what if he chose jeremiah right -  happny new year – Democrats and republcians cut from same cloth – soem dems and Rs – not cut some – extreme right wing view ridiculous-  Rick warren isn't honest

Scott – missed name – baptist guy – just espouting – jealous pf Rcik warren – H jealous of preacher – I think preachers may be calling a spade a spade

– Obama frightens people because he is unknown - unknown frightens people – I have information – some things in Bush – things that people can never know about in this coutnry – caller is coutnry dropping – H curl your nose hair – I do have nose hair problems - - saying I will never be known

why can't people jsut get along – greed – or simply there are cookies to fight over and people still look at eating cookies instead of planting them and getting a cookie tree as a better deal. 

mistype Firefox can't find the server at www..allenhuntshow.com.- 18:47 EST 1/4/09 – passe gas as I reported this. 

another tin from the same company from mother when I mentioned them – my stomach is upset again – though no other affects yet. 

Kim -  prayer – is about Obama – not really about coutnry-  say what??? - get beyond your own agenda as a person – um so lie essentially – form of idoltry to have own opinion -  H – like princess of the pea – Victor Funderburk where are ya – yes she is antoher “funny” caller- caller-  she has gay friends last gay calel4r had Christian friends – odd all that -

itched privates as I emailed Ron Paul – 8:43 – and passed gas in last 2 minutes – didn't catch it

american who happens to be gay – not important the pastor- she is lying or not real – and she emphasized Bush thrown out – she is a palnt – not authentic at least.   18:42 Est – Janet

it is odd Obama could not have pciked someone more palatable to the gay community for the inaugural when you put it that way – I hand't thought about it. 

ahteists at 2% - that community is growing very quickly – then – 1.4% in 2001 non-denominational – atheists and everyone else. 

Freedom should be more important than bread in a better world – it is not a better world and bread is more important than freedom -

separate but equal wasn't that decided in board of education ? - that is the issue with legal marriage – marriage is being redefined legally not in a religious sense and the religions do not hold sway legally.  The legal definition of marriage should comply with other laws of the country and not discriminate. 

Obama – we're not going to agree on every single issue – disagree without being disagreeable – um during the Bush years – his detractors were not disagreeable while disagreeing – get the conservative talk show host reeducation center ready and I will be put on Risperdal -  you cannot really disagree without being disagreeable – you won;t be honest- midwesterners aren't – they made Barack Obama – and that is not a good thing – complete fiction -  the midwestern way – it's flaw are on display right now. 

should preachers be at a presidential ceremony – no – not really – should be a judge – not at the oath or  whatever – it is more Christian than not – reflective moment perhaps

Wesley sleep program – autistic son iwth medication – oh yes you are in the mark levin commercial traditon – I see – kfyo 18:19 Est

It is important for America to come together – Backy – that is the line that scares me – with him that means – you may disagree with me – I ma holding a gun to your head buddy – come together with me and work with me or else – that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president – no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen – that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer – um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person – should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue – it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be – and that is regrettable.

I guess I will say this it does apply to both groups that I saw – maybe a group and a person – I made the  comment on using a video to tell a story – music video to tell a story – there is some difference between what both of you are doing and what the groups I named are doing – there videos are “tighter” - the graphic story being told takes precedence over the performance – NOW IT IS COMMON WITH LOGICAL COHERENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE A PERFORMANCE COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE STORY LINE IN THE VIDEO AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE GOOD DO THAT – “they give you hell, hope it gives you hell”  – they perform when they are artists in the video – logical placement – it's sort of like product placement but you are placing yourself-  but it is done in character -  other groups like to have the performance throughout, but not in places where it fully lends itself to the story they are trying to tell on the video  – in a recent video and in this group's case – the themes in the videos are getting stronger – the story is stronger as the group gets older-  shall we say it's not the worst thing to have  that happen – but if I compare you on that idea – of STICKING TO THE SCRIPT – you have lines in your song – that don't directly reference graphically in the video – if you talk abou all this stuff in a mall – that feeling of all this stuff should carry on the video and in that place it gets abstracted and is a weak reference – if one of the singers is singing the part about a character at the mall – but she is performing and acting like a musical performer when that is not what she is singing about – that is logically inconsistent – that is another issue – IF you want to do this or want a video structured this way – when you jump it has to be logical – We didn;t start the fire has 4-5 different sets – jumps many times – and to a coffin – the jumps are very carefully thought out and I bet if I look referenced to song breaks – others like weird spacey shots in the middle of meaningful lines- and start off a theme of being a food court – and there is a mugging or theft – but it isn't perfectly clear what is going and then it jumps out of that scene – make the point and THEN jump out – and like if you built in – on the strong end theme of the song – sort of mall excess-  you build in vignettes in the mall excesses-  it can be corny and fun and zany it just has to aid the punchline which there is one at the end – but not all of what is shown up to that aids in building to that punchline -  like put the space stuff on the TV screen in the mall or maybe some fountain or display piece – the zany stuff could even be a cue at the end of each scene – it doesn't have to be disappear – just be placed and located better and look like you control the script versus pieces seem uncontrolled – that is the main difference – that and you jump in such a way that the story line can;t fully logically function and the ones I mention before do not do that.  And you can do wacky stuff like ride a bike through the mall – but what happens around the bike and and where the bike goes should relate to the song and what is being sung – it only loosely does that. 

– that is the idea-  you also put in pieces of you just singing when it's not chorus and they are substantive lines – description in the song – which disrupts continuity in getting into a story  If you want a tighter video – you may not – you like sort of zany theme where it doesn' fully come together

  - Someone else was trying to do that with a ship and a movie  – If that is your point – –– If you do want a video more to the story of the song versus an outtake of a performance - when you sing in the video it has to make sense in the story –you sing in a separate shot from the clips of the movie -  if you are sang to the lover on the side in certain places while the action is moving but the romantic male lead is doing something – like you are singing to him as he is in a picture frame moving through action and then the scene changes  - that would work and the singer is the narrator  your song sort of lends itself to you being a narrator and a moment maybe frozen or minimized again in a picture frame on screen while the words and the singer become prominent and then scene change and story is full – singer is hidden – it's that type of song and lends itself to that.  Versus the jar of one moment story and the next singer – they are two separate worlds – never mixed at all and it's a video – they should be intertwined.  Liked that movie and I liked the song above. 
For the song above before that – you could have security cams in the mall as the scene changer like end each mini-scene with like the eye of a security cam and go into it for the next scene – or use that for one scene – a Tv for another one – like that – where does the wackiness come from – and both of those could be somewhat logical places.  Like on pleasure seeker – at a cosmetics booth with free samples – at the food court getting free samples-  in a mirror trying on dresses or whatever else – using different things sold at the mall – one cool way – start with one and like put it in a video lense and like add one lense and then add 2 lense – each lense the same singer but seeking pleasure in a different way and at end of that section zoom into new lense and new part of the mall and start next scene.   - for singing the video – Tv screens music covers – even a digital picture frame or a computer laptop these days.  Or soemthing odder like the crystal ball of a fortune teller or maybe in one of the gumball machines.  - just soem thoughts cheers. 


there was an ad on hulu.co m for a website on education – not council ad2go.comm – that is not perfect – ti was like a gladitorial arena – but with people representing subjects and one even had equations on his body – pitting knowledge as sort of fighting for knowledge – but sort of a takeoff on the advice I gave on learning lessons from rock videos and applying it to education – of course this was not truly done with intent – just a commercial that seems to be a takeoff on something I said a day ago on hulu.com today 1/4/09 – that stuff happens so often I stop recording it – they had skeletons of a pair of gladiators at one point for like biology.  - but again not truly to educate – and an ad for a website – ho ho.  + - passed gas while writing this. 

accidentally put the email list #5 on boortz.com – forgot what was on clipboard – had dinner – ro brought up dinner to have – and that assisted my forgetfulness – rubbed back right side with right thumb and the did something else as I wrote this up.  16:27EST 1/4/09

part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time – the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news – the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh – which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't – I watch those – I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me – the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09 – did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity – true-  things we're still funny in elementary school – why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident – in that wondrous pattern – 2 of those in primary school – in addition the third who hung around mom – not the kid – the mother – less contact with them -  that was and now looks “funny” - and in high school – the car accident – and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school – there is  a funny pattern – not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong – BUT – it is there – both high school and primary school contain - “funny” incidents – where I now go – how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it – isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson – an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil – Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working – NEEDING FUEL – yet the price of gas if under half – there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas – the rascals are still trying to drive that up – givng the political environment of the US – it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now – and then as OPEC cuts production – buy tons of oil contracts – jack the hell out of the oil price again – ship in a polar bear or two to congress – whine global and preach alternative energy policy – the “evil” Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally – or rascally – investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen – the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND – the polar bear comes in – A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy – in Congress – I can see it now

Drilling in Utah – robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone – of course if you know geology – all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled – no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent – didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years – but land does not stay pristine – that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen – and that can take 10,000 years – so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda – rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that – we hear Robert Redford instead – hmmm.   Not much data on impact either – just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers – no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts – that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong – first weathering – it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone – but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava – it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT – in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly – cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change – os even if it is the same land – it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest – I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls – one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil – these deluded souls who support green technology and “forget” to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff – they had evidence for 10 years – so what I've got about 6 years left – I see.   Not surprised at this point. 





CBS – Shawano WI – hit men for entire town or 60 public officials – Canadian who mentions he has an Italian connection and thus the mofia – and one other things bothered me – they are trying to get better at taking away initial thoughts and mother is doing that more often – hired to kill politicians in a small town – mayor had to stop her open door policy – no – trying to find the other one -they are trying to get expert on taking one thing away from me when I am writing down and they-  did like I got the nudge to write this up write now and not watch other stories – they are testing how well they can make forget a response within in a minute – which was used in court before-  where I couldn;t remember a key point at trial – that I wanted to counter of the doctors.   They are practicing so they always get it right – they get in the ehtnic thing which is from recent and they got in one other thing that is from recent writing - - AH – I got it back – the journalist was the source of evil in the piece – he was a very evil person for what he said the two guys on the street- they were blocking that from me and I got it back – 15:12 EST – 1/4/09 – they are getting an AWFUL lot of practice on me – that is a bad thing and I guess it is nice not to be in court too – but they are trying to focus on making me forget every time – and here it looks like I remembered.   CBS is a communist organization – it is the representative of the group who may have hired the hitman saying that-  that some people think CBS is a communist organization – but it got in the piece – in addition – this was initially the only clip I could see – other than the full news – I talked about how for some reason the window was small – oddly – it is usually larger – so someone gamed it so I see this – I foudn the solution – before I saw this – but looked anyway.  - next – mother just came up after I finished this by 30 seconds – mentioned mice-  she has threatened that with the food here if – it stays in here – I will get a mouse – which happened in Pittsburgh twice.    We'll see. 

cbs seems to have forgotten the scroll bar on its video page – just a coincidence – not a coincidence – well – other associated videos have cropped up that have been helpful and me not seeing any but two of the available videos there unless I am does help prevent that from happening. 

See we scored another shot – cloning is evil – instead of introducing clones – you'll starve half of Africa and South America to death with your solution – I would take gladly “the madness” of cloning anyday – idiocracy.  - yu aren't – I know Japan said coopt the friendly videos – remember that segment like a month ago and they have tried to do it on youtube – and I did rub my face when I said cloning isn't a big deal and it isn't or at least it's not what some religious in the US make it out to be – I did get into a discussion about cloning with the recruiter in 2004 – in Oakland – a brief comment – and he was disapproving – but I defeated his argument – the religious hang up of the military and others with its draw backs – like I will remember to envision the mayan ruler cutting his penis to feed the sungod when I think of your hangups with me in the future – I do feel it comes VERY close to being that stupid.  - next – you left the point to the end though – on hulu.com – good strategy – for various reasons I was sort of prepared for it to go that way.  Clones of the future perhaps “replacing” in time the current ones who like different, but think and act the same way – cuase obviously looking the same but being your own person is far worse than looking different but being compelled and acting the same – I am pretty sure the latter would doom society faster.   The first scenario might actually get the idea to vary the DNA in their place of residence every once in a while – the second gorup won;t.  Scratching left and right sides of face with respective hands and top of head iwth left hand.    I do get that you are chilling and heating my room – or I did suspect that.   - Itching right knee with right fingers.    Last episode of buck rogers on hulu.com. 

and I do get that the objective is to get rid of the USA and upturn the world order which will give strength to the weaker countries – but shor term will cause reat instability and long term will retard the growth of man – someone is trying to later get other countries on top – to do that you have to kill the leader.  But in this caswe it is not just a power struggle – there is a plan behind it. 

11:09 EST mother came up here to tell me we have laundry chute ( where she has lost clothes for several critical weeks) – but it was jus as I was thinking something else – calling me to brag you have a child as a high school roommate and a job and that seemed to be the reason for calling.  - I was looking over what I have of palladium deciding whether or not the larger guides to it are worth putting my savungs on the line or not – the answer is coming back – no – it suffers from middle earth's problem – from I.C.E – Iron crown enterprises – a system that on paper looks good and very detailed and interesting, but in practice will function poorly – too hard to keep track of all the details – rubbed left nostril side with right thumb- palladium is a bad rules system – he wassn't trying to help me – he was trying to cut down on the time I spent doing something else during high school – calling up to bragf later in 2004.  He kept copies of my drawings – the start of the collection – he wasn't a friend – none of them were.   Mother tried to get me down there before – they wanted me down there so people could see me.   And I got fired there – first place in my life.  And he knew the rat fink who ran it – head of the foundation – and the visit from another while in 3rd year in CMU.  - So trust no one is agood motto.  He is an American American as well – several generations.  - Because he used Palladium – they were afraid of the computers.   How many more “smurfs” am I going to see?  Rat fink – very wealthy rat fink – relatively wealthy – local radio show host to CT called him that – that ties it in with another group- all roads lead to the crossroads – uggggghhhhh. - he iniated those games senior year and it was very odd.

seeing finally and it did take me a while – that perhaps the biggest issue that Pittsburgh had with me above all else is that it couldn't control me – that I did get myself into a lifestyle where something couldn't just and take away my freedom and that no one else could push on me and get me to do something I didn't want to do – and they want people in that mode – where they have a mortgage and like a career job and debts that mean they have to live like that OR if an artist that they are tied to a group and to clients that support them – a person who needs little income and has no great debts is not someone you can't control – my student loan is $200 at most and not that currently – if I wanted I could pay it off now – and they gathered that because I paid more than the monthly payment in Pittsburgh – so it's not even really what I said – what I did – etc etc that's the big problem – it is being free and not welded into the system in a way they can push on me.  Forehead resting on first two index fingers – it's blatant political control – many will feel – didn't you get that? – NO – Everything I read says that's not supposed to happen – the employee leaving the door open to the commercial store and the 4 year old got in and played with the toys in the store – Pittsburgh didn't lock the door – and they blame me.   But that anology also implies that any other place will have similar conditions – and I'm sorry that's not fully acceptable to me – in other every one of you is lying about the true circumstances and none of the laws are real, all the regions of the US exercise control like that and you'd do the same Pittsburgh did – where they were trying to push me into a career and a lifestyle I didn't want and so you don;t look at Pittsburgh and say you should never do that – to you it is just – they messed up and don't want to admit it.  So you wouldn't let me write free and clear either.  I don't know – and you're not talking – and even if you were I couldn't believe what you said anyway.   But law isn't really the law if what goes on goes on – it's a tool to use in certain cases, I am – like for control – I'll have to find out and I may not agree with decision and may reject it – but for blatant – just we are supposed to be able to force him to do whatever we want to – and if we can't – we're gonna kill him.  Rubbed bottom of nose with left index knuckle – there is an element of that in my case – not just – hating my ideas and this and that – they don't approve of letting young people wander about on their own – they want control of them and were under the dellusion that they had control of me.    And it's blatant poltical force and power and a community's very strong desire to rule itself with an iron fist – stronger than I ever imagined a human could have- like in ethics and morals-  to me being like that is very immoral – very destructive.   It also only works if you're quiet- because when a stand in for Rush Limbaugh tells me I'm going to the gym – I don;t get that that means mother is coming home with those heavy bags of salt and I will have to haul them – just like in Pittsburgh I missed their cues or only would understand them later.   Where you're saying something and you're not really saying something.   The US is going to have to decide what type of country it is going to be – I am not in a position to make the decision on that- but I will pass judgment as best I can from where I sit and if that carries weight so it does.   To raise me with one set of values my whole life and be lying to me the whole time – well good day.    The Corps the Corps is father and kill anyone who gets in its way – ho ho ho ho ho ho ho – I almost sound like Santa Claus. 

kfyo 8:50 EST 1/4/09 – even this show is interesting – caller with God on a real estate deal – it wasn't through clever economic manuevering – it was the grace of God – we want people deranged and thinking the world runs on strawberry shrotcake so they are easier to manipulate.  Whooppee. 

mistype – redi.senate.gov – I caught it – hit the stop button – 1/4/09 8:26 EST

2 paste errors on rove.com 3rd try successful 8:22 EST 1/4/09 - touched toes of left and right feet together aqs I decided to email this and write it up - right ear itching.   suddnely closed lips. 

was going to email boortz from a different windows-  I have his opened – but decided to do it by typing his name and opening another one – I accidentally opened the first one when trying to go to the document to make sure I was emailing him the right thing and I hit the wrong tab and almsot used it before realizing the mistake.   It's like having a doesn(dozen) microphones attached to you. 

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time – right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly – then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched – 8:13 Est – just can't stop it. Ho ho ho – right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that – and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days – figure out how to do this to people – wow. 

with senator reid a second time – had the wrong thing in the clipbaord – pasted wrong thing first – 8:09 EST 1/4/09.   - pinky on right hand bumped into empty yogurt cup next to it as I decided to go to another senator instead. 

there was a slight touching of my middle and inddex fingers in my left hand -followed by me curling my toes as I decided to write it up as I went back to and emailed mccain.senate.gov 8:07 ESt 1/4/09

and forgot with reid.senate.gov – did not have message ready that I wanted – just the single line forgot to compesate – wrong thing on clipboard when pasting – 7:51 Est 1/4/09 – so I decided to wait and mail him later.  and success - paste error on mccain.senate.gov -2nd time successful - so I won't email either - wait on him 7:53 EST.  Success because it made them do another error - bruth left hand under right under upperarm- by armpit  also as I wrote this up.  - and first try on rove.com but my left thumb still hit my stomach ever so slightly and ti doesn't normally do that.  and the typoing got slow for a moment.  7:58 ESt do it in Rove's window.  Coughing as I switch to the clintonfoundation.  Licked upper lip as I decided to go on t newt.org.   Touched right thumb to right index finger as I pulled up nightlybusiness.org instead. Normally it doesn't happen and I am having issues iwth my lips – touching them.  Touchign index and thumb again on right hand as I went to move off nightly business.

the truth potentially – IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show – and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie – maybe not started by him – but he believed that too – that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care – ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY – THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS – IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT – THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO – IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn – they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know – much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds – 20 -30 east flying heading north – I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities – most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example – to make money he or they could just do another movie – or write a book – a charity is not – there is work and cost – like to take people's compalints and research them – even if the idea is to block the complaint – someone has to take and research it – and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it – licking upper lip and now coughing – one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be – that charities are easy money – a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY – THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL – YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months – or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior – there are potential others – a form of of population control – etc etc – in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity – OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class – to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society – really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money – cancer research instead of education funding – making education super expensive – conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end – you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead – I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization – like I can't believe it – it would so not demoncracy – I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces – we can pass any law we want to – I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment – coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going – the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus – the other stimuli did not stimulate well – the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others – then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade – this would include IL too – it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible – transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces – it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional – someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster – any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces – which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns – Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama – that does happen – but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing – with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

--
A Middle Eastern Alamo?
I am not a good judge with Israel – I gave my theory – I do stick by it – the people of Gaza will remember this for a long time – and will feel – or I would feel less remorse at striking at Israel if I were one of them after an incident like this – isn't that a problem?   Have your really worked fully on methods to abduct or capture the people you deem responsible for the bombing without harming the rest of the population? - These pictures invite world outrage – Israel must know that – like almsot yhou are baiting the world to react – in honesty – like the Us(US) and colombia – when (you) do raids – don't you try to hit hard and fast minimize troop exposure to danger – get the targets quickly versus dragging out a campaign – I do not udnerstand any longer and have to again raise a flag-   What are you doing – besides levelling a city it looks like.  (unless this is the only way). 


from yahoo news
the mastermind of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, exhorted Palestinians to "crush" Israeli forces and to target Israeli civilians – that an interesting line -

and their rocket attacks concur with that – so the problem is that the leaders are hidden and the civillians are protecting them – would any of the civillians leave with the Israelis- into refugee camps while other business was going on in the city?   To clear the civillians not involved out of the way – or is that too hard to discern – I guess long term – if you are doing this it does make sense to be thorough -  i hope that it achieves the best outcome – again I think that if you did that to me – if you bombed me and forcibly took away the people i elected – maybe the election was done through terror – but that would encourage resentment that would not go away.   Do you have a second part after clearing out the people who may well just want to kill Israelis ?   Scratching back of head with right hand – you did say a permanent change in the situation.

60 Minutes – the wire for my keyboard is loose – I should have a still working spare and this one still works – yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer – it is “odd” how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV – itching – left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth – I was feeling aversion to writing this up – it is going now – maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney – said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time – my old license pla from Chicago – someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there – worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer – neat trick – the lights do blink – num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like – happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate – NY Prosecutor “deterring” drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder – this is a highly troubling story – and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems – the rammifications are not so simple – I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver – but as I cough up a little phlegm – here's the thing on this – I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude – bury him under the court – very vengeful – and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that – Someone is cackling somewhere – because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone – and that is the point – BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be – we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one – you can't win – be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink – he or she wasn'tr thinking – they lost control of the vehicle – and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case – a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident – the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown – it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent – to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case – you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women – but men may drink more – be expected to drink in more situations – I don;t know the stats – but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink – I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving – But the issues is – drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to – unless . . . .. intent can be determined – which in honesty even right now I bet it can – but not in a way that is admissable in court – but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing – the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink – it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk – that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along – he always made a big deal about that – I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish – when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me – it bristled me quite a bit – today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt – but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while – it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in – it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me – my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years – but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner – and I wouldn't have ordered there without him “meniktoning” it to me – and I didn't like – food was fine – it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk – I know with drugs – a professor bascially endorsed it by being there – and also smoking – it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving – second one – with brownies – funny brownies – I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor – we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it – again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases – with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs – and that is the big problem – oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs – and they probably could if they wanted to somehow – but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading – it has been done for quite a well – but we are talking about CMU – and trusting the wizards of CMU – DON'T – at least not at first – while brain patterns may be critical – I see a flaw in the study – but the premise can brain patterns be read – from my experience it certainly appears so – so the premise is not fully flawed – there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues – do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful – to me – I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003 – there was a MRI of my brain – well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005 – like in 2002 or 2003 – there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff – but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test – the computer images didn't come up – and the person – female – dark hair – did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial – the data was wasted – because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons – like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B – C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study – because my data was thrown out – yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that – MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes – though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking – school pyschologist at CCAC – in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution – we were talkign about medication – he used the phrase won't you try a little bit – and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me – on Dec 23 2005 – used the same phrase – won;t you try a little bit – when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no – in the emergency room – I did not say not – and I said maybe and maybe even yes – because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them – that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor – that female – reminded me of Jessica Lynch – from DAM – odd thing there.  Just a coincidence. 

But now maybe that I have shown how CMU helped me – perhaps I should help CMU – I am scared of these guys – Do they encourage the thought of window from the same picture-  because they said they generically know the brain pattern of window thought – what parts of the brain a person will use for window for any person – yet they haven't tried every stimulus or even a corpus of stimuli to indcue the thought of window – touching a window in a natural setting  may send a very different brain signal than the black and white image of window used – do different pictures of window have the same brain location – the word window – hearing it – hearing the sound of a double hung window being shut – they ahve those in Pittsburgh – mother got awning windows in this house oddly which the hurricane shutters on the top floor block from opening because of the low ceilings – 8 foot versus the builder wanted 9 foot – that does not seem to be accidental.  - but the good people at CMU – should not say they know a generic pattern of thought – their data is too preliminary – with just using the same picture.    Their time horizon is very optimistic for a machine that can fully read someone's mind – I can be wrong – but no one who is deceiving the machine – not a test where subject  can think about any object from any reference they have at least as a grounding should be there – the technology will not be 100% accurate from what they have shown – or that iws not proven and I worry about using that as court evidence for a while – I think it might be like cancer drugs.   We'll see a few of them come and go.    CMU is getting more corrupt – or corrupted by powerful money – it was while  I was there – odd to have CMU and Texas Tech together in 60 minutes.  - Rubbing back neck after touch by both eyes – index knuckle bottom to right cheekbone top and index finger to left, left eye edge and palm on neck all with right hand 

Texas Tech Football – fairy tale brings NFL money and influence – I don't want to talk about the Texas Tech football team – I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons - - oh my keyboard just blinked – ho oho – but I guess we are switching things a bit – Okay with that done let's talk D &D – The Zhentarim are presented i nthe way Dugneons and Dragons presents evil where for the most part the villain just wants to eventually get you onto a torture wrack and take al lyour magical items – but the Zhentarim in the Forgotten Realms setting do build a network of spies in smaller towns like Shadodale – home of Elminster the Seer – the most pwoerful I think mage in Faerun as Forgotten Realms is called-  Elminster moves to Faerun(Shadowdale) after many adventures he isn't born there – it isn't the size of Saerloon i nthe summer which if I remeber reaches over 200,000 but defintiely not quite 300,000 just yet – Saerloon is something like that in its prime seasons.  But we are talking about shadowdale and the zhentarim like having a network of spies but being in dungeons and dragons they're evil and pose as shady merchants, only occassionally do you see villain in D &D get real villain smarts and like totally infiltrate a good com munity posing as something they're not – polymorph others spells and many to later one's appearance do exist And definitely in Zhentil keep in one time period 2 Devils pose as a ruling couple of humans and no one knows their disguise within Zhentil Kepp for a long time.   - Coughing as I write that-  nearly lopped off my right big toe toenail with my left heel  pushing up on nail as I crossed my feet.   Gelatine from gummy bears does get your toenails to grow doesn't it Haven't had to clip them in months.  What did mother give me oh -  and she bought precisely two boxes of gelatine – jello – that is the other reason forsmall amounts of food – she controls dosages of nturients like medicine – rubbing left side of face with left hand as I write that and hir cheeck with palm and top of head left side in hair with fingers.  Wasn't an even rub.   Oh this is such a good horror movie.   Dropped this keyboard a little – common theme that – gget distracted for a minute – thinking about buying used versus buying new stuff at amazon and high school and looking up one of the people from elementary school yesterday online like I did antoher classmate – get into loop of thought – get out of it and rub left corner of motuh with left thubm – pass gas as I write that up  -touched thumbs as I identified ti as a loop of thought – but Zhentil keep is not like Sauron in the second age – where he comes as the bearer of gifts and good tidings and comes into the isle of Numenor as a fair person and only slowly corrupts them – this is before the war of the ring series by a thousand years or so – Second age – war of the ring ends the third age.  Mother is up 6:31 EST can hear her moving downstairs.  Biting into hand another pimple or small scab on hand – whitehead on my right thigh last night – they had mostly healed for a while – back to story -  there aren't many athletic contests within Dungeons and Dragons – jousting is mentioned in the C – it'sbeing blocked – before Imortals and Master  -but after Basic and Expert – I want to say Companion – that's not it – it is Companion – in the Companion series  they do talk of jousting and hosting a jjousting tournament as a noble lord – and rules on that.  Rubbed all around head as I began to suspcet that ti was companion - - nwo a yawn – they do nto want me to write this one – it is funny to watch this – and not so funny – but In Dungeons and Dragons at least in the rule book one doesn't getting into how to maximize revenue from a joust very much – of course in the model given – the lord or owner pays for the peasants to come to the joust and ti is  means to keep them happy – no lord invented the idea of makiing the peasants pay for their own holiday.  And yes agian no one thought of how to maximize revenue or attendance and interest in a jousting tourfnament in Dungoens and Dragons – it just isn't that important to other goals of the companion set such as the eventually goal of some charctgers to battle with the monsters in the world or other issues – jousting is far down the list much of the time.  We probably don't get into the idea of fairytale jousting tournaments and their imapct on peasant interest in jousting because of course dungeons and dragons si a fairy tale and the idea of the little prince being crowned king is quite easy to produce in dungeons and dragons and doesn't have to be faked and managed to happen – it happens all the time – in fact is boring and we moved on to crowinging the dark elf rebel as a noble above ground.  
That was one thing I wanted to get into – antoher – ya know when looking over Palladium and Rolemaster or middle earth both of which use the same gaming system – from Iron Crown Enterprises – one would wonder why the company is named after the Iron Crown of Morgoth – details details – but all three of those games have like 8 to ten attributes to describe a cahracters basic abilities unlike dungeons and dragons which has 6 – and therein actually USED to lie its beauty – it relatively simple game mechanics and then too many physicist and experts on hand to hand combat got together and now  apaprently in the 3rd edition there was a rules compendium put togehter just for the different – AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH – and it won appeal originally on its simplicity even if its depictions of combat weren't perfectly realistic – your fighter can take more damage than four warhorses – really ?  - but I digress – attributes I was focusing on attributes six attributes of dungeons and dragons – in particular things have shifted over the years – but I didn't want to get into the full history – instead – in Dungeons and Dragons when evaluating a person's mental abilities – the psionicist for example – intelligence over the ability to analyze data quickly is not just one stat – or being intelligent is not just one stat – it is actually 2 if not 3 stats – maybe even 4.   There is of course Intelligences which would be the stat that would be used in analyzing and calculating so many calcualtions per second or seeing a pattern and the raw recognition of a pattern or the many movements and getting to a pattern that would be under the attribute of intelligence – what used to be and still the traditional needed stat to be a wizard – of course in the third they introduced sorcerers who cast wizard spells but usede Charisma as the prime stat for their power and not intelligence or raw number crunching.  Charisma has changed over the years as it is hard to define – my definition currently may not fully match the games either – it used to sort of be good looks – it is definitely at first the characteristic a football coach would possess that drive and passion that can be used to sway the audience – but in current editions it has changed – and in 3rd edition I think – Charisma became more like Wisdom used to be and the drive the force of will – that became part of charisma's protfolio as an attribute – which is not there in the 1st edition – but it is there now and having a high Charisma is necessary to being a sorcerer.  Many sorcerers in the game tend to be loners it is noted here.  And the last definite mental trait of dungeons and dragons is wisdom used for clerics or priests – but wisdom is the ability stil lto see rammifications of actions and make good decisions based on the information one concludes – it is one thing to use Intelligence to analyze a situation quickly and rapidly and reach the right understanding of the plaiyng field – it is another thing to have the wisdom to take the right actions – many spell casters have higher mental attributes in all mental categories than physical – admittedly a high dexterity is useful for spellcasters to be able to duck out of the way when objects get thrown at them - - that did happen at nights as a freshman and sophomore at CMU when random people threw things at me as I ran on the track of Gesling stadium.  - just a remembrance – they did it fro mtheir dorm windows I think and I could not tell who was doing it – it made me move somewhere else to run.  Rubbed left cheekbone with right index finger.   - but to finish off – Being rated high mentally as a character in dungeons and dragons involves not only a high intelligence – but also wisdom and charisma  and one last score score also comes into play – Constitution – the ability to endure physical pain – and it was implied in older version that Constitution also was about enduring mental pain – I am thinking that should be Charisma to balance things out and make more sense.  Just checked it is in the 4th edition.  And the point kiind of was to push it out a bit – Some people can be very good in their analytic capabilities and lack wisdom to draw the right conclusions or the Charisma to challenge the status quo.  As I said earlier – I normally played a Wizard in the old game and now i would switch to Sorcerer. 

That about covers the morning – 32 dick Cheney started working in DC.  Hmmmm- he went to Yale – I am a Yale reject even if it was my home state.

gas is up tonight due to whatever was in that tin – or just mother working on my innards – but so far it is just gas and not worse tahn that.  So covering the body with something unexpected helps – hmmm.

allen hunt- disagree without being disagreeable – translates to – I have my opinion and you have yours – you may be right – but I don't want to hear it – and if you don;t leave me alone – there will be hell to pay – But only one opinion is right or there is only one correct direction or best direction -  AND WE DO HAVE TO HCOSE THAT OR DIE OUT AS A SOCIETY  - it is that simple – and you don;t want a choice if you lose- hmmm.

Allen Hunt 18:14 ESt


son to inauguration – leadership thing – I was in a leadership meetings at CCAC – best way to bring country together is to sue rick Warren – BUT  IT IS NOT BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER – EVANGELICALS LIKE IT – BUT THE GAY COMMUNITY DOESN'T AND IT IS HIGHLY ODD OBAMA DID NOT SPOT THAT WEDGING – IT IS SEPARATING THE COUTNRY ON AN ISSUE VERSUS UNITING IT – AN ODD THING FOR A EEOC PRESIDENT ELECT TO DO

catholic – not as christian I guess-  that was used in CMU – freshman – Gary would say catholics aren't Christians – to me – freeshman and sophomore year-  caller knows that somehow -

my god isn't exclusionary – but I don;t call him that- you miss that aprt – and I want the ceremony the way I beleive and with my worship practices and to exclude yours  -which is what you want-  why do you win? - that gets to be the issue – we use a way during the ceremony – so you pick one as favorite

name dropping duncan hunter – benediction does not mean warren is in Obama's camp -   Jesus and his disciples only went where wantred- doesn't relate in truth -

keyboard wire loose turning off power to    keyboard   - the lights on the left(right)  blinking off and on- on occassion – num lock – caps lock etc – odd that should happen -

Obama elected presidnet – actually not yet – Jan 9th – the electors come out – in addition if he is an illegal immigrant – if he has criminal acts – the election will not be the deciding thing and I thinki both of those statements are ture.  -  

fried chicken is not fundamental issues-  if we are one country we should get down to one set of fudnamental values-  there are some things that are left grey-  not certain thigns- we ahd a discussion about that in 1860 – and everyone doesn't get that -  and you should have an opinion on your country – this idea – it's not important – it is the country – those couple thoughts are what do and what should bind us – the rest is individual -  and this southern bullshit idea of disagreeing without beign disagreeable – that is southern – northerners – USED to argue like hell even strangers and you don't get shot – that is the north – I know from DAM when I did UNCT TV – fundraising – the souterners have this no talking thing – don't say something to upset- no instead you have a civil war-  that is what happens when you don't force out things that need to be said-  the south is wrong on that – argue with each other to acheive solidarity – the south is wrong on being pleasant when you actually disagree – it doesn't work – and makes a weaker country. 

finenbite

Jay- I think =- how are u – saying positive – for gays – but no problem with pastors at inauguration  - not necessarily intolerance -  it's overestimating the importance of this – it says a lot about application of constitution -  you don't seem to want me to write anymore allen – so I won't – this guy is clever – several things I could write – but same as others

Eric – if I were gay I'd be happy – missed that till allen says it – are u born atheist – wow  - you're not  born a christian

Rick O'warren

so it was gremlins in my tummy – ho ho

rubbed right ear as I get ready for allen -

Bill Richardson is under investigation – but not Obama – that is pretty odd – and it sounds weird – meaning – is their an alterior motive.

Mike – advice – people should pay attention to what matter in their lives and not butt in to other people's life-  worry about bread instead of free speech – and no Idon;t agree – you can;t walk over me and get me to worry about my stomach – cancer or being full.    I did miss the last point – 2 men getting married is not a basic block  of society – he slipped another one in – they are trying a new style to slip stuff under4 the radar that sounds more natural.    The other style was too easy to catch.,   - marriage is a legal contract though – he held his points until I started typing – we will catch them. 

look younger for $ 19.95 – doesn't anyonwe sell anything to make you look older allen – I am gboing for hte Ogra look form the dark crystal right now. 

Gay people can be for gay lifestyle-  caller  can speak out against it-  but do gay people get ssame rights – that is where the line is – do you recognize that?  - radical gays better watch – get straight community upset – so the radical gays better watch what they say – ah that pesky 1st ammendment is being burned and I am wlaking into a trap – just like the second phrase in this paragraph – all rights should be taken with good ethics – which gets rid of inappropriate outbursts – where there are some – the law handles them and not other people “deciding” soemthing should not go on – that idea is what is a problem – that you can decide what is inappropriate for your neighbor without going through recongized channels -  people don't think the legal thing applies jsut lena on your neighbor until they get the message and that is illegal – but it is done. 

Jake – Obama's choice- we elected him to be our leader not our puppet-  manchuria candidate -

Oprah can't get a ticket to the inauguration?????? - wow

couldn't find a person everyone would agree with – I bet you could – some english commentator-  not Brit – writer – Oprah would be a good choice for pastor for the nation – bill cosby -

Rick warren – brin civility – sounds li9ke Obama – is it at gunpoint we have civility -the ministry of peace in babylon 5?

at the inauguration – for preachers okay – giving inaugural portions – no

I am not a conservative or liberal – follower of christ – that is total BULLSHIT allen – you ahve poltiical opinions-  people of faith do by default IF they believe their faith – do not try that – I don;t care line- you could be a moderate on every issue-  but you're not on gay marriage – you have opinions – not poltical – is a lie-  everyone has opinions – most won;t be honest- it is costly and sometiems hard to be honest. 

- what if he chose jeremiah right -  happny new year – Democrats and republcians cut from same cloth – soem dems and Rs – not cut some – extreme right wing view ridiculous-  Rick warren isn't honest

Scott – missed name – baptist guy – just espouting – jealous pf Rcik warren – H jealous of preacher – I think preachers may be calling a spade a spade

– Obama frightens people because he is unknown - unknown frightens people – I have information – some things in Bush – things that people can never know about in this coutnry – caller is coutnry dropping – H curl your nose hair – I do have nose hair problems - - saying I will never be known

why can't people jsut get along – greed – or simply there are cookies to fight over and people still look at eating cookies instead of planting them and getting a cookie tree as a better deal.

another tin from the same company from mother when I mentioned them – my stomach is upset again – though no other affects yet. 

Kim -  prayer – is about Obama – not really about coutnry-  say what??? - get beyond your own agenda as a person – um so lie essentially – form of idoltry to have own opinion -  H – like princess of the pea – Victor Funderburk where are ya – yes she is antoher “funny” caller- caller-  she has gay friends last gay calel4r had Christian friends – odd all that -

american who happens to be gay – not important the pastor- she is lying or not real – and she emphasized Bush thrown out – she is a palnt – not authentic at least.   18:42 Est – Janet

it is odd Obama could not have pciked someone more palatable to the gay community for the inaugural when you put it that way – I hand't thought about it. 

ahteists at 2% - that community is growing very quickly – then – 1.4% in 2001 non-denominational – atheists and everyone else. 

Freedom should be more important than bread in a better world – it is not a better world and bread is more important than freedom -

separate but equal wasn't that decided in board of education ? - that is the issue with legal marriage – marriage is being redefined legally not in a religious sense and the religions do not hold sway legally.  The legal definition of marriage should comply with other laws of the country and not discriminate. 

Obama – we're not going to agree on every single issue – disagree without being disagreeable – um during the Bush years – his detractors were not disagreeable while disagreeing – get the conservative talk show host reeducation center ready and I will be put on Risperdal -  you cannot really disagree without being disagreeable – you won;t be honest- midwesterners aren't – they made Barack Obama – and that is not a good thing – complete fiction -  the midwestern way – it's flaw are on display right now. 

should preachers be at a presidential ceremony – no – not really – should be a judge – not at the oath or  whatever – it is more Christian than not – reflective moment perhaps

Wesley sleep program – autistic son iwth medication – oh yes you are in the mark levin commercial traditon – I see – kfyo 18:19 Est

It is important for America to come together – Backy – that is the line that scares me – with him that means – you may disagree with me – I ma holding a gun to your head buddy – come together with me and work with me or else – that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president – no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen – that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer – um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person – should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue – it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be – and that is regrettable. 

I forgot Rex -

and a little spider came down from the ceiling as I wrote the section below – spinning a line down between me and my computer – very small spider.   - the psider on my screen twice with Senator Warner – a year ago or more now. 

from movie critic to music video critic -
I guess I will say this it does apply to both groups that I saw – maybe a group and a person – I made the  comment on using a video to tell a story – music video to tell a story – there is some difference between what both of you are doing and what the groups I named are doing – there videos are “tighter” - the graphic story being told takes precedence over the performance – NOW IT IS COMMON WITH LOGICAL COHERENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE A PERFORMANCE COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE STORY LINE IN THE VIDEO AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE GOOD DO THAT – “they give you hell, hope it gives you hell”  – they perform when they are artists in the video – logical placement – it's sort of like product placement but you are placing yourself-  but it is done in character -  other groups like to have the performance throughout, but not in places where it fully lends itself to the story they are trying to tell on the video  – in a recent video and in this group's case – the themes in the videos are getting stronger – the story is stronger as the group gets older-  shall we say it's not the worst thing to have  that happen – but if I compare you on that idea – of STICKING TO THE SCRIPT – you have lines in your song – that don't directly reference graphically in the video – if you talk abou all this stuff in a mall – that feeling of all this stuff should carry on the video and in that place it gets abstracted and is a weak reference – if one of the singers is singing the part about a character at the mall – but she is performing and acting like a musical performer when that is not what she is singing about – that is logically inconsistent – that is another issue – IF you want to do this or want a video structured this way – when you jump it has to be logical – We didn;t start the fire has 4-5 different sets – jumps many times – and to a coffin – the jumps are very carefully thought out and I bet if I look referenced to song breaks – others like weird spacey shots in the middle of meaningful lines- and start off a theme of being a food court – and there is a mugging or theft – but it isn't perfectly clear what is going and then it jumps out of that scene – make the point and THEN jump out – and like if you built in – on the strong end theme of the song – sort of mall excess-  you build in vignettes in the mall excesses-  it can be corny and fun and zany it just has to aid the punchline which there is one at the end – but not all of what is shown up to that aids in building to that punchline -  like put the space stuff on the TV screen in the mall or maybe some fountain or display piece – the zany stuff could even be a cue at the end of each scene – it doesn't have to be disappear – just be placed and located better and look like you control the script versus pieces seem uncontrolled – that is the main difference – that and you jump in such a way that the story line can;t fully logically function and the ones I mention before do not do that.  And you can do wacky stuff like ride a bike through the mall – but what happens around the bike and and where the bike goes should relate to the song and what is being sung – it only loosely does that. 

– that is the idea-  you also put in pieces of you just singing when it's not chorus and they are substantive lines – description in the song – which disrupts continuity in getting into a story  If you want a tighter video – you may not – you like sort of zany theme where it doesn' fully come together

  - Someone else was trying to do that with a ship and a movie  – If that is your point – –– If you do want a video more to the story of the song versus an outtake of a performance - when you sing in the video it has to make sense in the story –you sing in a separate shot from the clips of the movie -  if you are sang to the lover on the side in certain places while the action is moving but the romantic male lead is doing something – like you are singing to him as he is in a picture frame moving through action and then the scene changes  - that would work and the singer is the narrator  your song sort of lends itself to you being a narrator and a moment maybe frozen or minimized again in a picture frame on screen while the words and the singer become prominent and then scene change and story is full – singer is hidden – it's that type of song and lends itself to that.  Versus the jar of one moment story and the next singer – they are two separate worlds – never mixed at all and it's a video – they should be intertwined.  Liked that movie and I liked the song above. 
For the song above before that – you could have security cams in the mall as the scene changer like end each mini-scene with like the eye of a security cam and go into it for the next scene – or use that for one scene – a Tv for another one – like that – where does the wackiness come from – and both of those could be somewhat logical places.  Like on pleasure seeker – at a cosmetics booth with free samples – at the food court getting free samples-  in a mirror trying on dresses or whatever else – using different things sold at the mall – one cool way – start with one and like put it in a video lense and like add one lense and then add 2 lense – each lense the same singer but seeking pleasure in a different way and at end of that section zoom into new lense and new part of the mall and start next scene.   - for singing the video – Tv screens music covers – even a digital picture frame or a computer laptop these days.  Or soemthing odder like the crystal ball of a fortune teller or maybe in one of the gumball machines.  - just soem thoughts cheers. 


there was an ad on hulu.co m for a website on education – not council ad2go.comm – that is not perfect – ti was like a gladitorial arena – but with people representing subjects and one even had equations on his body – pitting knowledge as sort of fighting for knowledge – but sort of a takeoff on the advice I gave on learning lessons from rock videos and applying it to education – of course this was not truly done with intent – just a commercial that seems to be a takeoff on something I said a day ago on hulu.com today 1/4/09 – that stuff happens so often I stop recording it – they had skeletons of a pair of gladiators at one point for like biology.  - but again not truly to educate – and an ad for a website – ho ho.  + - passed gas while writing this. 

accidentally put the email list #5 on boortz.com – forgot what was on clipboard – had dinner – ro brought up dinner to have – and that assisted my forgetfulness – rubbed back right side with right thumb and the did something else as I wrote this up.  16:27EST 1/4/09

part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time – the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news – the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh – which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't – I watch those – I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me – the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09 – did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity – true-  things we're still funny in elementary school – why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident – in that wondrous pattern – 2 of those in primary school – in addition the third who hung around mom – not the kid – the mother – less contact with them -  that was and now looks “funny” - and in high school – the car accident – and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school – there is  a funny pattern – not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong – BUT – it is there – both high school and primary school contain - “funny” incidents – where I now go – how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it – isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson – an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil – Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working – NEEDING FUEL – yet the price of gas if under half – there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas – the rascals are still trying to drive that up – givng the political environment of the US – it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now – and then as OPEC cuts production – buy tons of oil contracts – jack the hell out of the oil price again – ship in a polar bear or two to congress – whine global and preach alternative energy policy – the “evil” Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally – or rascally – investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen – the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND – the polar bear comes in – A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy – in Congress – I can see it now

Drilling in Utah – robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone – of course if you know geology – all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled – no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent – didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years – but land does not stay pristine – that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen – and that can take 10,000 years – so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda – rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that – we hear Robert Redford instead – hmmm.   Not much data on impact either – just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers – no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts – that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong – first weathering – it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone – but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava – it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT – in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly – cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change – os even if it is the same land – it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest – I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls – one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil – these deluded souls who support green technology and “forget” to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff – they had evidence for 10 years – so what I've got about 6 years left – I see.   Not surprised at this point. 





CBS – Shawano WI – hit men for entire town or 60 public officials – Canadian who mentions he has an Italian connection and thus the mofia – and one other things bothered me – they are trying to get better at taking away initial thoughts and mother is doing that more often – hired to kill politicians in a small town – mayor had to stop her open door policy – no – trying to find the other one -they are trying to get expert on taking one thing away from me when I am writing down and they-  did like I got the nudge to write this up write now and not watch other stories – they are testing how well they can make forget a response within in a minute – which was used in court before-  where I couldn;t remember a key point at trial – that I wanted to counter of the doctors.   They are practicing so they always get it right – they get in the ehtnic thing which is from recent and they got in one other thing that is from recent writing - - AH – I got it back – the journalist was the source of evil in the piece – he was a very evil person for what he said the two guys on the street- they were blocking that from me and I got it back – 15:12 EST – 1/4/09 – they are getting an AWFUL lot of practice on me – that is a bad thing and I guess it is nice not to be in court too – but they are trying to focus on making me forget every time – and here it looks like I remembered.   CBS is a communist organization – it is the representative of the group who may have hired the hitman saying that-  that some people think CBS is a communist organization – but it got in the piece – in addition – this was initially the only clip I could see – other than the full news – I talked about how for some reason the window was small – oddly – it is usually larger – so someone gamed it so I see this – I foudn the solution – before I saw this – but looked anyway.  - next – mother just came up after I finished this by 30 seconds – mentioned mice-  she has threatened that with the food here if – it stays in here – I will get a mouse – which happened in Pittsburgh twice.    We'll see. 

cbs seems to have forgotten the scroll bar on its video page – just a coincidence – not a coincidence – well – other associated videos have cropped up that have been helpful and me not seeing any but two of the available videos there unless I am does help prevent that from happening. 

See we scored another shot – cloning is evil – instead of introducing clones – you'll starve half of Africa and South America to death with your solution – I would take gladly “the madness” of cloning anyday – idiocracy.  - yu aren't – I know Japan said coopt the friendly videos – remember that segment like a month ago and they have tried to do it on youtube – and I did rub my face when I said cloning isn't a big deal and it isn't or at least it's not what some religious in the US make it out to be – I did get into a discussion about cloning with the recruiter in 2004 – in Oakland – a brief comment – and he was disapproving – but I defeated his argument – the religious hang up of the military and others with its draw backs – like I will remember to envision the mayan ruler cutting his penis to feed the sungod when I think of your hangups with me in the future – I do feel it comes VERY close to being that stupid.  - next – you left the point to the end though – on hulu.com – good strategy – for various reasons I was sort of prepared for it to go that way.  Clones of the future perhaps “replacing” in time the current ones who like different, but think and act the same way – cuase obviously looking the same but being your own person is far worse than looking different but being compelled and acting the same – I am pretty sure the latter would doom society faster.   The first scenario might actually get the idea to vary the DNA in their place of residence every once in a while – the second gorup won;t.  Scratching left and right sides of face with respective hands and top of head iwth left hand.    I do get that you are chilling and heating my room – or I did suspect that.   - Itching right knee with right fingers.    Last episode of buck rogers on hulu.com. 

and I do get that the objective is to get rid of the USA and upturn the world order which will give strength to the weaker countries – but shor term will cause reat instability and long term will retard the growth of man – someone is trying to later get other countries on top – to do that you have to kill the leader.  But in this caswe it is not just a power struggle – there is a plan behind it. 

11:09 EST mother came up here to tell me we have laundry chute ( where she has lost clothes for several critical weeks) – but it was jus as I was thinking something else – calling me to brag you have a child as a high school roommate and a job and that seemed to be the reason for calling.  - I was looking over what I have of palladium deciding whether or not the larger guides to it are worth putting my savungs on the line or not – the answer is coming back – no – it suffers from middle earth's problem – from I.C.E – Iron crown enterprises – a system that on paper looks good and very detailed and interesting, but in practice will function poorly – too hard to keep track of all the details – rubbed left nostril side with right thumb- palladium is a bad rules system – he wassn't trying to help me – he was trying to cut down on the time I spent doing something else during high school – calling up to bragf later in 2004.  He kept copies of my drawings – the start of the collection – he wasn't a friend – none of them were.   Mother tried to get me down there before – they wanted me down there so people could see me.   And I got fired there – first place in my life.  And he knew the rat fink who ran it – head of the foundation – and the visit from another while in 3rd year in CMU.  - So trust no one is agood motto.  He is an American American as well – several generations.  - Because he used Palladium – they were afraid of the computers.   How many more “smurfs” am I going to see?  Rat fink – very wealthy rat fink – relatively wealthy – local radio show host to CT called him that – that ties it in with another group- all roads lead to the crossroads – uggggghhhhh. - he iniated those games senior year and it was very odd.

seeing finally and it did take me a while – that perhaps the biggest issue that Pittsburgh had with me above all else is that it couldn't control me – that I did get myself into a lifestyle where something couldn't just and take away my freedom and that no one else could push on me and get me to do something I didn't want to do – and they want people in that mode – where they have a mortgage and like a career job and debts that mean they have to live like that OR if an artist that they are tied to a group and to clients that support them – a person who needs little income and has no great debts is not someone you can't control – my student loan is $200 at most and not that currently – if I wanted I could pay it off now – and they gathered that because I paid more than the monthly payment in Pittsburgh – so it's not even really what I said – what I did – etc etc that's the big problem – it is being free and not welded into the system in a way they can push on me.  Forehead resting on first two index fingers – it's blatant political control – many will feel – didn't you get that? – NO – Everything I read says that's not supposed to happen – the employee leaving the door open to the commercial store and the 4 year old got in and played with the toys in the store – Pittsburgh didn't lock the door – and they blame me.   But that anology also implies that any other place will have similar conditions – and I'm sorry that's not fully acceptable to me – in other every one of you is lying about the true circumstances and none of the laws are real, all the regions of the US exercise control like that and you'd do the same Pittsburgh did – where they were trying to push me into a career and a lifestyle I didn't want and so you don;t look at Pittsburgh and say you should never do that – to you it is just – they messed up and don't want to admit it.  So you wouldn't let me write free and clear either.  I don't know – and you're not talking – and even if you were I couldn't believe what you said anyway.   But law isn't really the law if what goes on goes on – it's a tool to use in certain cases, I am – like for control – I'll have to find out and I may not agree with decision and may reject it – but for blatant – just we are supposed to be able to force him to do whatever we want to – and if we can't – we're gonna kill him.  Rubbed bottom of nose with left index knuckle – there is an element of that in my case – not just – hating my ideas and this and that – they don't approve of letting young people wander about on their own – they want control of them and were under the dellusion that they had control of me.    And it's blatant poltical force and power and a community's very strong desire to rule itself with an iron fist – stronger than I ever imagined a human could have- like in ethics and morals-  to me being like that is very immoral – very destructive.   It also only works if you're quiet- because when a stand in for Rush Limbaugh tells me I'm going to the gym – I don;t get that that means mother is coming home with those heavy bags of salt and I will have to haul them – just like in Pittsburgh I missed their cues or only would understand them later.   Where you're saying something and you're not really saying something.   The US is going to have to decide what type of country it is going to be – I am not in a position to make the decision on that- but I will pass judgment as best I can from where I sit and if that carries weight so it does.   To raise me with one set of values my whole life and be lying to me the whole time – well good day.    The Corps the Corps is father and kill anyone who gets in its way – ho ho ho ho ho ho ho – I almost sound like Santa Claus. 

kfyo 8:50 EST 1/4/09 – even this show is interesting – caller with God on a real estate deal – it wasn't through clever economic manuevering – it was the grace of God – we want people deranged and thinking the world runs on strawberry shrotcake so they are easier to manipulate.  Whooppee.

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time – right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly – then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched – 8:13 Est – just can't stop it. Ho ho ho – right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that – and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days – figure out how to do this to people – wow.

the truth potentially – IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show – and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie – maybe not started by him – but he believed that too – that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care – ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY – THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS – IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT – THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO – IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn – they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know – much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds – 20 -30 east flying heading north – I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities – most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example – to make money he or they could just do another movie – or write a book – a charity is not – there is work and cost – like to take people's compalints and research them – even if the idea is to block the complaint – someone has to take and research it – and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it – licking upper lip and now coughing – one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be – that charities are easy money – a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY – THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL – YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months – or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior – there are potential others – a form of of population control – etc etc – in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity – OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class – to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society – really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money – cancer research instead of education funding – making education super expensive – conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end – you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead – I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization – like I can't believe it – it would so not demoncracy – I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces – we can pass any law we want to – I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment – coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going – the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus – the other stimuli did not stimulate well – the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others – then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade – this would include IL too – it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible – transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces – it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional – someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster – any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces – which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns – Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama – that does happen – but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing – with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction. 

FL -  had first MIA in gulf war which sort of explains things now. 

Spanish version jonah is also expensive on amazon – they are blocking messages they want to eliminate.   Repent or God will killl you is the message of Jonah. 

And when designing a new role playing game it's not really cool that you swipe from my mind what I am writing about and like try to find people who have already designed it – like games that exist that sue a feature I thought up – scratched the back of my head on the word cool in the first line – If coke and pepsi and the rest are so big on proprietary information – they certainly aren't respecting mine – I can;t even get into the computer format stage-  where the ideas go from roughly pencilled notes to being typed up – they're already lifted and people are trying to say - “we'll see they laready did this” - they have failed to show that, but like if you can do that to me, little prevents one from lifting ideas out of other people's heads in say major corporations – and clearly you want a double standard – it is illegal to do it to you – but with someone like me, you'll cheat and you steal it from my head and then claim it's yours.  Like you showed two games that incorporate – the first was a clear-  see she did it first with Battle Galactica, but it sounds a little different than what I have in mind.  Rubbing corners of with thumbs – each thumb on the correct side- touching thumbs as typing -  one part is similar – the other part is not.   The other seemed more friendly and more of a – they might be interested in what you have to say.  But yeah like it's one thing for political but you steal every idea I have even while you are ardent defenders of the patent system which of course becomes rubbish if you can read a person's ideas.  No it's more important than ever – but it's a complete fake – someone does invent things – but the claims could easily be falsified- it becomes fairer not to allow exclusionary claims which will actually prevent theft than allow theft – the person making the exclusionary claim may well be the thief.  Rubbing left eye with left middle finger.  Even in the spell recharge in unearthed arcana not quite what I do.  

I did wake up at 1am last night – but it was momentary – they tried to get me to go to the bathroom – but they didn't have anything more a notion than a need – I went back to sleep and woke 3:40 Est – their power on me is weak – the reason mother and they are so keen to get me out of the house-  the other telepaths have lost the connection and with my changes in appearance or something they can't do what they used to do – they may have gotten photos yesterday.  But yes they can no longer interrupt my  sleep the way they used to.  I do have to walk to the post office to return a package.  I could see if I could call for a pickup.  - also the tongue blisters – that stopped – a few – like in the last couple nights – a few seem to come temporarily – but they too weak – it only lasted like an hour or two.  - coughing – mother can only do so much on her own – and the reason she is key to get me outside is so that other telepaths can help – because right now they are getting neutralized to a large degree- perhaps they are holding – not over several days – the overnights issues are stopping-  during the day when mother is awake is what is left.  - had to rub right cheek and left wrist.  

Methane scrubbing Solar powered polar bear windfarm zoos – an invention for the new year – gets quadruple tax credits and is thus profitable by 2 cents per year of use.   But onhly if you factor in the payback back – the upfront cost is tremendous and the break even point occurs in year 3000.  

-Ah starting to sweat although I am lying on the floor – and just knocked the cup over and had to adjust things and the smell of my feces is wafting to my nose although it shouldn't be that strong anywhere near me – hi mom – try again – I know you will – dribbling sweat onto my makeswift pillow-  19:13 Est 1/3/08 – after or actually while thinking up the blurb above – had the intense need to urinate – held it till finish – but then couldn;t hold it in bathroom  completely until getting to the toilet – and also got the intense need to defecate – not much urination or defecation in the end – left my room quick – usually bring something to work on – a book – writing something in the bathroom – after urinating but before defecating I turn around to find mother climbing the stairs at 18:55 Est to shut the window shades – she usually does that 21:000 or 20:00 she is early and was trying to block me in the bathroom without anything to do so I chose to let thing be partially out in back put my pants back on and run to my bathroom and she was eyeing and checking it out – I can tell monday and if I choose the trek to the post office I cannot avoid could be fun.  They want revenge and I will be vulnerable then.  Unless someone blocks them – theystill hope that they can get under my skin enough to make me want suiciide or to flee or attack them – I remember a prison guard who an inmate dinged a certain way and he went under and committed suicide.   It's like that-  they know with most people there is a limit – a point past which they can't endure- they are hoping to find mine.   A blind search of force now-  it is not one event it is a constant barrage – more in many ways than the past-  wanted to add more – but not sure there was one thought – specific thoguht – one thing they do try suicide and thoughts of fleeing and thoughts of anger – injecting those and see how far they go – I had a few – one 20 minutes ago – right after getting here and thinking can't I do it to her – ooh like a prickle in the air – room shoke – not an earth tremor – odd – but can't I focus on her like she focuses me and sit up here and while she is in bed cause  her body to be wracked pain – as she would do to me – she can't do fully that – she plays with my bladder and rectum and sometimes pain and sometimes forcing me awake-  something I did to the room has allowed sleep – I don;t know – I had good sleep the last couple nights – she doesn't want that to be – maybe a little becasue it is new year's and my normal demons are out partying – gremlins I should say are out partying and are not attacking me like they do – coughed as I started that thought on the gremlins partying.   -  but god tells me I shouldn't try something like that.   I for now agree.   It is like being locked in a cage with a demon.   Or perhap a mind flayer is a more appropriate reference.  - i did rearrange my room today and sge peeked in – why does that help – is their some way to better fight her – should i rearanged my books and furniture before bed – could I effectively lbock them from hurting me at night if I did? - I know you probably know answers – she is not stronger – but she has direct visual and auditory access to me – and tries to use that to beat you  - if I knew what to do – could I fight her better – I get it that you don't want to sue technique – because that can be copied- but just putting up with it all – it drives them crazy – because they believe in dominating and if you refuse to let them domiunate you  - . . . . . .  

I was going to mention – Travolta lost his son – did he intend for me to die in the bathroom in a similar way to his son – did scientology try that? - Tom Cruise – last week -  the CIA has appeared many times recently in ads – which is new – or the increased frequency is new-  and it used to mean every time a death threat against me – and generally with them – it appears – if you attempt to kill someone under their protection – the attempt fails and someone you care aobut suffers a similar fate that you intended for your victim – it is a decent deterrant-  though in my case the attempts have not stopped. 

I'm finally getting – rubbing right edge of lips with right thubma nd burping – I am finally getting that the reason Pittsburgh  hates creativity and hates people who do things differently is not that necessariyl it wants to stop innovation – it just wants full control – like they don't really think the invention – they just don't want the invention because it stops them from controlling if there is another way around them  -it's not fully the intvention they hate – it's the loss of contorl – and they are too shortsighted to see beyond control – they want to box up your options so they can better control what you do – it's not really a moral objection as much as they hide it in that-  it is an objection that they can't control when they  want to – bubonic plague time.

 FOX superscout of the boy scouts who is apparently jewish (here was a last name of a relative given)  and was name dropping Warren Buffet and real estate - “we get to pick who shines” - in which I will reject my home country and file for political asylum in another one – if this is your answer to me 17:48 EST 1/3/09 – you're right I will tire eventually of the arguing game of why I have to keep pleeding for some semblance of justice and I know Obama feels he is going to use my past statements or something to force into jail or a mental institution and  IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE -  I may soon need diplomatic protection from my president from foreign government – swiss used to pass out citizenship to jews in Nazi germany-  I may need something similar.   I wanted something else down but it is forgotten – there were 5 ammendments broken – and its going to get shoved under the carpet -  he said in the interivew the sky is the limit you can be anything you want – and he – just the fact of scouting – which my parents kept me away from – the whole interview was a stab at me – so be it – and the same – this is rude – one of the reporters was the one with the former Israeli ambassador who was not in my opinion – overly diplomatic – no even more than that- or I wanted to say more than that -mother is trying to block it and it is almost tipping back – I will tire and leave this coutnry in time – AH – she was trying to block I got it- I am beginning to think after everything the government has allowed to occurr to me-  perhaps I owe it a challenge – by forcing its hand – if it wants me so much – than I will purposely disqualify myself from the presidency by becoming a foreign citizen so that the only way I could ever run for certain offices is if there were a constitutional ammendment which there should be anyway because the native born thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   I really should be the one planning my own future – and no one has made a convincing argument to the contrary.   I do not like the gaming and there is gaming – there is some need-  but they are hiding behind part of that it appears to get what they want.  And I'm not sure I want that.  I don;t want to make their job overly difficult, but I dont; want to be used either – I don't like he pushed into hero thing – it hasn't worked in the past.   I can mess up bad.  Too many people are enamored with that.  - maybe if I immigrated back you could change my name.  - Give me a new social security number – etc.

the only way I can see HAMAS being less popular is if the Palestinian authority is successful with it's territories and HAMAS appears to have squandered the future of the people – Gaza resembles Darfur including hostilities with the state near it – it's not a perfect resemblance but it is there – Darfur is not a stable situation and without some shift in politics or demographics – shift in demographics bluntly meaning the population changes its face – without one of those – there will not be peace in that region.  The hatred is too strong.   There is a reason HAMAS wins over the PLO- the situation will be interesting to see in 4 months-  or later – with respect if you have a way to make this anymore than a temprorary victory, you are very creative.   By achieving temporary peace the hatred wil foment – even if well-intentioned – no people likes having their government toppled at the will of their neighbor.  Would any of them trade living spaces to somewhere else.  - There is one place – integrate the population.  - And how accurate is Bush's picture? - That HAMAS is fully to blame – integration of the wrong sort will be perceived as trying to further destroy Palestine.   - Israel's moves so far will acheive a “temporary lull” - it will be very difficult to one destroy all HAMAS arms and two prevent HAMS from rearming though I may be wrong on that it depends what they do – but I would think that their actions currently only set up the conditions for a new cycle of violence – unless they add something else.  Again I want to see the situation 3-4 months from now. 

oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly – she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs – I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces – there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes – to rpevent issues-  have to look – of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep – that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com – amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on – the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up – by USPS from home – well this was going to amazon – same place – but I got a no – and I know the other reason why – if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something – of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender – so that eliminates that – what else was I thinking – they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure – it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem – but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com – ah – I wanted to say earlier – the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder – EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT – WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk – that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office – the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself – which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up – you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will – but you shouldn't of and – it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen – especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to – i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary – but we didn't want you to do things the way you were – we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE – SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY – MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED – SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking – and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else – just like bank of america – and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US – that is what is wanted – what I think Barack Obama intends to induce – get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt – while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier – but that is it – it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people – and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs – which isn't all that heavy – it's a rural route – not as rural as could be – but it isn't the city – it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules – I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well – and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine – that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again – putting her pen through it – it was weird – and she was one of theirs – that was the one where when I reported a missing package later – that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me – not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over – just implying it – came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast – there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad “petty” - on youtube – justify my love – like a virgin – Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned – that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example – you'd pull most of your videos – or at least some of the ones I know best – for a material girl – which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority – it's an intersting argument to make – very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09 – I did want to add for some – those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand – not all of them are the songs I like hte best – audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes – but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open – there si a reason I don't come out in the open – in fact – all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution – I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it – there is sort of this american – it's best if you don't ahve to hide – we want to see you – BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it – and you are kind of forcing me out into the open – and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result – and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes – yes it would be better in time – it isn't right now – for many reasons people cannot handle it – I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas – not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out – it may ahve been the only way – as I stated a few months ago – so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding – but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful – my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden – but you forced it – and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way – I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done – I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it – I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative – itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone – that may not be possible – but – I am worried that you are a planning a surprise – I don;t want antoher surprise – there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, “Give You Hell”
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects “Give You Hell” and “We Didin't Start the Fire” Billy Joel – Madonna – whether I like her or not – “Just Like a Prayer” – “Move Along” All Aermican Rejects - - “It Ends Tonight” All American Rejects – the Wendy's commercial - “Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show” - in fairness Madonna can do it in others – she can also hide a message in hers – the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it – like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture – for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to – I will a music video – the right one – not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times – until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them – teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing – butyet a music video many things go – the well done ones – I named them up top – or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish – EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy – the backround isn't wasted – the facial expressions aren't wasted – everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society – billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes – to some degree – but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation – a pop up window came up on the “abou” of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that – where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  “because you would have utter choas” - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se – but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not – they do convey messages – but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it – the groupings – I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all – have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe – itching my right knee with right fingers wildly – stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video – but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe – organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements – as I element teaching jobs – it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to “make it cool” - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them – the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.

So we halted war usable item trade with Japan before pearl harbor.  They were attacking other countries to prompt that.   There was apparently from what I saw a detailed plan on

Odd breathing – sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name – though one's married name – she kept her own name – but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me – even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor – what are you doing here? – I might ask ou the same question. 

I don't want – French – no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher – not language – French american – and there weren't many if any French American sudents – both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence – one from France – one in high school and one in CMU – music in elementary school – then 5th grade or 6th she was both years – I am skipping one there – I can't find something he did – things happened around him and were trigered by other children – one time – I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities – but 4 out of the 5 seemed – odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen – and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong – and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course – my failure was planned – and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  “You can do this with every group” - that's just it – no, I can't – it doesn't work with Indian professors – it doesn't work Italians – there are individual – but not 80% - 20% if that – I don't think it works with the Irish – there were some bad experiences – but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est – mother came up starting questioning me through the door – throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus – she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet – though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though – about how dangerous it is – though someone will try to make her seem right – she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with “move along” the song – but used by nice productions – you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong – passed gas as I started writing this – et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps – they don't like it – 8:39 EST 1/3/09 – don't ahve to take a trip to the post office – can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county – he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here – Dupage – no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't – next county over – it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that – have  my mind combine two names – so I can't see – it's partly familar and partly wrong – rubbed right side of face with right middle finger – well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to – but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents – being asked to eat the leftovers – twice in my life – once by the – where did he live northwest chicago – but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh – but he took the metro in – not metro – metra as they are two different systems in Chicago  – I visited there in 2004- the office is gone – but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do – it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004 – someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin – container – deep or potato something – again it seemed out of place – polish –  at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003 – a woman – night shift – but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german – it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean – I do not know what to think on Milan – he was a nexus – saw him twice – he got me out of chicago or his wife did – but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me – he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh – had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire – as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have – and I guess- like he released me – he manueverd my anger and he did – it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time – rubbed left ear with left middle finger – they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people – by race – and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh – I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town – Pittsburgh is a town in many ways – it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't – there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go – I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much – I did drive down to see him in Southwest – I jsut didn't park too well as usual – cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say – about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention – the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully “managed” by other groups in the coutnry – yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU – she probably helped a great deal – was I a test for Pittsburgh – it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon – whatever – was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue – high school and elementary – 2 instances each that I see – high school more – but 2 in elementary – and then Pittsburgh – the thread follows – in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person – but there were in elemenary and high – elemtary into junior – mother's election helper – she is running around now downstaits – I can't trace – Milan? - Chicago – I didn't know the names – the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral – I never suspected.  - 3 – oh wow – 3 – so much of this country hated me – driveways and odd trades – a one time incident – just happened – left no mark – just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me – but people from farther away – it wasn't an accident – none of it was an accident as early as – pretty early – it wasn't accidental – children aren't fully innocent for very long – the same people in one case where one thing happened – they would appear later – much later college from elementary school – I don't know what happens to others – in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random – very few – cause you can trace the same few classmates involved – i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it.  

3rd cia ad 18:34 EST 1/2/09 – kfyo – that is a first

btw – trying to tire me out and wear me down is the wrong answer to your problem – you do understand that right.

1 st trading day of 2009 – DJI Average Dow Jones while up – the chart is bumpy – whiel the nikkei is smoother oer was a few days ago – the US chart still has zig-zags – smaller ones-  but they are there – and that means fun and games – arbitrage – zig zags help arbitrage – but are not or SHOULD not be real- tooth ache a little by left bottom mid tooth on botton – hi mom . Ligh volume it was said so light arbitrage

Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

netflix – the government movie capital – yes – they have aligned with the children it appears – and they give me ads a lot – banner ads.  

what Japan's legitimate grievances (for WWII) ? – callwer – Nazi prisoners in US got movie passes – uncle didn'ty mention that – great uncle actually – we never met – only stories through parents -  firebombing of Dresden killed civillians – and he said nothing just a laugh – daughter could not drink – it is about the arsenic in the water in TN – which mother let me hear on NPR -  you don't mind it if I can't eat – now your daughter can't drink – amd I bet she can – but it's difficult – do unto others as you want them to do unto you is a Christina comnandment – did you “forget” that one with me ?  - perhaps you are being reminded – God likes that – if you would take away another's hosue than your hosue is taken away if you woudl deprive one of sustenance then yours is taken away.  17:44 EST 1/2/09

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking . There   Military interrogator of foreign military – is the caller.  

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

planned parenthood sent me a letter today

dsisease filled rats were in the vehicles of vietnam – double meaning taken – I wonder how those got so popular there – oh the witches at their best. 

Jenniefer – I think – doing my homework – that is what I started doing a minute ago in a sense – something besides listening alone - -

donny st louis – not responding to call

walmart bombthrat(bombthreat)  in TX – there are a few things going in walmart in lubbock these days – it coudl be connected – I would bet money on it at this point.  - all the activity at walmart discourages sales and certain higher class people who normally don't shop here and MIGHT WANT TO START - that is the way to stop them from starting  - walmart online might be an interesting tool to use with some.

Eliot spitzer hotel.  - for Obama – this occurred earlier. 


Phoenix Jim – 70 – auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not – govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need – we don't need them – we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here – and try to sell at premium in US – and in other coutnries they actually compete – they could price different in other countries than in US – and with Nafta – not NAFTA WTO – mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently – so big 3 – gouge US customers potentially – but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3 – make a plan – but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code – they all rate their education – and he slipped in something softly while I was typing – car thing – they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten – see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller – H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war – no we don't – we probably could “Create” an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii – do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout – militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami – charity – dumping thousands of shoes – I need shoes – sometimes – glue could be drying out – oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there – did someone figure that out – I didn't want to mention that – there is a backup shoe – unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family – sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight – could not get up – amber alert – silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo – ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris – they are like poison pills – the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken – but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point – others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA – people want to go snowboarding anyway – risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can. 

Jennifer  she was on a charity person – non-profitr worker – one of these was - – didn't complete a point – seemd to jump all over- may be making fun of what my wqriting sounds like – but she is on air – and that was an interesting call – I also wasn't typing on computer- which may be why she was not coherent-  she knew she wouldn't catc h me-  writing off computer which somehow I can listen and write off the computer better.   - started with thing about some liberal callers not stupid. 

TGIM – Thank God it's monday- we are still going to see plenty of fruicakes -  Travolta's son has died – that chruich scientology is not such a good thing – they lie. 

I got the brother of Obama and the aunt of Obama points on Limbaugh – a flwesh eating troll would be kinder to deal with as president.   The cia again 15:52 Est – on kfyo – their ads are more common and I am beginning to think it no longer signals what it used to. 

tax cuts drive economy – defucut spwedning gets an economy moving – Reagan did it – Jeff – he seemed to get angry as I elaborated on the last call -his tone got hostile – I wans't listening to him. -  caller Jeff - - I had a computer error which caused a lapse- 15:48 eSt 1/2/09

save money for a little while – this caller sounds almost pittsburgh – the diction on that – anybody who pays 0 taxes-  there are people who don't buy anyhting  - they pay no tax – yes so what the caller is trying to do is say my way of life will destroy everything – couldn't we just revise how taxes are collected -versus killing me off- if that is issue – I need a lot less services than people to because I don't own a home and it does reduce waste and not owning a car reduces use of gov't services so is it so unfair I pay little taxes-  the gov't power of Pittsburgh does not want to risk reducing size so it wanted o condition me against my will to spend more- but that is against the constitution and they “overlook” what is lost by taking hte attitude they have the right to condition me to spend more to float their gov't when they are losing people and city services aren't so necessary and perhaps they should cut jbos out of the city governmwent-  because they do have less people – and they try not to.   Tehy don;t want to hear later that will lead to more jobs- better o get rid of unproductive jobs- but Pittsburgh didn't work that way

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh – 1/2/09
Zaron – Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh – may know host – are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords – switched parties – on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse – in US over teacher awards – Canada – Quebec – politics flipping parties – Vermont – is not Granholm that is MI – telegenic – granholm is telegenic – what comes of her mouth does scare me though – and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA – Ken – tried to catch me with many numbers – pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems – I did not get down the 20,000 – I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score – so I got down the point – and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my “member” - first a sharp pain – when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears – the burning with a little pain – is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare – don't cure illnesses – want them to be chronic- a

Or I think – soicalized medicine – never heard you before are u english – I screwe up that question several months ago when i heard Mark Stein the first time.  - more MRI machies in philadelphia than in all of Canada – oh there's no black market-  yes – doctors become terrorism possibilities if they are immigrants – as mine was who was not american.  - and I did remember that.

I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing.

we're

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 – nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho – grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand – as I thought to wait – they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way – mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on – but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors – this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others – but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this – and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo – some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est – as soon as I tried to mail a second time – on yahoo mail. Hmmm – that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description – the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set – is – from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) – well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12 – I can't but though cuurently – I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high – considering other prices on other items

if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set

Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $35 – that is spiked – it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for – can be $25 maybe $30 – but $30 should be and not a players  handbook – I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release – someone is spiking this price – boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series .   The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price – these books are not baseball cards – this is very odd. 

Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $34 on new book – new is lower than a used

Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000)  low price  $3.15  - I own a copy of this now – but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for – the publicated dates are similar – not a decade apart- YET – the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other- 

Ravenloft is a horror series-  I just identified that as a no – no – BUT – the devil is in the details – a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well – like if someone wanted to caricature  oh a famous software CEO – I don;t know what is in 3.5 – but it is spiked – and the gamma world I got -

Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)
8 Used & new from $23.49   -  I do own this one now – similar to the amazon price – shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back – most dungeons and dragons go down  copyright 1996-  there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes – BUT – there is a story in here – it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups – it turned a forest planet into a desert – that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out – not a long book – 96 pages – I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 – but given what other D &D supplements there are – this is gets targeted – the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things – additional spells and this and that – few creatures – but nothing several different books don't contian – other books – many ohte books contain similar things-  wizard's handbook is similar.  - The history is the only thing I didn't have. 

The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more – it appears -  Bil gates destroying gamma world books – ho ho ho – yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book – by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb – Jeff was with Gary Gygax – he has been there a while -  copyright 2000 – 192 pages or so – oh – the cover I got is there – but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon – the book is on amazon – just not with the cover I have – or that is there too – but as a backup picture – not the main one shown – there is a different cover shown -
Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback)  - low price of  $24.95 – for the new book – the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens.  - I paid  $7.65 for mine on amazon on  12/16/08 – plusa shipping -  but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -

things like that can happen – but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -

why are books important – shutting of messages – Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable – many parables and like with defilers nad preservers – there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want – BUT – it had a message – severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest – and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first – people in the US first-  it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -

The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing -  BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE  - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved – many of those have been worthwhile – there are messages in them -

SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES – INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES-  I AM A REASON TOO – BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL – KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION – WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS – GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE – STORIES – so that all moral conditioning is controlled-  nifty huh – the technology revolution in operation right here.  - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well.   There is a modicum of material.   Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this.  - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games.   - yawning as I am about to email – scratching back of head too – with right hand – and scratched scab with left by left side of nose.   9:25 EST 1/2/09. 





All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com
I don't know if it – rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this – it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing – but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something.   People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever – in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product – scumbag.   I think the short version won't do – I don;t know the products before I buy them.  I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 – there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something  $4.75 I think or $4.79 – under $4 – the next price is $18 – on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong – I knew that – it was worth the risk – for that price – Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book – happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once – now  that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller – usually there wil lbe a bidding war.   Itching right thigh with right finers -  but in this case I ordered it-  I got the product – it looked great – but there was a lot of air in the box – huge box and not much inside – it was the Revised Edtion – box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms – Babylon 5 – when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online – like I even found a site – the attic I think a premium role playing game seller-  who previewed the first five pages – there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games – just a one line review – how to tie things in – the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 – and it had two small books – each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it – BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT  - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box – normally when one orders an item on amazon – amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items-  pages missing – so a ruelbook missing would count like that – but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside – I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff -  BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON – YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION – VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT – BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT – YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH – IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9  WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES – WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-  WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME – PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN – THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE – AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU  FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH – WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS.   Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.  
But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms – no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide – I was hoping  against hope to find a few page book preview – and I did – but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it – because it wasn't what I fully wanted – it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was – BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part.  But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price – I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box – so I didn't feel so cheated-  but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs – I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide – Babylon 5 – through amazon – and I wasn't initially planning to do that-  THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come – probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine – again the whoemver- government – will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time – or they come when something happens – but with the recent game too of – if it gets held and I didn't want it – then they want me to return it and get something else – so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund – actually cancel the order) – they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy – the other side flipped that on them – by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal – and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date – but in order to get me to return – like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy – the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take.   And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide – and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars.    Bit upper lip as I mentioned that.   So what happened – I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set.  Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly – this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end – movie references – there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 – I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller – that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted-  I had to go back to amazon to get info this time – no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time – but amazon had a page count ofor a box set – and I checked the page count of the item I ordered – against the pages I got and it is short a bit – I do not – I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed – which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon – where – they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes-  and it's your fault for not reading the note – that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes-  but it said in the notes it wasn't english – see you missed a detail – it's your fualt – versus – should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with?  -  Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference.  - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description – but he sold me a different item – that from the cover looked very similar – and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available.   And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick – of course  I get to rate him a second time as well.  - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale.    Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.   - I was putting more books in a box – and mother woke – up – the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again – because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in – they're all small boxes – and mother was up in a flash – like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books – which neatened things up a little – and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books.  I did throw one out several months back – but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.  But mother was up  here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell – german town where my fahter's family is from – we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII – and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me – and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car.  But we shall see – the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous – but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that.  She would have had to.   She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle – it would tag my computer-  she does that-  she had me order for christmas last year – this book she never read – a cartoony sort of physics – book which sat on our coffee table – she also has her own computer downstairs – she could look it up – she doens;t she asks me – I declined – she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance.   I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much -  I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me – when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out.   Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed – but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation – she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous – I mentioend that above – but saying it down here made mne catch the error above.  But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this – if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry-  I am trying to get prepared to deal with that.   You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time. 



wpht's audio stream links are working again – good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09

Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep – rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle.  The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too – and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day -  again we are taking the “gives you hell” from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you – not with just a we hate piece ot it. 

- education with levin – I did lose  -forgot what should go here – I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up – I do golf worse than the union memebers do.   At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think. 


businesses in CO suffered because of the “mad bomber” - let's get this straight – the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped-  but we get more money during the holidays – BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't – don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind – which is crazy.  It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays – it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is  harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business – why have a shot like that – we make more money-  but you do it for all the wrong reasons – and overall things would be better if it weren't done – less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well – and just bought when they wanted or needed something – through the year.  It works pretty well for me.   Versus – oh Christmas – gifts are good – gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people – because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same – most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no – “I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me” - stories – that is not the norm.

like if everything keeps – and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case – could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers – that might be itneresting? - they'd scream – we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is “too big to fail” - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering – though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job – but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me – they do “lean” on people not to do things and that is not legal – and like murders on buses – beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way.   Get more people to drive. 

the marines like “move along” from All American Rejects – I think although that one is good too  -my pick for explaining things would be “Gives You Hell” - one of these days we'll stop fighting – cause that is a central problem with a society – not picking one side over the other – but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST  - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending – he got it right – but society doesn't see that yet – they ot it right – bands are teams oo I guess. 

rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com.  Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09  16:10 maybe

Weaalth envy – listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation – shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth – the way he says it does reek of wealth envy – and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument – that people buy $500,000 parking spaces.    And indeed even in Colorado that seems like – someone set that up just to play with people-   And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value – too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods – that is true – weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything – the $500,000 NYC studio apartment – and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue – the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual “value” of each of those dollars – many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created – in truth – capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it – but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system – in short people cheat like anything on the market – and actually on several markets-  real estate is an issue.  Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping.  Or is only halted.   Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA – or does it go out of state – jsut a thought – west losing power – political power and financial power – even in CA – though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam.  But back to the first point-  I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws – you can only be so much wealthy – nor for – rubbed  right calf with left foot – coughed – passed gas – nor for – now I forget – I will get hat(that) one though – nor for – licked lips lower lip as I got it – nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy – I may think about that a bit-  not force – but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) – do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point – not sure on that – a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities – for very little good reason – but I am not for telling a perosn – don;t be ostentatious – you have to live this way -   the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure – the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US – as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO – and the elites to control and fix that market – prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs – there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay-  and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism – more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it – TWO – get rid of one central head like that and focus one person – that thinking will change – is chaing – freeware – it's not one perosn – it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out – but it will – that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis – who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public.   But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class – that fixes nothing – the guy is basically telling them – you can do it-  jsut be secret – our society has too many secrets -  I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales – in this age – I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it – I think that could yet be perfected.   It is sort of agaisnt the idea of “old capitlaism” - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product – better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory. 

But wealthy envy is an issue – people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up – the military is a good candidate for unions – that is scary – speak the language of bread – uggghh – but not the language of doing but of complying – but they don't know well enough -  um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list – he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever – he tried to kill me – or had others do it for him – or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate – and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president-  which theoretically can't happen legally – and he will do something to me with the power he has – he won't play by the rules -  there was a book on Dragon empires in space – which was kept cheap  in order to – it looked like what I wanted – but it was designed to assuage me – the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama – and suggest it will not be the end of the USA-  I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line – mother's foot mvoed too – can hear it – so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom -    got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else-  touched right index finger to left thumb – rubbing right calf with left foot – the middle class and class envy – people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 – the waste bothers me some – but I do not desire their life – for it seems foolish – the price paid.   If more people were satisfied with what they – the wealth envy issue would go away-  moeny in most cases is not the issue – it is dissatisfaction with life-  and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand.    And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned  on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere – I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade-  sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this – the price was right – I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully – it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide – like I don't know – was i getting hlepd or hurt – it appeared that i was getting helped-  I got two used books for the price of a new one – and at times – beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way – But uncertain – and the door just bumped-  the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide-  the definiton of the planets is not so good-  we shall see-   because the review for that guide on amazon – mentioning what I bought in the end – prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it – it was lower priced – that immediately draws some suspicion – again – but it could be for two reasons – one good – one bad – they do both – and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked-  the first batch – on the second – they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see – though one did not go through without a fight – they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids-  like as a gorup – I guess I will find out as things come in – itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger.  1/1/09 15:49 EST

about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com – got my first  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I got to the mail page  for the new year – 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est – joy oh rapture. 

1/1/09   


FOX – early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the “the beauty” of HI – the “beauty” of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me-  and I have to admit – when I went to HI – I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind – in addition – HI when I saw had bugs – there were none in the pictures – hmmm -  HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.   

On that note – Junea or Anchorage for state capital – sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute – as well as city officials -  AND – I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power – Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business  if it does – like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions – where – things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center – it won't give up the money or power – Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields – Itasca – than suburbs of Pittsburgh  - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes – my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money – and another near deletion occurred here-  seem to be doing a string of them – I never did them before-  that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it-  mother – I know gremlins can play with computers too – they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well.  - licking upper lip-  - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry – hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words – In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places – walmart and chicago mile – which is impossible without a car and  I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago.  Definitely not in Chicago – not even a walmart in Chicago – and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe – southwest – sam's in Evansville.  - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an “oversight” in their transit.  It was on the way to the airport.    Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger -  but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars – there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities -  $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado -  it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent – for the parking.   That is not a loop price.   And someone wants that revenue – versus having a stronger and better working transit system.   So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money.    - In my case people seem willing to kill over it.   Touching upper lip with tongue.

for the last email – the full version 

cbs news – touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me – technically barter should be illegal as I noted before – not without using the monetary system – they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their “friends” while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system – you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency – it should be the equivalent of counterfeit – that is the essence of what it is – coughing as I put that up.  It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another – and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it-  BUT – they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money – we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless – maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early – bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive – I nearly deleted this section – the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error – and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared – and a hacker is probably behind that – deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen – perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price – that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed  - But not allow simply exchanges between friends -  and my door bumped again.  Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 – total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway
--
Yes they Can  . . . . . threaten with Caillous

picked at random from first search list-  but not on the initial channel that I used for the other two - “Caillous” goes apple picking – I stayed away from the police officer and the fireman – which obvious bad chocies – this I thought was safe -
I have to go to the bathroom and am fighting that - 
in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy. 
How would that whole segment apply to me – I am that big apple they are trying to pick – pick nbefore it matures and hits the ground and gets bugs in it – the CIA – might be the bugs - - deer – i saw deer many deer in Pittsburgh – big deer hunting place – apples are a favorite treat of deer – deer like to eat apples – then they go into the different way once apples are picked and stopped from growing they can be used for many things – and caillous goes – I like mine all alone – kind of quick and dirty is how we're going to get you  - and the cleaning the garden in the spring reference – Pittsburgh – celaned me out of the city -and at the bar on Atwood Street – nto sure if it was the spring – but could have been  spring of 2005 or summer 2005 – a guy with the clean up Pittsburgh shirt on came by me out of the bar on atwood – and shirts were used for a lot messges.  Game Over  and dead men tell no tales – currently I see no one so I can't see a shirt.  Yes this is the last clip I saw – they can threaten me with caillou and caillou is negative-  the over clean aspect – the happy friendly playground – lady ellaine fairchild has been banished- even Mr Rogers had more evil in his show than this does.  Everyuone is happy and gets along.  From Canada..   I don;t Garfield – and I know he is corrupt too – but garfield had on the budedyt bears – who got along perfectly and they mocked on Garfield-  but he became an environmentalist and not a friend and i know that.  But that one aspect was so bad – The buddy bears looked fake for always getting along.  
Mother introduced me to Garfield. 
So in an instant search this is what I found – first record I didn't try much – they only had 30 seconds
“Garfield and Friends episode Return of the Buddy Bears”
- cleaning the house by getting rid of all the food – stiffing the buddy bears pay – the house is messy from Garfield - - no linking at all to me-  yes     EVERY SINGLE VIDEO i GET ON MY OWN IN YOUTUBE CAN BE MADE HOSTILE – AND WHAT THEY DID A MASSIVE BUYOUT ON ALL d & d AND RELATED STUFF ON AMAZON – BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCTS I WANT ARE OUT OF STOCK – though it is odd the shipping estimates on what i did order got revised upward.  From the 9th and the 14th to the 20th ordered couple days ago.    None of the items came. 

Other caillous episdoes here :

Dragon tamer episode in caillou – the dragon doesn't have to be bad and mean – kid playing him is older than other kids – well I watched caillou – on youtube – no idea what was going to be on it – it applies directly to me.  - threatened by PBS

Surprise Sleepover – power out on caillou because of rain storm – did someone leave the sprinkler on –  that is not a perfect reference-  but the bus driver I didn't like to state college and others in Pittsburgh – CCAC professor – non-credit business or math – when I would run somewhere and sweat up – they would joke – is it raining outside-  it was a pittsburgh thing to joke like that and the joke in caillou is similar – though that part is not exact – HOWEVER -  there is the rest of show – shadow by a light that the kids think are monsters but it's actually a cat – one cat's are referenced all over in Pittsburgh and even here – once in a while – and the shadow scaring the kid – kid being scared by the shadow a shadow – that was in a commercial earlier-  I did an email title- something like a kid being scared by shadows is called terrorism  - it's a past email – but a while ago – terrorism is in the title - - AND they pitched a tent in their house – I of course lived in a tent for a while in my apartment in Pittsburgh to prevent the spying – I didn't know at that time how it worked – how someone could do that – but pitching a tent like that in the middle of my room is probably an effective way to get rid of many problems – mother has referenced the tent several times in sort of derision – so it was effective.  - Okay that is two for two – they can threaten with caillou – with a random episode of a Pbs show from Canada – shown on youtube – like that is like a triple withcing hour on wallstreet – of course it's going to be threatening -
--
I had mostly quiet toys growing up – not so many ones that make noises.  - cayu – is not – it is quiet - - I have to watch it again – I was not overly fond – let me see it again.  

glenn has a point that states should have a point to break away from the govt peacefully – in all cases they should and do benefit from the union more than they lose by being part of it.  I do worry now – like who in a state gets to decide to break the union – like the founders did not believe the people should decide- so it is a legitimate question – my faith in the public to vote is a little shaken  -I would want like 2 votes from the public to leave the union a probation and then a final vote and a couple years between them. 

I am not a teacher's union fan- I would have to think a little whether they are more dangerous than organized crime – certainly – education is less affordable – seems to be less efficient – and has progressed less than other areas – and none of that is to their credit -and they did screw up with me too. 

boortz – are u doing praganda for Hamas?

I think it may be an established law of government now – that the faster a spending  bill is passed – the LESS practically the money will be spent by the Government and the MORe money will be in the bill too – how about 2 Trillion dollars in 2 days.  - with this current value in dollar – not a deflated FUTURE dollar amount please – following the 700 buillion bailout we have a trillion – what does this suggest? 

How does poker like provide value to the economy - like it sucks money out of people who otherwise may not give it - that is somewhat practical -

and if you guys don't want me to leave the house until Jan 20th - that is okay with me.

the TRILLION dollar stimulus plan cannot be practically put together in a week – well it's not a practical idea either so that whole thing has a nice cycle together doesn't it?

can pets smoke legal marijuana and walk at the same time in Ca – and I know in CA that case amy come up - the CA governor's office is the only one I know of to have animal issues as a possible topic  - however I don;t deal with NY, WA, or OR much these days - there may be others -

Gambling has downsides – both created jobs are not great – and then you create the MIT people who live to play poker- not a good class to create.

politicians don't like you if they lose and you were loyal to their winning opponent – um I woulldn't anything about that – fundraising for John Kerry and voting for George Bush and being honest about it in the beginning – in 2004 – I know nothing about that – politicians don't seek revenge- what – ya kidding me – nothing that happened to me looks like revenge? -  Are you kddin' me – it all looks normal.  Voted against carry – salray cut to a quarter of former amount -  alright alright. 

odd window popped up while filling in the clintonfounation.org contact form out - talked about a script running and asked me if I wanted to continue it or cancel - I picked cancel and everything was okay - just it was itneresting. 

patches was a famous pet of someone – is it the companion of socks the cat ?  Mother named the cat cabomba – so that is where my fluency with languages may come from – I just thought people gave pets unusal names versus object names. .  

Al Franken aas a Senator !!!!?????? - Somehow the quote “guilty as sin free as a bird” comes to mind. 

I noticed how the congressman answered the question of being Senator – if that is his worst crime – give him some coupons for those restaurantsthat are on your site as a punishment.  - kfyo - 

2 paste errors on hutchison.senate.gov 8:50 EST - 1/5/09 - 3rd time successful. 

burris has to run for reelection in 2 years.

with Chicago you would have to prove intent – and that will be difficult – but yes the system failed and it is “odd”

on the 5th and 14th ammendments - the doctors can force you to pay medical bills - like when you are under court order- they tell you to get medication and by court order you have to get it and in my case pay for it.  And yes that is property or money - i ahve to pay it isn;t in the court truling - the court didn't designate me to pay for medication - it designated doctor treatment - - the doctor then can prescribe whatever he wants - you are saying technically that may be a right violation - in addition they did take property - they - by their actions they did - the hospital and the city - the police did deprive me of property and never reimbursed me for it.   it's been 4 years - - end of 2005 - 3 years.  - the bus ticket that went bad because of forced hospitalization worth $300-400 dollars.  - time expired on it while in hospital.

I did write in the browser randy.senate.gov partway – and caught it – 8:39 eSt 1/5/09

We keep having references to the “fun” civil war ammendments-  the 14th ammendment is highly interesting – section 3 in particular – could he do that – he could – oh wow – and in a suit in a heartbeat that would flip – things – and it woudl bealmost cooler to announce the count and then invalidate them and elect the other person.  -

I note that the city of Chicago violated my 14th ammendment rights – when it “lost” myy motor voter application and I could not vote in the congressional 1998 election because of it – if I can prove intent and their might be intent – in addition section 1 of the 14th ammendment could be added to my case against Pittsburgh due to forfeited property and infringement of liberty – mother is going nuts downstairs – banging of door and motion – so yes the 14th applies to me in 2 different cases  - plus the federal implications – why am I having visions of like a thermo-nuclear explosion politically hitting the north – the equivalent of that – oh wow.   Not a real bomb – but just – I am getting – they are so far over the line – this still all seems like fiction at this point – it is beyond belief..  But yeah that ammendment applies to – we have 6 ammendments that were broken so far known - 1st , 4th 5th, 6th , and 8th , and now 14th – do I hear 7 ? - coughing badly. 

- I did have problems with icy and blurry windshields in cars in CT and IL – in IL I coudln't see in the sun from the streaks on my windshield at one point-  I remember that day – I was driving and I couldn't see out of the windshield -  that's not a good thing – no it's not – which is why I didn't very much – things would happen  - oh the car the AAA guy – who was russian or slavick by accent and who made getting the jump to move my car a huge problem nearly ran into him which would have been a problem – he was giving me bad instruction – constantly calling me an idiot and it seemed while he was standing behind the car in front of mine – parallel parked on those lovely Chicago streets by lake michcagan about 6000 North of downtown – Bryn Mawr- forehead resting on first two finger joints of right hand -  I thought he was telling me to put my foot on the gas to start the car and take foot off the emergency break and he kept calling me an idiot – this is the triple A person – you know when you can call – how stupid are you any way – and there was a witness family – I just was very careful and I didn't hit him but the family who owned the home was watching and were perfect witnesses – I was set up and “got lucky” - nothing happened – I still felt bad – I could have hurt him – didn;t want to – he put me in a situation by the way he acted with no visible witnesses to help me – where I almost injured him – it would have changed my life – there was no reason he had to stand right in front of my car – but he did – he set up an accident condition.  And yes he was slavick – I said Russian – maybe – could easily have been another slavik – But yes problems witth windshield wiper blades flying off the car – not working properly during heavy CT rainstorms and then during winter.  Frosted windshields in CT definitely a problem – rested forhead on first to finger joints again.  -  I called triple A when my car wouldn't start in Chicago and this is what happened – I never had “good luck” when people looked at my car – except for buying it and my first boss literally took me car shopping to a person he knew.  - not knowing how to use an automatic teller from drive through in a car. 

A colleague of mine in CMU – suction.com – and the indian in my class for two years – tried to get me to apply and go to Cooper Union and go there – in the year off – mother was against it – it sounded neat to me the way my two former classmates presented it -

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

After looking at Al-Jazeera – where Hamas is saying the justficiation of the deaths of Israeli children is validated -Israel did pick this time to “get peace for its citizens” - - I will be itnerested to see how the “fundamental  situation” changes because of current actions – I wouldthink things will just repeat themselves unless Israel is extremely clever – and I am not usre that will happen – once Hamas is cleared out -won'tit just came back – I already commented that the timing of this as the US government changes – is highyl suspicious – I now udnerstnad 500 people is not even 1% of 400,000 – so someone is at least being somewhat careful – with the atttackers and the situations Israel has – developig – non-lethal means of arresting perpetrators and  capturing them – our governemtn did not look at that carefully – and should have – Israel has much more incentive – yes a teenage Palestinian can kill an Israeli soldier with whatever – do you still want to be the one to explain to his family why their son was killed by grown soldiers? -  So if you could keep them alive and incapacitate them to sort things out – less resentment would be created – I watched as it looked like our military vetoed that idea in favor of lethal technology which of course was only so effective in somalia and in other close combat places where you have to deal with the families of the people you just murdered – there is a time when death is needed – but how much and when are at question and our military basically said – we prefer to kill than th use non-lethal technology it appeared – or I haven't heard a good ocunterargument as to why non-lethal technology has not been developed in 20-30 years?  That is what could be better and I would bet our military isn't the only one who underneath may prefer dead enemies to incapacitated ones.  - I will watch – it's not mine to act – It is Israel's call.

Yes they Can  . . . . . threaten with Caillous

picked at random from first search list-  but not on the initial channel that I used for the other two - “Caillous” goes apple picking – I stayed away from the police officer and the fireman – which obvious bad chocies – this I thought was safe -
I have to go to the bathroom and am fighting that - 
in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy. 
How would that whole segment apply to me – I am that big apple they are trying to pick – pick nbefore it matures and hits the ground and gets bugs in it – the CIA – might be the bugs - - deer – i saw deer many deer in Pittsburgh – big deer hunting place – apples are a favorite treat of deer – deer like to eat apples – then they go into the different way once apples are picked and stopped from growing they can be used for many things – and caillous goes – I like mine all alone – kind of quick and dirty is how we're going to get you  - and the cleaning the garden in the spring reference – Pittsburgh – celaned me out of the city -and at the bar on Atwood Street – nto sure if it was the spring – but could have been  spring of 2005 or summer 2005 – a guy with the clean up Pittsburgh shirt on came by me out of the bar on atwood – and shirts were used for a lot messges.  Game Over  and dead men tell no tales – currently I see no one so I can't see a shirt.  Yes this is the last clip I saw – they can threaten me with caillou and caillou is negative-  the over clean aspect – the happy friendly playground – lady ellaine fairchild has been banished- even Mr Rogers had more evil in his show than this does.  Everyuone is happy and gets along.  From Canada.   I don;t Garfield – and I know he is corrupt too – but garfield had on the budedyt bears – who got along perfectly and they mocked on Garfield-  but he became an environmentalist and not a friend and i know that.  But that one aspect was so bad – The buddy bears looked fake for always getting along.  
Mother introduced me to Garfield. 
So in an instant search this is what I found – first record I didn't try much – they only had 30 seconds
“Garfield and Friends episode Return of the Buddy Bears”
- cleaning the house by getting rid of all the food – stiffing the buddy bears pay – the house is messy from Garfield - - no linking at all to me-  yes     EVERY SINGLE VIDEO i GET ON MY OWN IN YOUTUBE CAN BE MADE HOSTILE – AND WHAT THEY DID A MASSIVE BUYOUT ON ALL d & d AND RELATED STUFF ON AMAZON – BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCTS I WANT ARE OUT OF STOCK – though it is odd the shipping estimates on what i did order got revised upward.  From the 9th and the 14th to the 20th ordered couple days ago.    None of the items came. 

Other caillous episdoes here :

Dragon tamer episode in caillou – the dragon doesn't have to be bad and mean – kid playing him is older than other kids – well I watched caillou – on youtube – no idea what was going to be on it – it applies directly to me.  - threatened by PBS

Surprise Sleepover – power out on caillou because of rain storm – did someone leave the sprinkler on –  that is not a perfect reference-  but the bus driver I didn't like to state college and others in Pittsburgh – CCAC professor – non-credit business or math – when I would run somewhere and sweat up – they would joke – is it raining outside-  it was a pittsburgh thing to joke like that and the joke in caillou is similar – though that part is not exact – HOWEVER -  there is the rest of show – shadow by a light that the kids think are monsters but it's actually a cat – one cat's are referenced all over in Pittsburgh and even here – once in a while – and the shadow scaring the kid – kid being scared by the shadow a shadow – that was in a commercial earlier-  I did an email title- something like a kid being scared by shadows is called terrorism  - it's a past email – but a while ago – terrorism is in the title - - AND they pitched a tent in their house – I of course lived in a tent for a while in my apartment in Pittsburgh to prevent the spying – I didn't know at that time how it worked – how someone could do that – but pitching a tent like that in the middle of my room is probably an effective way to get rid of many problems – mother has referenced the tent several times in sort of derision – so it was effective.  - Okay that is two for two – they can threaten with caillou – with a random episode of a Pbs show from Canada – shown on youtube – like that is like a triple withcing hour on wallstreet – of course it's going to be threatening -

Selling Cold medicines during winter does make some sense - but we are hainvg quite a few coughing people or sick people by sound in ocmmercials on kfyo - take your temperature-  cough syrup - cough medication - staying awake or fresh breath with smart mouth moutwash -  SNL is now making the commercials on kfyo it would seem - And there is health concern after health concern on kfyo.  14:04 EST 1/5/09

I had mostly quiet toys growing up – not so many ones that make noises.  - cayu – is not – it is quiet - - I have to watch it again – I was not overly fond – let me see it again.  

glenn has a point that states should have a point to break away from the govt peacefully – in all cases they should and do benefit from the union more than they lose by being part of it.  I do worry now – like who in a state gets to decide to break the union – like the founders did not believe the people should decide- so it is a legitimate question – my faith in the public to vote is a little shaken  -I would want like 2 votes from the public to leave the union a probation and then a final vote and a couple years between them. 

I am not a teacher's union fan- I would have to think a little whether they are more dangerous than organized crime – certainly – education is less affordable – seems to be less efficient – and has progressed less than other areas – and none of that is to their credit -and they did screw up with me too. 

boortz – are u doing praganda for Hamas?

I think it may be an established law of government now – that the faster a spending  bill is passed – the LESS practically the money will be spent by the Government and the MORe money will be in the bill too – how about 2 Trillion dollars in 2 days.  - with this current value in dollar – not a deflated FUTURE dollar amount please – following the 700 buillion bailout we have a trillion – what does this suggest? 

How does poker like provide value to the economy - like it sucks money out of people who otherwise may not give it - that is somewhat practical -

and if you guys don't want me to leave the house until Jan 20th - that is okay with me.

the TRILLION dollar stimulus plan cannot be practically put together in a week – well it's not a practical idea either so that whole thing has a nice cycle together doesn't it?

can pets smoke legal marijuana and walk at the same time in Ca – and I know in CA that case amy come up - the CA governor's office is the only one I know of to have animal issues as a possible topic  - however I don;t deal with NY, WA, or OR much these days - there may be others -

Gambling has downsides – both created jobs are not great – and then you create the MIT people who live to play poker- not a good class to create.

politicians don't like you if they lose and you were loyal to their winning opponent – um I woulldn't anything about that – fundraising for John Kerry and voting for George Bush and being honest about it in the beginning – in 2004 – I know nothing about that – politicians don't seek revenge- what – ya kidding me – nothing that happened to me looks like revenge? -  Are you kddin' me – it all looks normal.  Voted against carry – salray cut to a quarter of former amount -  alright alright. 

odd window popped up while filling in the clintonfounation.org contact form out - talked about a script running and asked me if I wanted to continue it or cancel - I picked cancel and everything was okay - just it was itneresting. 

patches was a famous pet of someone – is it the companion of socks the cat ?  Mother named the cat cabomba – so that is where my fluency with languages may come from – I just thought people gave pets unusal names versus object names. .  

Al Franken aas a Senator !!!!?????? - Somehow the quote “guilty as sin free as a bird” comes to mind. 

I noticed how the congressman answered the question of being Senator – if that is his worst crime – give him some coupons for those restaurantsthat are on your site as a punishment.  - kfyo - 

2 paste errors on hutchison.senate.gov 8:50 EST - 1/5/09 - 3rd time successful. 

burris has to run for reelection in 2 years.

with Chicago you would have to prove intent – and that will be difficult – but yes the system failed and it is “odd”

on the 5th and 14th ammendments - the doctors can force you to pay medical bills - like when you are under court order- they tell you to get medication and by court order you have to get it and in my case pay for it.  And yes that is property or money - i ahve to pay it isn;t in the court truling - the court didn't designate me to pay for medication - it designated doctor treatment - - the doctor then can prescribe whatever he wants - you are saying technically that may be a right violation - in addition they did take property - they - by their actions they did - the hospital and the city - the police did deprive me of property and never reimbursed me for it.   it's been 4 years - - end of 2005 - 3 years.  - the bus ticket that went bad because of forced hospitalization worth $300-400 dollars.  - time expired on it while in hospital.

I did write in the browser randy.senate.gov partway – and caught it – 8:39 eSt 1/5/09

We keep having references to the “fun” civil war ammendments-  the 14th ammendment is highly interesting – section 3 in particular – could he do that – he could – oh wow – and in a suit in a heartbeat that would flip – things – and it woudl bealmost cooler to announce the count and then invalidate them and elect the other person.  -

I note that the city of Chicago violated my 14th ammendment rights – when it “lost” myy motor voter application and I could not vote in the congressional 1998 election because of it – if I can prove intent and their might be intent – in addition section 1 of the 14th ammendment could be added to my case against Pittsburgh due to forfeited property and infringement of liberty – mother is going nuts downstairs – banging of door and motion – so yes the 14th applies to me in 2 different cases  - plus the federal implications – why am I having visions of like a thermo-nuclear explosion politically hitting the north – the equivalent of that – oh wow.   Not a real bomb – but just – I am getting – they are so far over the line – this still all seems like fiction at this point – it is beyond belief.  But yeah that ammendment applies to – we have 6 ammendments that were broken so far known - 1st , 4th 5th, 6th , and 8th , and now 14th – do I hear 7 ? - coughing badly. 

- I did have problems with icy and blurry windshields in cars in CT and IL – in IL I coudln't see in the sun from the streaks on my windshield at one point-  I remember that day – I was driving and I couldn't see out of the windshield -  that's not a good thing – no it's not – which is why I didn't very much – things would happen  - oh the car the AAA guy – who was russian or slavick by accent and who made getting the jump to move my car a huge problem nearly ran into him which would have been a problem – he was giving me bad instruction – constantly calling me an idiot and it seemed while he was standing behind the car in front of mine – parallel parked on those lovely Chicago streets by lake michcagan about 6000 North of downtown – Bryn Mawr- forehead resting on first two finger joints of right hand -  I thought he was telling me to put my foot on the gas to start the car and take foot off the emergency break and he kept calling me an idiot – this is the triple A person – you know when you can call – how stupid are you any way – and there was a witness family – I just was very careful and I didn't hit him but the family who owned the home was watching and were perfect witnesses – I was set up and “got lucky” - nothing happened – I still felt bad – I could have hurt him – didn;t want to – he put me in a situation by the way he acted with no visible witnesses to help me – where I almost injured him – it would have changed my life – there was no reason he had to stand right in front of my car – but he did – he set up an accident condition.  And yes he was slavick – I said Russian – maybe – could easily have been another slavik – But yes problems witth windshield wiper blades flying off the car – not working properly during heavy CT rainstorms and then during winter.  Frosted windshields in CT definitely a problem – rested forhead on first to finger joints again.  -  I called triple A when my car wouldn't start in Chicago and this is what happened – I never had “good luck” when people looked at my car – except for buying it and my first boss literally took me car shopping to a person he knew.  - not knowing how to use an automatic teller from drive through in a car. 

A colleague of mine in CMU – suction.com – and the indian in my class for two years – tried to get me to apply and go to Cooper Union and go there – in the year off – mother was against it – it sounded neat to me the way my two former classmates presented it -

I am an only child as well. 

craddock in TX did the redistricting – that wasn't the most equitable thing as I know of it. 

can we kick Austin out of Texas – um kinda a national problem right now kids is that too many people want to do that sort of stuff on a national scale.

A Middle Eastern Alamo?
I am not a good judge with Israel – I gave my theory – I do stick by it – the people of Gaza will remember this for a long time – and will feel – or I would feel less remorse at striking at Israel if I were one of them after an incident like this – isn't that a problem?   Have your really worked fully on methods to abduct or capture the people you deem responsible for the bombing without harming the rest of the population? - These pictures invite world outrage – Israel must know that – like almsot yhou are baiting the world to react – in honesty – like the Us(US) and colombia – when (you) do raids – don't you try to hit hard and fast minimize troop exposure to danger – get the targets quickly versus dragging out a campaign – I do not udnerstand any longer and have to again raise a flag-   What are you doing – besides levelling a city it looks like.  (unless this is the only way).

the mastermind of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, exhorted Palestinians to "crush" Israeli forces and to target Israeli civilians – that an interesting line -

and their rocket attacks concur with that – so the problem is that the leaders are hidden and the civillians are protecting them – would any of the civillians leave with the Israelis- into refugee camps while other business was going on in the city?   To clear the civillians not involved out of the way – or is that too hard to discern – I guess long term – if you are doing this it does make sense to be thorough -  i hope that it achieves the best outcome – again I think that if you did that to me – if you bombed me and forcibly took away the people i elected – maybe the election was done through terror – but that would encourage resentment that would not go away.   Do you have a second part after clearing out the people who may well just want to kill Israelis ?   Scratching back of head with right hand – you did say a permanent change in the situation.

60 Minutes – the wire for my keyboard is loose – I should have a still working spare and this one still works – yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer – it is “odd” how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV – itching – left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth – I was feeling aversion to writing this up – it is going now – maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney – said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time – my old license pla from Chicago – someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there – worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer – neat trick – the lights do blink – num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like – happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate – NY Prosecutor “deterring” drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder – this is a highly troubling story – and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems – the rammifications are not so simple – I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver – but as I cough up a little phlegm – here's the thing on this – I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude – bury him under the court – very vengeful – and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that – Someone is cackling somewhere – because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone – and that is the point – BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be – we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one – you can't win – be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink – he or she wasn'tr thinking – they lost control of the vehicle – and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case – a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident – the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown – it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent – to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case – you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women – but men may drink more – be expected to drink in more situations – I don;t know the stats – but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink – I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving – But the issues is – drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to – unless . . . .. intent can be determined – which in honesty even right now I bet it can – but not in a way that is admissable in court – but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing – the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink – it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk – that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along – he always made a big deal about that – I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish – when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me – it bristled me quite a bit – today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt – but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while – it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in – it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me – my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years – but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner – and I wouldn't have ordered there without him “meniktoning” it to me – and I didn't like – food was fine – it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk – I know with drugs – a professor bascially endorsed it by being there – and also smoking – it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving – second one – with brownies – funny brownies – I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor – we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it – again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases – with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs – and that is the big problem – oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs – and they probably could if they wanted to somehow – but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading – it has been done for quite a well – but we are talking about CMU – and trusting the wizards of CMU – DON'T – at least not at first – while brain patterns may be critical – I see a flaw in the study – but the premise can brain patterns be read – from my experience it certainly appears so – so the premise is not fully flawed – there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues – do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful – to me – I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003 – there was a MRI of my brain – well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005 – like in 2002 or 2003 – there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff – but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test – the computer images didn't come up – and the person – female – dark hair – did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial – the data was wasted – because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons – like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B – C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study – because my data was thrown out – yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that – MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes – though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking – school pyschologist at CCAC – in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution – we were talkign about medication – he used the phrase won't you try a little bit – and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me – on Dec 23 2005 – used the same phrase – won;t you try a little bit – when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no – in the emergency room – I did not say not – and I said maybe and maybe even yes – because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them – that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor – that female – reminded me of Jessica Lynch – from DAM – odd thing there.  Just a coincidence.

India the cat has died and in the (blank)  Ashwanttaman the elephant and not the hero gets killed.   I can't think of the stories name – Vedha - - Baghavad-Ghita – tiching left thigh with left hand as I come up with that.   ASHWANTAMAN GETS KILLEDI NTHE BATTLE IN THE bAGHAVAD -GITA -  again capitalization error – it's a trick by the “good” pandoba to bring down deetra- rashtra – so victory right now may not be too pure – understood. 

Blind CIA Head Why Not
so we appointed a Cia chief who is ignorant of spying – going for the equal opportunity CIA – where you don't have to know how to catch the bad guys – GIVEN that obama has ties to known terrorists and he appointed a potentially espionage challenged person to head the CIA – oh this just gets better and better

diarrhea and a bloddy nose – is that what they tried to do to me – mother moved and is speaking.  14:54 EST – suggesting you're right.

Yes they Can  . . . . . threaten with Caillous

picked at random from first search list-  but not on the initial channel that I used for the other two - “Caillous” goes apple picking – I stayed away from the police officer and the fireman – which obvious bad chocies – this I thought was safe -
I have to go to the bathroom and am fighting that - 
in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

so a few things disappeared from my list on amazon.com  - ho ho

itching back of neck as I email governor richardson with right hand.  15:29 Est 1/5/09

someone shut off my internet connection 15:20 Est – I was going to say in time perhaps having someone who is deaf and blind as CIA chief may be possible – with different assistance – but not right now – and having someone who is potetnially ineffective as head of the CIA is “highly problematic” at this time.  - had to restart firefox web browser to regain internet – they may not like my new setup- figured out a new trick. 

yes I used to play tennis. 

India the cat has died and in the (blank)  Ashwanttaman the elephant and not the hero gets killed.   I can't think of the stories name – Vedha - - Baghavad-Ghita – tiching left thigh with left hand as I come up with that.   ASHWANTAMAN GETS KILLEDI NTHE BATTLE IN THE bAGHAVAD -GITA -  again capitalization error – it's a trick by the “good” pandoba to bring down deetra- rashtra – so victory right now may not be too pure – understood. 

Why not Appoint Helen Keller as CIA Chief ?  - I realize the handicapped are discriminated against with that statement – but I think the point caries and no one who is deaf and blind should be CIA chief
Blind CIA Head Why Not
so we appointed a Cia chief who is ignorant of spying – going for the equal opportunity CIA – where you don't have to know how to catch the bad guys – GIVEN that obama has ties to known terrorists and he appointed a potentially espionage challenged person to head the CIA – oh this just gets better and better

diarrhea and a bloddy nose – is that what they tried to do to me – mother moved and is speaking.  14:54 EST – suggesting you're right.

went to hannity.com – meant to go to hutchison.senate.gov – and I capitlized most of this line by accident and retyped it – 1/5/09 14:38 Est.

in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy. 
How would that whole segment apply to me – I am that big apple they are trying to pick – pick nbefore it matures and hits the ground and gets bugs in it – the CIA – might be the bugs - - deer – i saw deer many deer in Pittsburgh – big deer hunting place – apples are a favorite treat of deer – deer like to eat apples – then they go into the different way once apples are picked and stopped from growing they can be used for many things – and caillous goes – I like mine all alone – kind of quick and dirty is how we're going to get you  - and the cleaning the garden in the spring reference – Pittsburgh – celaned me out of the city -and at the bar on Atwood Street – nto sure if it was the spring – but could have been  spring of 2005 or summer 2005 – a guy with the clean up Pittsburgh shirt on came by me out of the bar on atwood – and shirts were used for a lot messges.  Game Over  and dead men tell no tales – currently I see no one so I can't see a shirt.  Yes this is the last clip I saw – they can threaten me with caillou and caillou is negative-  the over clean aspect – the happy friendly playground – lady ellaine fairchild has been banished- even Mr Rogers had more evil in his show than this does.  Everyuone is happy and gets along.  From Canada.   I don;t Garfield – and I know he is corrupt too – but garfield had on the budedyt bears – who got along perfectly and they mocked on Garfield-  but he became an environmentalist and not a friend and i know that.  But that one aspect was so bad – The buddy bears looked fake for always getting along.  
Mother introduced me to Garfield. 
So in an instant search this is what I found – first record I didn't try much – they only had 30 seconds
“Garfield and Friends episode Return of the Buddy Bears”
- cleaning the house by getting rid of all the food – stiffing the buddy bears pay – the house is messy from Garfield - - no linking at all to me-  yes     EVERY SINGLE VIDEO i GET ON MY OWN IN YOUTUBE CAN BE MADE HOSTILE – AND WHAT THEY DID A MASSIVE BUYOUT ON ALL d & d AND RELATED STUFF ON AMAZON – BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCTS I WANT ARE OUT OF STOCK – though it is odd the shipping estimates on what i did order got revised upward.  From the 9th and the 14th to the 20th ordered couple days ago.    None of the items came. 

Other caillous episdoes here :

Dragon tamer episode in caillou – the dragon doesn't have to be bad and mean – kid playing him is older than other kids – well I watched caillou – on youtube – no idea what was going to be on it – it applies directly to me.  - threatened by PBS

Surprise Sleepover – power out on caillou because of rain storm – did someone leave the sprinkler on –  that is not a perfect reference-  but the bus driver I didn't like to state college and others in Pittsburgh – CCAC professor – non-credit business or math – when I would run somewhere and sweat up – they would joke – is it raining outside-  it was a pittsburgh thing to joke like that and the joke in caillou is similar – though that part is not exact – HOWEVER -  there is the rest of show – shadow by a light that the kids think are monsters but it's actually a cat – one cat's are referenced all over in Pittsburgh and even here – once in a while – and the shadow scaring the kid – kid being scared by the shadow a shadow – that was in a commercial earlier-  I did an email title- something like a kid being scared by shadows is called terrorism  - it's a past email – but a while ago – terrorism is in the title - - AND they pitched a tent in their house – I of course lived in a tent for a while in my apartment in Pittsburgh to prevent the spying – I didn't know at that time how it worked – how someone could do that – but pitching a tent like that in the middle of my room is probably an effective way to get rid of many problems – mother has referenced the tent several times in sort of derision – so it was effective.  - Okay that is two for two – they can threaten with caillou – with a random episode of a Pbs show from Canada – shown on youtube – like that is like a triple withcing hour on wallstreet – of course it's going to be threatening -

I had mostly quiet toys growing up – not so many ones that make noises.  - cayu – is not – it is quiet - - I have to watch it again – I was not overly fond – let me see it again.  

glenn has a point that states should have a point to break away from the govt peacefully – in all cases they should and do benefit from the union more than they lose by being part of it.  I do worry now – like who in a state gets to decide to break the union – like the founders did not believe the people should decide- so it is a legitimate question – my faith in the public to vote is a little shaken  -I would want like 2 votes from the public to leave the union a probation and then a final vote and a couple years between them. 

I am not a teacher's union fan- I would have to think a little whether they are more dangerous than organized crime – certainly – education is less affordable – seems to be less efficient – and has progressed less than other areas – and none of that is to their credit -and they did screw up with me too. 

boortz – are u doing praganda for Hamas?

I think it may be an established law of government now – that the faster a spending  bill is passed – the LESS practically the money will be spent by the Government and the MORe money will be in the bill too – how about 2 Trillion dollars in 2 days.  - with this current value in dollar – not a deflated FUTURE dollar amount please – following the 700 buillion bailout we have a trillion – what does this suggest? 

How does poker like provide value to the economy - like it sucks money out of people who otherwise may not give it - that is somewhat practical -

and if you guys don't want me to leave the house until Jan 20th - that is okay with me.

the TRILLION dollar stimulus plan cannot be practically put together in a week – well it's not a practical idea either so that whole thing has a nice cycle together doesn't it?

can pets smoke legal marijuana and walk at the same time in Ca – and I know in CA that case amy come up - the CA governor's office is the only one I know of to have animal issues as a possible topic  - however I don;t deal with NY, WA, or OR much these days - there may be others -

Gambling has downsides – both created jobs are not great – and then you create the MIT people who live to play poker- not a good class to create.

politicians don't like you if they lose and you were loyal to their winning opponent – um I woulldn't anything about that – fundraising for John Kerry and voting for George Bush and being honest about it in the beginning – in 2004 – I know nothing about that – politicians don't seek revenge- what – ya kidding me – nothing that happened to me looks like revenge? -  Are you kddin' me – it all looks normal.  Voted against carry – salray cut to a quarter of former amount -  alright alright. 

odd window popped up while filling in the clintonfounation.org contact form out - talked about a script running and asked me if I wanted to continue it or cancel - I picked cancel and everything was okay - just it was itneresting. 

patches was a famous pet of someone – is it the companion of socks the cat ?  Mother named the cat cabomba – so that is where my fluency with languages may come from – I just thought people gave pets unusal names versus object names. .  

Al Franken aas a Senator !!!!?????? - Somehow the quote “guilty as sin free as a bird” comes to mind. 

I noticed how the congressman answered the question of being Senator – if that is his worst crime – give him some coupons for those restaurantsthat are on your site as a punishment.  - kfyo -

burris has to run for reelection in 2 years.

with Chicago you would have to prove intent – and that will be difficult – but yes the system failed and it is “odd”

on the 5th and 14th ammendments - the doctors can force you to pay medical bills - like when you are under court order- they tell you to get medication and by court order you have to get it and in my case pay for it.  And yes that is property or money - i ahve to pay it isn;t in the court truling - the court didn't designate me to pay for medication - it designated doctor treatment - - the doctor then can prescribe whatever he wants - you are saying technically that may be a right violation - in addition they did take property - they - by their actions they did - the hospital and the city - the police did deprive me of property and never reimbursed me for it.   it's been 4 years - - end of 2005 - 3 years.  - the bus ticket that went bad because of forced hospitalization worth $300-400 dollars.  - time expired on it while in hospital.

I did write in the browser randy.senate.gov partway – and caught it – 8:39 eSt 1/5/09

We keep having references to the “fun” civil war ammendments-  the 14th ammendment is highly interesting – section 3 in particular – could he do that – he could – oh wow – and in a suit in a heartbeat that would flip – things – and it woudl bealmost cooler to announce the count and then invalidate them and elect the other person.  -

I note that the city of Chicago violated my 14th ammendment rights – when it “lost” myy motor voter application and I could not vote in the congressional 1998 election because of it – if I can prove intent and their might be intent – in addition section 1 of the 14th ammendment could be added to my case against Pittsburgh due to forfeited property and infringement of liberty – mother is going nuts downstairs – banging of door and motion – so yes the 14th applies to me in 2 different cases  - plus the federal implications – why am I having visions of like a thermo-nuclear explosion politically hitting the north – the equivalent of that – oh wow.   Not a real bomb – but just – I am getting – they are so far over the line – this still all seems like fiction at this point – it is beyond belief.  But yeah that ammendment applies to – we have 6 ammendments that were broken so far known - 1st , 4th 5th, 6th , and 8th , and now 14th – do I hear 7 ? - coughing badly. 

- I did have problems with icy and blurry windshields in cars in CT and IL – in IL I coudln't see in the sun from the streaks on my windshield at one point-  I remember that day – I was driving and I couldn't see out of the windshield -  that's not a good thing – no it's not – which is why I didn't very much – things would happen  - oh the car the AAA guy – who was russian or slavick by accent and who made getting the jump to move my car a huge problem nearly ran into him which would have been a problem – he was giving me bad instruction – constantly calling me an idiot and it seemed while he was standing behind the car in front of mine – parallel parked on those lovely Chicago streets by lake michcagan about 6000 North of downtown – Bryn Mawr- forehead resting on first two finger joints of right hand -  I thought he was telling me to put my foot on the gas to start the car and take foot off the emergency break and he kept calling me an idiot – this is the triple A person – you know when you can call – how stupid are you any way – and there was a witness family – I just was very careful and I didn't hit him but the family who owned the home was watching and were perfect witnesses – I was set up and “got lucky” - nothing happened – I still felt bad – I could have hurt him – didn;t want to – he put me in a situation by the way he acted with no visible witnesses to help me – where I almost injured him – it would have changed my life – there was no reason he had to stand right in front of my car – but he did – he set up an accident condition.  And yes he was slavick – I said Russian – maybe – could easily have been another slavik – But yes problems witth windshield wiper blades flying off the car – not working properly during heavy CT rainstorms and then during winter.  Frosted windshields in CT definitely a problem – rested forhead on first to finger joints again.  -  I called triple A when my car wouldn't start in Chicago and this is what happened – I never had “good luck” when people looked at my car – except for buying it and my first boss literally took me car shopping to a person he knew.  - not knowing how to use an automatic teller from drive through in a car. 

A colleague of mine in CMU – suction.com – and the indian in my class for two years – tried to get me to apply and go to Cooper Union and go there – in the year off – mother was against it – it sounded neat to me the way my two former classmates presented it -

I am an only child as well. 

craddock in TX did the redistricting – that wasn't the most equitable thing as I know of it. 

can we kick Austin out of Texas – um kinda a national problem right now kids is that too many people want to do that sort of stuff on a national scale.

A Middle Eastern Alamo?
I am not a good judge with Israel – I gave my theory – I do stick by it – the people of Gaza will remember this for a long time – and will feel – or I would feel less remorse at striking at Israel if I were one of them after an incident like this – isn't that a problem?   Have your really worked fully on methods to abduct or capture the people you deem responsible for the bombing without harming the rest of the population? - These pictures invite world outrage – Israel must know that – like almsot yhou are baiting the world to react – in honesty – like the Us(US) and colombia – when (you) do raids – don't you try to hit hard and fast minimize troop exposure to danger – get the targets quickly versus dragging out a campaign – I do not udnerstand any longer and have to again raise a flag-   What are you doing – besides levelling a city it looks like.  (unless this is the only way). 


from yahoo news
the mastermind of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, exhorted Palestinians to "crush" Israeli forces and to target Israeli civilians – that an interesting line -

and their rocket attacks concur with that – so the problem is that the leaders are hidden and the civillians are protecting them – would any of the civillians leave with the Israelis- into refugee camps while other business was going on in the city?   To clear the civillians not involved out of the way – or is that too hard to discern – I guess long term – if you are doing this it does make sense to be thorough -  i hope that it achieves the best outcome – again I think that if you did that to me – if you bombed me and forcibly took away the people i elected – maybe the election was done through terror – but that would encourage resentment that would not go away.   Do you have a second part after clearing out the people who may well just want to kill Israelis ?   Scratching back of head with right hand – you did say a permanent change in the situation.

60 Minutes – the wire for my keyboard is loose – I should have a still working spare and this one still works – yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer – it is “odd” how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV – itching – left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth – I was feeling aversion to writing this up – it is going now – maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney – said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time – my old license pla from Chicago – someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there – worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer – neat trick – the lights do blink – num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like – happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate – NY Prosecutor “deterring” drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder – this is a highly troubling story – and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems – the rammifications are not so simple – I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver – but as I cough up a little phlegm – here's the thing on this – I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude – bury him under the court – very vengeful – and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that – Someone is cackling somewhere – because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone – and that is the point – BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be – we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one – you can't win – be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink – he or she wasn'tr thinking – they lost control of the vehicle – and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case – a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident – the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown – it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent – to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case – you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women – but men may drink more – be expected to drink in more situations – I don;t know the stats – but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink – I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving – But the issues is – drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to – unless . . . .. intent can be determined – which in honesty even right now I bet it can – but not in a way that is admissable in court – but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing – the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink – it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk – that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along – he always made a big deal about that – I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish – when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me – it bristled me quite a bit – today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt – but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while – it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in – it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me – my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years – but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner – and I wouldn't have ordered there without him “meniktoning” it to me – and I didn't like – food was fine – it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk – I know with drugs – a professor bascially endorsed it by being there – and also smoking – it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving – second one – with brownies – funny brownies – I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor – we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it – again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases – with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs – and that is the big problem – oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs – and they probably could if they wanted to somehow – but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading – it has been done for quite a well – but we are talking about CMU – and trusting the wizards of CMU – DON'T – at least not at first – while brain patterns may be critical – I see a flaw in the study – but the premise can brain patterns be read – from my experience it certainly appears so – so the premise is not fully flawed – there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues – do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful – to me – I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003 – there was a MRI of my brain – well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005 – like in 2002 or 2003 – there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff – but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test – the computer images didn't come up – and the person – female – dark hair – did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial – the data was wasted – because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons – like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B – C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study – because my data was thrown out – yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that – MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes – though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking – school pyschologist at CCAC – in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution – we were talkign about medication – he used the phrase won't you try a little bit – and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me – on Dec 23 2005 – used the same phrase – won;t you try a little bit – when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no – in the emergency room – I did not say not – and I said maybe and maybe even yes – because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them – that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor – that female – reminded me of Jessica Lynch – from DAM – odd thing there.  Just a coincidence. 

But now maybe that I have shown how CMU helped me – perhaps I should help CMU – I am scared of these guys – Do they encourage the thought of window from the same picture-  because they said they generically know the brain pattern of window thought – what parts of the brain a person will use for window for any person – yet they haven't tried every stimulus or even a corpus of stimuli to indcue the thought of window – touching a window in a natural setting  may send a very different brain signal than the black and white image of window used – do different pictures of window have the same brain location – the word window – hearing it – hearing the sound of a double hung window being shut – they ahve those in Pittsburgh – mother got awning windows in this house oddly which the hurricane shutters on the top floor block from opening because of the low ceilings – 8 foot versus the builder wanted 9 foot – that does not seem to be accidental.  - but the good people at CMU – should not say they know a generic pattern of thought – their data is too preliminary – with just using the same picture.    Their time horizon is very optimistic for a machine that can fully read someone's mind – I can be wrong – but no one who is deceiving the machine – not a test where subject  can think about any object from any reference they have at least as a grounding should be there – the technology will not be 100% accurate from what they have shown – or that iws not proven and I worry about using that as court evidence for a while – I think it might be like cancer drugs.   We'll see a few of them come and go.    CMU is getting more corrupt – or corrupted by powerful money – it was while  I was there – odd to have CMU and Texas Tech together in 60 minutes.  - Rubbing back neck after touch by both eyes – index knuckle bottom to right cheekbone top and index finger to left, left eye edge and palm on neck all with right hand 

Texas Tech Football – fairy tale brings NFL money and influence – I don't want to talk about the Texas Tech football team – I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons - - oh my keyboard just blinked – ho oho – but I guess we are switching things a bit – Okay with that done let's talk D &D – The Zhentarim are presented i nthe way Dugneons and Dragons presents evil where for the most part the villain just wants to eventually get you onto a torture wrack and take al lyour magical items – but the Zhentarim in the Forgotten Realms setting do build a network of spies in smaller towns like Shadodale – home of Elminster the Seer – the most pwoerful I think mage in Faerun as Forgotten Realms is called-  Elminster moves to Faerun(Shadowdale) after many adventures he isn't born there – it isn't the size of Saerloon i nthe summer which if I remeber reaches over 200,000 but defintiely not quite 300,000 just yet – Saerloon is something like that in its prime seasons.  But we are talking about shadowdale and the zhentarim like having a network of spies but being in dungeons and dragons they're evil and pose as shady merchants, only occassionally do you see villain in D &D get real villain smarts and like totally infiltrate a good com munity posing as something they're not – polymorph others spells and many to later one's appearance do exist And definitely in Zhentil keep in one time period 2 Devils pose as a ruling couple of humans and no one knows their disguise within Zhentil Kepp for a long time.   - Coughing as I write that-  nearly lopped off my right big toe toenail with my left heel  pushing up on nail as I crossed my feet.   Gelatine from gummy bears does get your toenails to grow doesn't it Haven't had to clip them in months.  What did mother give me oh -  and she bought precisely two boxes of gelatine – jello – that is the other reason forsmall amounts of food – she controls dosages of nturients like medicine – rubbing left side of face with left hand as I write that and hir cheeck with palm and top of head left side in hair with fingers.  Wasn't an even rub.   Oh this is such a good horror movie.   Dropped this keyboard a little – common theme that – gget distracted for a minute – thinking about buying used versus buying new stuff at amazon and high school and looking up one of the people from elementary school yesterday online like I did antoher classmate – get into loop of thought – get out of it and rub left corner of motuh with left thubm – pass gas as I write that up  -touched thumbs as I identified ti as a loop of thought – but Zhentil keep is not like Sauron in the second age – where he comes as the bearer of gifts and good tidings and comes into the isle of Numenor as a fair person and only slowly corrupts them – this is before the war of the ring series by a thousand years or so – Second age – war of the ring ends the third age.  Mother is up 6:31 EST can hear her moving downstairs.  Biting into hand another pimple or small scab on hand – whitehead on my right thigh last night – they had mostly healed for a while – back to story -  there aren't many athletic contests within Dungeons and Dragons – jousting is mentioned in the C – it'sbeing blocked – before Imortals and Master  -but after Basic and Expert – I want to say Companion – that's not it – it is Companion – in the Companion series  they do talk of jousting and hosting a jjousting tournament as a noble lord – and rules on that.  Rubbed all around head as I began to suspcet that ti was companion - - nwo a yawn – they do nto want me to write this one – it is funny to watch this – and not so funny – but In Dungeons and Dragons at least in the rule book one doesn't getting into how to maximize revenue from a joust very much – of course in the model given – the lord or owner pays for the peasants to come to the joust and ti is  means to keep them happy – no lord invented the idea of makiing the peasants pay for their own holiday.  And yes agian no one thought of how to maximize revenue or attendance and interest in a jousting tourfnament in Dungoens and Dragons – it just isn't that important to other goals of the companion set such as the eventually goal of some charctgers to battle with the monsters in the world or other issues – jousting is far down the list much of the time.  We probably don't get into the idea of fairytale jousting tournaments and their imapct on peasant interest in jousting because of course dungeons and dragons si a fairy tale and the idea of the little prince being crowned king is quite easy to produce in dungeons and dragons and doesn't have to be faked and managed to happen – it happens all the time – in fact is boring and we moved on to crowinging the dark elf rebel as a noble above ground.  
That was one thing I wanted to get into – antoher – ya know when looking over Palladium and Rolemaster or middle earth both of which use the same gaming system – from Iron Crown Enterprises – one would wonder why the company is named after the Iron Crown of Morgoth – details details – but all three of those games have like 8 to ten attributes to describe a cahracters basic abilities unlike dungeons and dragons which has 6 – and therein actually USED to lie its beauty – it relatively simple game mechanics and then too many physicist and experts on hand to hand combat got together and now  apaprently in the 3rd edition there was a rules compendium put togehter just for the different – AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH – and it won appeal originally on its simplicity even if its depictions of combat weren't perfectly realistic – your fighter can take more damage than four warhorses – really ?  - but I digress – attributes I was focusing on attributes six attributes of dungeons and dragons – in particular things have shifted over the years – but I didn't want to get into the full history – instead – in Dungeons and Dragons when evaluating a person's mental abilities – the psionicist for example – intelligence over the ability to analyze data quickly is not just one stat – or being intelligent is not just one stat – it is actually 2 if not 3 stats – maybe even 4.   There is of course Intelligences which would be the stat that would be used in analyzing and calculating so many calcualtions per second or seeing a pattern and the raw recognition of a pattern or the many movements and getting to a pattern that would be under the attribute of intelligence – what used to be and still the traditional needed stat to be a wizard – of course in the third they introduced sorcerers who cast wizard spells but usede Charisma as the prime stat for their power and not intelligence or raw number crunching.  Charisma has changed over the years as it is hard to define – my definition currently may not fully match the games either – it used to sort of be good looks – it is definitely at first the characteristic a football coach would possess that drive and passion that can be used to sway the audience – but in current editions it has changed – and in 3rd edition I think – Charisma became more like Wisdom used to be and the drive the force of will – that became part of charisma's protfolio as an attribute – which is not there in the 1st edition – but it is there now and having a high Charisma is necessary to being a sorcerer.  Many sorcerers in the game tend to be loners it is noted here.  And the last definite mental trait of dungeons and dragons is wisdom used for clerics or priests – but wisdom is the ability stil lto see rammifications of actions and make good decisions based on the information one concludes – it is one thing to use Intelligence to analyze a situation quickly and rapidly and reach the right understanding of the plaiyng field – it is another thing to have the wisdom to take the right actions – many spell casters have higher mental attributes in all mental categories than physical – admittedly a high dexterity is useful for spellcasters to be able to duck out of the way when objects get thrown at them - - that did happen at nights as a freshman and sophomore at CMU when random people threw things at me as I ran on the track of Gesling stadium.  - just a remembrance – they did it fro mtheir dorm windows I think and I could not tell who was doing it – it made me move somewhere else to run.  Rubbed left cheekbone with right index finger.   - but to finish off – Being rated high mentally as a character in dungeons and dragons involves not only a high intelligence – but also wisdom and charisma  and one last score score also comes into play – Constitution – the ability to endure physical pain – and it was implied in older version that Constitution also was about enduring mental pain – I am thinking that should be Charisma to balance things out and make more sense.  Just checked it is in the 4th edition.  And the point kiind of was to push it out a bit – Some people can be very good in their analytic capabilities and lack wisdom to draw the right conclusions or the Charisma to challenge the status quo.  As I said earlier – I normally played a Wizard in the old game and now i would switch to Sorcerer. 

That about covers the morning – 32 dick Cheney started working in DC.  Hmmmm- he went to Yale – I am a Yale reject even if it was my home state.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


the caller said the smart person should be reading a newspaper and reading glasses – and by challenging the stereotype they may drag me into the helen keller comment – not unsurprising – and not inspired -  and she dropped want to scream at them – Cynthia.   - Crossing line-  is that what she said while i was writing? – ho ho ho – not nit-picking every little thing – sometimes we vary on what is little and what is big – don't we.   - she dropped Pelosi's name at the end.

probably guilty of using acronyms people don't understand.  - apparently no

you can't tell your son if he can vote or not – it's his choice. 

2nd Cia ad – 16:47 EST – kfyo. 

get out of fairytale land come back to reality – I talked about fiarytales in my critique of texas tech on 60 minutes  - 16::42 EST

there is a flyover – military helicopter – fog has come up – 16:19 EST – when I found the removed item – 1 of at least 2 in amazon – it's new and in stock – they have – like in walmart – they did a buy out in almart – they did a buyout of D&D and babylon 5 and anything I was looking at in amazon  - and now – liefted items out of my shopping cart that they missed – I either buy fro mtheir sellers – or not at all – this takes money.  To do this moeny and people – they are all guilty of price fixing and controlling a market. 

cia.gov ad on kfyo – 15:54 EST – something else – mom called out as I listed this. 

so a few things disappeared from my list on amazon.com  - ho ho  - they took out two things I liked at least – 15:49 EST – i can't even get what I find.. 

itching back of neck as I email governor richardson with right hand.  15:29 Est 1/5/09

someone shut off my internet connection 15:20 Est – I was going to say in time perhaps having someone who is deaf and blind as CIA chief may be possible – with different assistance – but not right now – and having someone who is potetnially ineffective as head of the CIA is “highly problematic” at this time.  - had to restart firefox web browser to regain internet – they may not like my new setup- figured out a new trick. 

yes I used to play tennis.. 

India the cat has died and in the (blank)  Ashwanttaman the elephant and not the hero gets killed.   I can't think of the stories name – Vedha - - Baghavad-Ghita – tiching left thigh with left hand as I come up with that.   ASHWANTAMAN GETS KILLEDI NTHE BATTLE IN THE bAGHAVAD -GITA -  again capitalization error – it's a trick by the “good” pandoba to bring down deetra- rashtra – so victory right now may not be too pure – understood. 

Why not Appoint Helen Keller as CIA Chief ?  - I realize the handicapped are discriminated against with that statement – but I think the point caries and no one who is deaf and blind should be CIA chief
Blind CIA Head Why Not
so we appointed a Cia chief who is ignorant of spying – going for the equal opportunity CIA – where you don't have to know how to catch the bad guys – GIVEN that obama has ties to known terrorists and he appointed a potentially espionage challenged person to head the CIA – oh this just gets better and better

diarrhea and a bloddy nose – is that what they tried to do to me – mother moved and is speaking.  14:54 EST – suggesting you're right. 

habitat building shoddy houses? - didn't hear about that. 

carter's foreign advisory – from Russia- he won a nobel too didn't he? - like I remember cringing at something he said on the newshour – I didn;t know he advised carter – DURING THE COLD WAR – Carter had someone from the USSR as a foreign polciy advisor - ??? - he may be qualified – that is a wow thing – like I remember a little of the Reagan era – I can;t imagine what is was like in Carter's time – The USSR was the enemy -

went to hannity.com – meant to go to hutchison.senate.gov – and I capitlized most of this line by accident and retyped it – 1/5/09 14:38 Est. 

Selling Cold medicines during winter does make some sense - but we are hainvg quite a few coughing people or sick people by sound in ocmmercials on kfyo - take your temperature-  cough syrup - cough medication - staying awake or fresh breath with smart mouth moutwash -  SNL is now making the commercials on kfyo it would seem - And there is health concern after health concern on kfyo.  14:04 EST 1/5/09

ethics classes in chicago - sensitivity trainingwhen dealing with polar bears and pets in animal shelters
the ethics in Chicago or actually IL may come ocmplete with cliff notes so you don't have to actually learn everything about ethics.

Gaza – you have Justified the Death of Your Children
After looking at Al-Jazeera – where Hamas is saying the justficiation of the deaths of Israeli children is validated -Israel did pick this time to “get peace for its citizens” - - I will be itnerested to see how the “fundamental  situation” changes because of current actions – I wouldthink things will just repeat themselves unless Israel is extremely clever – and I am not usre that will happen – once Hamas is cleared out -won'tit just came back – I already commented that the timing of this as the US government changes – is highyl suspicious – I now udnerstnad 500 people is not even 1% of 400,000 – so someone is at least being somewhat careful – with the atttackers and the situations Israel has – developig – non-lethal means of arresting perpetrators and  capturing them – our governemtn did not look at that carefully – and should have – Israel has much more incentive – yes a teenage Palestinian can kill an Israeli soldier with whatever – do you still want to be the one to explain to his family why their son was killed by grown soldiers? -  So if you could keep them alive and incapacitate them to sort things out – less resentment would be created – I watched as it looked like our military vetoed that idea in favor of lethal technology which of course was only so effective in somalia and in other close combat places where you have to deal with the families of the people you just murdered – there is a time when death is needed – but how much and when are at question and our military basically said – we prefer to kill than th use non-lethal technology it appeared – or I haven't heard a good ocunterargument as to why non-lethal technology has not been developed in 20-30 years?  That is what could be better and I would bet our military isn't the only one who underneath may prefer dead enemies to incapacitated ones.  - I will watch – it's not mine to act – It is Israel's call. 

Rush we've entered the Obama years – your radio show is now edited by Michelle Obama and Bill Ayers.   And you are allowed to say one syllable per hour.

Yes they Can  . . . . . threaten with Caillous

picked at random from first search list-  but not on the initial channel that I used for the other two - “Caillous” goes apple picking – I stayed away from the police officer and the fireman – which obvious bad chocies – this I thought was safe -
I have to go to the bathroom and am fighting that - 
in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy. 
How would that whole segment apply to me – I am that big apple they are trying to pick – pick nbefore it matures and hits the ground and gets bugs in it – the CIA – might be the bugs - - deer – i saw deer many deer in Pittsburgh – big deer hunting place – apples are a favorite treat of deer – deer like to eat apples – then they go into the different way once apples are picked and stopped from growing they can be used for many things – and caillous goes – I like mine all alone – kind of quick and dirty is how we're going to get you  - and the cleaning the garden in the spring reference – Pittsburgh – celaned me out of the city -and at the bar on Atwood Street – nto sure if it was the spring – but could have been  spring of 2005 or summer 2005 – a guy with the clean up Pittsburgh shirt on came by me out of the bar on atwood – and shirts were used for a lot messges.  Game Over  and dead men tell no tales – currently I see no one so I can't see a shirt.  Yes this is the last clip I saw – they can threaten me with caillou and caillou is negative-  the over clean aspect – the happy friendly playground – lady ellaine fairchild has been banished- even Mr Rogers had more evil in his show than this does.  Everyuone is happy and gets along.  From Canada.   I don;t Garfield – and I know he is corrupt too – but garfield had on the budedyt bears – who got along perfectly and they mocked on Garfield-  but he became an environmentalist and not a friend and i know that.  But that one aspect was so bad – The buddy bears looked fake for always getting along.  
Mother introduced me to Garfield. 
So in an instant search this is what I found – first record I didn't try much – they only had 30 seconds
“Garfield and Friends episode Return of the Buddy Bears”
- cleaning the house by getting rid of all the food – stiffing the buddy bears pay – the house is messy from Garfield - - no linking at all to me-  yes     EVERY SINGLE VIDEO i GET ON MY OWN IN YOUTUBE CAN BE MADE HOSTILE – AND WHAT THEY DID A MASSIVE BUYOUT ON ALL d & d AND RELATED STUFF ON AMAZON – BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCTS I WANT ARE OUT OF STOCK – though it is odd the shipping estimates on what i did order got revised upward.  From the 9th and the 14th to the 20th ordered couple days ago.    None of the items came.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

there are I think more PA house members than TX – but TX has a greater population – this is what happened in PA House too – where a Democrat became speaker for the first time when the Republicans  led by 1 vote in the house in 2006.   The same thing happened – it suggests that while there is a strong majority -the fringe of the party has concerns that are not brought up.   What would anyone say to rotating the speaker – like giving the minority speaker control fo the floor for so much time – keep the votes as they are – but would it be farer to rotate and give the minority a minority of time as speaker – not give full one party rule in the house.  Allow the minority to bring up some legislation?  -

I think the host of a certain show in tX – controlling the speakership without a majority to pass liberal legislation – in addition there still is a governor and another chamber - - it may be good for texas to have laternate legislation come up through the House – please don't like do a conservative version of the Obama media. 

the caller said the smart person should be reading a newspaper and reading glasses – and by challenging the stereotype they may drag me into the helen keller comment – not unsurprising – and not inspired -  and she dropped want to scream at them – Cynthia.   - Crossing line-  is that what she said while i was writing? – ho ho ho – not nit-picking every little thing – sometimes we vary on what is little and what is big – don't we.   - she dropped Pelosi's name at the end.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


NARAl is a DAMclient – 100% approval I would fear – if from them – but they may not like him and know that is a way to get him out of office in Texas.   Gambling though – not in favor of that – Environmentalism – mixed – but afraid of most people who CLAIM to be environmentalists – so the TX speaker  candidate – may nto get my vote – but nor may craddock – there should be an honest person somewhere – he oculd be honest – no real info on him..   I'd have to dig and my plate is kind fo full.   Welfare expansion – it depends – but no in general – I have shuddered at that enough.   - it is incorrect more than likely to call him Herr Strauss – German noble title – still he may balance TX more than hurt – he needs the Governor and the Senate.   - Ah the irritable bowels syndrome commercial – the CIA commercial airs mroe than it does now – that is reversed.  Rubbing by left mouth corner with left thumb. 


I was looking at the Aspect book of Air fro mwhite wolf with the spells in it – the system is slightly like the one I am trying to develop – asnd white wolf just appeared-  BUT it has significant differences – it appears less refined – and I can site where than the system I am coming up with – I of course have not fully PUBLSIHED my system for people to know about – and you have been trying to demonstrate to me like in radio calls – that everything i do is already thought of – that one time on the allen hunt show when he wanted to talk with Atheists – or non-church goers – but you are lying – or not being fully truthful – there is refinement in what I rpoposed that is not in anything I've seen – it is incremental – but some of it is still novel – and it is not vain to try to innovate – it bothers me greatly – you want nothing left of me – and my side still keeps me busy so I can't do too much - “we're in a national crisis” - OH PLEASE YES – BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GAME PLAN AND BE HONEST – you kind of want a leash on me – andthe computer slowed the cursor slowed with the text – so someone in copying the text or something as I type – and to completel the thought – you don;t really a right to leash me – not by law- Tesla – also was not – the law bent for him – against him in odd ways to affect a better national  security – it's not fun having your ability to do whatever you want taken away – I am not allwoedto finish or fully write out – I seem to get distracted  before I finish anything strongly – the other side seems to lakc the pwoerto do that over time – only one side can like push on you for months to not do something and follow up with -please don't fight us – but it is frustrating -  CIA ad 18:35 EST 1/5/09 – but I can and found several innovation – most a needed innovation in gaining experoence – can I flesh that idea out?   - it is too soon to call it done – but – you do spin me a little to prevent me from running myself- not happy about that.  - and it is disconcerted to see that people appear to know my paper notes before I even get them typed up they are being challenged – I bet that is never suppsoed to happen – and I am passed wind like a wild goose. 


there are I think more PA house members than TX – but TX has a greater population – this is what happened in PA House too – where a Democrat became speaker for the first time when the Republicans  led by 1 vote in the house in 2006.   The same thing happened – it suggests that while there is a strong majority -the fringe of the party has concerns that are not brought up.   What would anyone say to rotating the speaker – like giving the minority speaker control fo the floor for so much time – keep the votes as they are – but would it be farer to rotate and give the minority a minority of time as speaker – not give full one party rule in the house.  Allow the minority to bring up some legislation?  -

I think the host of a certain show in tX – controlling the speakership without a majority to pass liberal legislation – in addition there still is a governor and another chamber - - it may be good for texas to have laternate legislation come up through the House – please don't like do a conservative version of the Obama media. 

the caller said the smart person should be reading a newspaper and reading glasses – and by challenging the stereotype they may drag me into the helen keller comment – not unsurprising – and not inspired -  and she dropped want to scream at them – Cynthia.   - Crossing line-  is that what she said while i was writing? – ho ho ho – not nit-picking every little thing – sometimes we vary on what is little and what is big – don't we.   - she dropped Pelosi's name at the end.

probably guilty of using acronyms people don't understand.  - apparently no

you can't tell your son if he can vote or not – it's his choice. 

2nd Cia ad – 16:47 EST – kfyo. 

get out of fairytale land come back to reality – I talked about fiarytales in my critique of texas tech on 60 minutes  - 16::42 EST

there is a flyover – military helicopter – fog has come up – 16:19 EST – when I found the removed item – 1 of at least 2 in amazon – it's new and in stock – they have – like in walmart – they did a buy out in almart – they did a buyout of D&D and babylon 5 and anything I was looking at in amazon  - and now – liefted items out of my shopping cart that they missed – I either buy fro mtheir sellers – or not at all – this takes money.  To do this moeny and people – they are all guilty of price fixing and controlling a market. 

cia.gov ad on kfyo – 15:54 EST – something else – mom called out as I listed this. 

so a few things disappeared from my list on amazon.com  - ho ho  - they took out two things I liked at least – 15:49 EST – i can't even get what I find. 

itching back of neck as I email governor richardson with right hand.  15:29 Est 1/5/09

someone shut off my internet connection 15:20 Est – I was going to say in time perhaps having someone who is deaf and blind as CIA chief may be possible – with different assistance – but not right now – and having someone who is potetnially ineffective as head of the CIA is “highly problematic” at this time.  - had to restart firefox web browser to regain internet – they may not like my new setup- figured out a new trick. 

yes I used to play tennis. 

India the cat has died and in the (blank)  Ashwanttaman the elephant and not the hero gets killed.   I can't think of the stories name – Vedha - - Baghavad-Ghita – tiching left thigh with left hand as I come up with that.   ASHWANTAMAN GETS KILLEDI NTHE BATTLE IN THE bAGHAVAD -GITA -  again capitalization error – it's a trick by the “good” pandoba to bring down deetra- rashtra – so victory right now may not be too pure – understood.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

and mccain.senate.gov is slow-  the events on it are slow - that same error they do - usually on reid's site.  - uggghhh 00:06 EST 1/6/09

could not get the http tags out of my email address on the ak gov website – didn't see any. 

23:58 ESt - could not get mccain.senate.gov up - first try though - will try again - but it's that kind of error - slow my connection and contacting sites down error - and events on screen it has happened before several times - and it's midnight east coast - no one is awake to block it.  1/5/09

every event - typing in a web address on thebrowser is slowed-  it is that error again - uggghhhh 23:52 EST

computer getting very slow on internet as I bring up yahoo mail to mail down from here – I mean I get the idea – Obama won't put leftists in the cabinet as first policy – but whomever is hacking my computer- once Bus(h) hand(and) cheney are gone – there will be no one left who will prevent from doing anything they want to me – and like someone will come in my neighborhood in broad daylight and jsut say if anyone wants to complain – we have the presidnet's backing – it won'tbe that blatant – that is what will happen.  Yippee !!  - having internet issues though 30 seconds for a page load- and it lessened a bit when I stopped trying to use yahoo and made a few clicks indicating i was going somewhere else. 

Question – Nixon had his issues – ego and whatever else – did he believe in Saul Alinsky? - like with the equivalent – there was a limit – Nixon could have imprisoned Paul McCartney he did not go that far – he was in power – there is a difference even between Nixon and someone else – i see a difference – a troubling one – one last chilling thought – for tonight -

Iwill address the Arab overtreatment issue brought up tonight – tomorrow – where Arabs were treated better than jews were through history.   Should the British reconquer Brittany isn't it ?

Dave Ramsey – I “slipped” for 13 minutes.  You directly compared a house payment and rent – I must admit I was not listening intensely and perhaps something – I did not hear though – the other issue – that if something breaks in the house – taxes – houses have additional payments BESIDES the regular loan and insurance – that I hope were included together – THAT is why rent can win – and we didn't actually look into what could be rented for what-  I ahve to admit in my current neighborhood-  you might need $1000 a month for $1000 sq ft – in Pittsburgh  $800 a month would get you a duplex or row house with 3 bedrooms it appeared – those figures are older – I do know that in cases i know of – they don;t rise very quickly -like perhaps 10% or 15 % at best fro mthe time they were taken – credit cards are not as big as problem – although they are a problme – but controlling car issues and expenses and house issues and expenses – those are major expenses- the situation was set up – with 3 kids and a paper route – that prevents smaller living conditions and it's car itensive job- many people don't have that – and again – houses have varying costs – apartments do not – that can be  a huge advantage.   Though apartments depend on the ethics of your landlord – houses of course depend on the ethics of the town government and your neighbors – both cases other people can be problematic if they want to be. 

Caller's bating Mark Levin to take strong pro-jewish stance – as I listen to him refer to Al Frenken as an idiot-  I don't know if Al Franken is fully an idiot – my fur will definitely fall out over him being confirmed as a Senator after that “election” - I think wisdom is thequality that does not seem to translate. 

   “rapid lunatics violently attacking people “ “everybody is repeating what they hear” - Rachel 21:39 EST 1/5/09

Senator Biden Holding his seat – yes Mark Levin it is interesting he is doing that – I do not think the reason you gave in public that he is holding it for his son is the correct one- for one – he can't hold it long enough – or much longer.   So it might be somethging else.  Boy this is gonna be interesting. 

are we going to hear about the evils of e-waste for like the next year now – please – it is clear that other coutnries will accept it as a profit base to get currency – that is not a perfect scenario – it is not necessarily in world interest to block that – and the idea that it is the largest problem – no – not really – I'm a little more concerned – with stolen election =- lossed liberty and the expectation of waste to fund several industries – and a person said on radio the other day the the NEA was more dangerous than organized – the Nea did try to provide a service – education – so did organized crime – in some cases – wanted drugs and prostitution – organized crime does deliver its services – the Nea tries to only deliver a certain amount of service – the Nea has blocked and destroyed potentially the careers of many people – by several policies – I will include my won experiences where it decided to force me into the mental health system – and it does that to others in addition to trying not to allow the person to come into existance that would not fit into the system in the first place – it may have influence in educational television and radio – toning down the quality – the University system is not user friendly and not really best solution for business – and efforts at school are fought – I have been convinced that tenyear isn't terrible – there were considerable efforts to destroy non-NEA schools when tried by other companies-  it is a harsh thing to say that – my governor is a teacher – to blatantly say to the Nea who feels they are entrusted with children – you are worse than organzied crime-  looking at like 50 years and what is happened – and various issues – they have done significant damage and I am not fully aware of their - “extracircular” activities.    The urban schools – has interesting issues – I have only been in a few of them – it is very different from a rural school.   They don't use guns, risperdal is close to that – just no bullets.   Hospitals and schools in US have mixed up their priorities and confuse money and their supposed function – I don't feel like condmening them -  BUT – I will say – with me they have acted like the mob and definitely have functioned like a criminal unit – I cannot find too much that I can defend for the NEA – when i look at the University system – the elementary school system and I cringe at it all – I would seriously look at home school for my children – if I had them.   People want an income and are not satisfied with their jobs – and that creates a problem – And are afraid of haivng to look into something else.. 

http://randy.house.gov/- 20:53 EST site is down – um I hope that is desired – 1/5/09

- the radio got turned off while I was in the bathroom – in such a way that I have to kill the internet browser to get back the sound – it is a standard method to track me and I will try to fool it – 19:06 – passed gas while writing -

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

1/6/09 -8:35 EST – computer is slow on internet – like last night – despite measure to alter – a little slow to get to new sites . 

star registry -commercial kfyo – one of the guys when I was in temporary labor for 2 days – the first day the guy who was my boss – had a star registry thing in his car.  - but he and the other one -gave the pittsburgh story of being hand to mouth and sick and have to keep going – and I now realize that was a line – it was Pittsburgh's way of pushing me away from what i was doing which would have potentially  hurt their plans.  Even a small amount of income – would have been hard for them to control so they gave me the worst jobs to discourage me from taking more -and that was planned – like spanish – the argentinian non-credit spanish teacher – they moved to break my connection with her-  they did the same with temporary labor so they could control me better. 

--
Mark Levin – I should hear the whole show – of 1/5/09 still missing a few minutes in the middle but two main threads of thought where a gauntlet goes down -

I do feel a bit – I used the anology of a trapper keeper or there was something similar from meade where a gorilla was i9n the commercial and he stomped and and tried to tear it up and then after all that used it – I fell kind of like – oh a little tickle in throat – we are in the morning – th's addressed- it got me to think about carrying the packages that came yesterday up the stairs in my right arm – nd the joints were oddly in pain – we do keep down the meat I have – it's never red meat – it's white or turkey and it is – Ican only have os much of it – she only puts a portion out never serves the whole much of the time and she is doing sauces – tomato sauce doesn't make it that often – and I know they are trying to get me sick – we couldn't let me had all the vitamins – like we didn't let me buy that a while back – like the books at amazon where they just go out of stock if you don't want me to buy them – I tried to buy something really high in nutrients – and you wouldn't let me get it – geting onto other thoughts and  getting farther away from topic – could discuss classical music – or issues with dinner-  I will note that the classical CD from walmart arrived yesterday – it is scratchy – skips quite a bit – and something seems wrong with it on day 1 – it does play currently – I am not overly fond of the selections – the one that i thought i would like for sure which was the reason I got the Cd – that dirge is normally done in heavy organ music and this CD has a much lighter feel to a dirge which highly inappropriate-  much weaker – someone got rid anytthing in walmart for $1.88 that would appeal to me I have a feeling – because I was struggling and this was a compromise – I knewthat getting it – but even this – the key part is messed up – a dirge that is played more like a lullaby – someone manipulated so that I would get very little I wanted to hear at home.   - I had criticism – with the scary sounds- actually mother gave it to me – I guess I'll write fast – it got – I may have thrown it out – something happened to it – but I had a tape of scary soudns where the sounds did a very good job of painting a picture of a story – it took you very well from outside a haunted by sound to inside to different scenes in the haunted house and there was organ music in the house that got louder and louder and at the end of the tape you were in the room with the organ music and the house exploded – witches cackling and the regular-  but all around that theme – I ahve been looking for something ever since 2004 – and I have not found it – the organization of the sounds and the way you can imagine the various scenes and there is a point to the sounds placed that makes the tape – classical music suffers from this – repeating patterns – there is no strong story many times – not every time – but many times – there's only a melody that doesn't repeat for a minute – versus a constantly changing melody throughout the song- modern songs – may nto change melody throughout – but the words change and thus it is always new in some part – classicla doesn;t have words – unless you include opera.   Carmina Burana – does change throughout.   The moonlight sonata changes a lot as well and builds well – at least through a movement which is enough – it doesn't really build movement to movement.  - done with music – I am worried how my “doctor” will affect my long term health with the nutrition and knowing she is trying to control what I eat – and what nutrients get in my body.   I sort of keep a can of the pizza sauce – tomatoes that I know tastess pretty good by me as a ward against mother dearest – that if she fights hard this way – I have one thing left- touching forehead to first two right index figner joints- 
I realize that the constant questions are not necessarily meant for discussion they are meant to make me feel like a beat up suitcase and the constant presure is kept up by manyt people not to be honest – but just to win through wearing me down – it does take away energy from other things – and I won't hide that that bothers me – that being the punching bag to prevent the mob from getting to castle freankenstien and killing the scientist and creation is not what I wanted.  Mother might be up – or the friendly devils are starting their morning bombing practice  - fur elise is growing on me – as their is some complexity – still was looking for an encore to the moonlight Sonata #3 – and that is not here – I guess mother was and I spoke to her early this morning so what will happen to me innards now that she has that-  I usualy try not to speak to her till dinner time – somehow I have less issues in my body that way-  I left one thing above – I wonder if people could n't make soundscapes-  of mvoing through a farm – a factory – an office – the day at work – a thunderstom- a montage I guess of sound – but one to illustrate an experience – to educate through the sounds heard what a life is like- computer science might even be interesting.  - a thought – mother did just speak with me 6:13 EST – I took a little vitamin C for my sore throat and until mother spoke with me – I bet I wans't gettingsick today – now she will work on it all day. 

Not getting on to the important things – the two points presented for argument – stopping to put a blanket on as I get to them and notice my side is cold so I am shifting – before I need to go to the bahtroom which will come let me try to write.

The first point – is that if you take away traditional worship – some seem to have concluded that inevitably leads to failure – Mark Levin was arguing that both fascism and socialism rejected God and that others feel that is what happens when you reject God – I will leave out most physical signs while typing – the toes -  the are doing distractions so i ahve to fight that – but that is the basic argument if you leave out God you get a failed state – some people are not fully honest that they like people to fear God and leave that myth of god because they are easier to manipulate and won't seek fully to understand and deduce out what is going on behidn the scenes if it is just God and God just can do things.   Certain people like to use that to exploit people, and they use that to control people through church – neither a worthy objective.  But both yes Karl Marx is ocrrect perhaps in saying that in truth religion is an opiate of the masses – to a large degree – that blind faith without any understand – I don't support that – blind with understanding is something that I support, but Marx is correct that religion can be an opiate to the masses and definitely I don't like the way the other side likes people so fully deluded that they make illogical choices which the other side likes because it keeps the 2 tiers of society as they are – which is the intention.  - got off thinking of changing the music – 6:27 – but that socialism will lead to destruction – how much different is libertarianism from socialism – getting off shouldn't bring uop that thought – but there is nothing wrong – in ideal – with trying to provide needed resources to people and correcting the abuses of capitalism – there is nothing in that ideal- and yes – that gets me on a tact into thoughts I don;t want to do right now – I was going to say socialism may be like the light bulb – where the system isn't right and something else needs to be looked at – not state run – I have to think on it-  the first version of our constitution failed too though – as a reminder – the Us was not an automatic success story – and the issues in the US system are there and saying it can't get any better than this – that is bunk -  but I wanted to note – to toally blow up this argument – that Sadam Hussein had essentially a Fascist state and instead of running from religion  HE EMBRACED RELIGION – religion works well and that need to go to church can be used well in a fascist state if the state runs the church or controls it.  The South used the church with slaves to teach obedience ortried to use it that way..  It was a source of freedom because the wrong bible passages got used – but the Southerners tried to correct for that and essentially Hitler was Smarter and Hussein was smarter – they never read the wrong bible passages – just kept in the people's ears what they wanted to hear- yes we can,  yes we can – But i can definitely say that religious fascism works well – but that was Isalm Christianity could never do that – oh boy – what about the forming of the Protestant religions in Europe during the reformation or enlightenment – 1800s isn't it or 1700's actually Napolean's era.   Euroep has a lot of history – we're getting to Israel – that's next question.   Catholicism had a brush or two of being totalitarian and being corrupt in its past.  And yes kids – perhaps you should ask the mormons whether the other protestant religions are not capable of making a totalitarian state – isn't there a reason the mormons went to Utah. 

Okay second part ofthe first qeustion socialism – well that didn't work – next – but what can we learn? - that if turn off belief blindly and there is no replacement that that does not work  -I am not proposing that and I am not proposing socialism the way it was – I want to hold on my proposal – not hold back- I haven't fully formed it – I like and see the need for a market or the use for one – but clearly – i feel that social customs are changing because of education and that – they are trying to make me forget – that there it is – that the modern systems are too good at fooling the market – that is being so fully demonstrated right now it isn't funny – you're not supposed to be able to do censorship via good pricing  in capitalism – unless there is a sincere need – but you're not supposed to be able to take an idea off a capitlist market – and with the dungeons and dragons price fixing thing – you are trying to – yo uare trying to now stifle in role-playing with me-  is this what you did to art and do to music -  YOU ARE BY YOUR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THAT CAPITALISM IS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOR  - the market was there to equalize and to allow exchange of products – it was not there to be a vehicle by which to deny products – and while it is clear others are fighting back – you can effectively deny me a book or two – and put them way out of my price range – and deny me their contents in my studies – which means you can do it with anything and you are trying to set up that system – where price controls who gets access to what knowledge.   NO – this shows that the US version of capitalism needs modification more than anything else – this display that has been put on.    I do not have an example of God in socialism – but it could be – clearly in Ravenloft – they propose an example of socialism with religion – Zakata – I would have to look – there is a cleric that rules one of the terror domains – and you redistribute crops – and you starve a family member as part of the religion – it is a horror thing – but the proposal could be feasible as socialism system with religion – noyt the starvation though humans do a lot of crazy thngs in real life – but the use of God to encourage socialism – Jesus and the early Catholics there is that passage – they weren't super capitalists - - let me find the ravenloft reference -  in Ravenloft the example is G'Henna is the land the lord of it is Yagno Petrovna – it's a myth but a clear example of how a scoialist systrem could work with the church as a center – and there are real examples – the puritans did socialism – the US puritans – I was going to look at Buddhism and India where Brahins are above princes in the social hierarchy – but no the puritans suffice – the purtians did a socialist system based on religion – we had socialism in the US – but it didn;t work – AH but that doesn't matter to the proof – socialsim isn;t perfect in Europe either-  the question was not whether socialism worked – but whether not beloieving in God lead to socialism – I have given counterexamples where believing in God not only may not protect you from socialism or fascism  - BUT instead religion is an excellent enhancer of both socialism and fascims and  KEEPING PEOPLE BELEIVING THINGS THAT ARE NOT LOGICAL AND KEEPING THEM IN A STATE WHERE THEY DO NOT QUESTION I BELIEVE IS MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOCIALIST OR FASCIST STATE -  the land of strawberry short cake or caillhou – everything is perfect.  There is no evil. 

Oh boy and that is question one – and now question – poor jews – I kind of want this one to be quick so – I will address directly 

Muslims are Islamo-Nazis who want to kill everyone including all other nations – I do nto think this ids what they want – I don't bin Laden and Hamas are the same person or belief system – same with Iran – I do not know there belief system  - in general Arab culture feels that Madonna and encouragement of homosexality – encouragement of pronography of drugs of sex of rich and poor through lending money – Isalm teaches and feels that this situations which arise in the west are evil from what I udnerstand  it views the freedom of women as perhaps a reason for the coming immorality that is sees i nthe west -  IF I HAVE IT RIGHT – IT'S ARGUMENTS ARE NOT SO DISSIMILAR FRO MCONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS SECTS IN THE US  - Isalm wants to wipe out what it sees as evil – We do not seem to want to take a critical look at what our style of capitlaism has encouraged in our culture and not look at that some things we do are nto so defensible – Isalm is saying we have a better solution – our way is better – that may not be true – but they have an objection to our culture and instead of answering it – wesay they are terrorists for not wanting to be caught up in our culture and we are ignorant of the idea that our culture affects them and their children – in honesty the Islamic fundamentalist argument against the US – is the much different than the Christian fundamentalist argument against me – or Pittsburgh's argument against me – though I am trying to address yo+ur concerns – you instead send an army to suppress the muslims – there was some good intent – the US military -many of its memeber do not love te muslims – or even toelrate them with equality – and definitely to the military the thought eradicate the threat to the US – versus needing to win a discussion – most of the US will not have that discussion with Islam which is what will end the war – you have to separate the true terrorists from the people who believe we are evil through hopefully ignorance -  THOUGH I AM STARTING TO WONDER ON THAT POINT -  you are not showing the best side of our tolerant democracy with me – there is some terror for terror's sake – bin Laden can hoenstly claim – you didn't listen to anything else and the peaceful people weren't getting through to you – it took blowing up the world center to get your attention in any menaingful way to that we have concerns you are wrong nad you are affecting our children – and looking into my homeland -  THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT A CORRUPT CULTURE WHICH ALLWOS THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY AREN'T THERE SOME OF YOU BILLIONAIRES WHO MADE MONEY OFF THE HOUSING CRISIS – and I forgot the next thought – but something like – we are having objections from our society to look into cleaning it up and addressing some of the issues – I had a stronger point – but it was along those lines – and we do need to address apaprently fairly large corruption – many US people who opted for a corrupt system as long as they get a good job.  Needed to clean nose all the sudden – but there are oddly issues – ah – I was going to say above – the issues that have turned up have proved Bin Ladin partially right that there is corruption and there are problems in western culture – the yes we can  . . . . destroy all your liberty movement is not proving Bin Laden wrong.  I knwo I should take a southern attitude and just disagree without being disagreeable and not discuss it like has been done for several decades which has led to this wondrous position we are currently in .  It is going to be cool turning the internet connection  back on  and you have to read al lthis – contemplating the music – you can have complexity in a softer way in music –this morning it works – but normally I want it a little faster – more complicated – got into a loop – mental loop – rubbed back of head iwht right hand as I realizedthat.  7:20 EST

Now the poor Jews part from Mark Levin
Arabs keep all their land – we never get our land-  I have to check census – there are a lot more arabs than jews – for recorded history they have always been in that region after Mohammed and those events took place -  THAT IS HOW THINGS WOUND UP -  they were occupied too – they did not keep Austria which is where the Ottoman empire used to extend to.  - it might be interesting to look up why constantinople fell and became Istanbul – like the other Christians acted kind of like people are acting now and allowed a tragedy to occur.  Rome and Italy and Russia were disinterested fro what I remember of history and would not aid Constantinople in staying alive.  - mother asked if she could takethe package to the post office for me – demonstrating myh inability to do basic things without assistance.   Ant got in a loop and rubbed top of head as I got out of it.  In History the jews have not been in Israel before 1950 ish for many hundreds of years I beleive – Israel was a state that ceased to exist – we ahve a bibilical claim – or a claim in the torah to ti – we were there – like should Ares and Mars and Jove be the principle religion of Israel – it is history – it wasn't a current claim in 1950 – in addition owning land was invented in the UK in 1700s wasn't it – the jews were in Israel in the past – and come back to Israel – saying it had to be theirs by a biblical claim on the land – we don't really want to start doing that – because like the Aztecs would demand mexico – the Pequots would demand CT – other indian US tribes would demand a lot – Europe would be a mess again – should the British reconquer Britanny isn't it inf France – the stuff the 100 years war was about?  - The jewish claim to Israel in 1940 or whatever was not any stronger than that-  Arabs havne't been fully better treated – they lost different wars and had a different history with their land than the jews and the jews chose not to have a coutnry elsewhere – that was a choice – it had to be Israel – uggghh0-  that is not what the plymouth rock pilgrims chose.   And yes I do not recognize the torah nor the bible nor the Qu'ran – there is a new spelling – as legal documents or unchangeable rationales – jews don't recognize mecca as sacred – but Islam says it is so – Is Rome not holy? - BUT – with a country you do ask for international recognition and that is not done in a religious text – but that is the claim of Israel – or how it started -   Mark mentioned 500,000 jews thrown off land – by Arabs – I don;t knwo the time period on that – And 500,000 comapared to what – how many were in Palestine? - there are 400,000 in Gaza in addition to the disruption to egypt – Iraq – again I identified the middle east as one of two big poweder kegs on the world surface – for the US – China and then the middle east -  INDIA AND PAKISTAN WITH LIKE 1 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ARE LESS OF A PROBLEM I THINK – CONSUME LESS TIME AT THE STATE DEPEARTMENT THAN ISRAEL  - you decided to uproot people from the land they were currently living on and force them into a state where you were dominat – and did so on a biblical claim – claim of a religious – the pope of the past tried with the crusades – it didn't work out so hot.  Weren't the arabs there in 1000 AD ? - like it was the Christians against the Arabs.  The arab people and religion made different choices – where they made good ones they made out -  where they didn't things happened – perhaps certain ideas in Judaism have not led to the most successful society and that is the cause of past troubles -

The world hates us – I really didn't shout this – but there is a sense – I definitely have gotten this in spades – there is this -  NONE OF YOU MATTER THIS IS VAT OUR HOLY TEXT SAYS WE SHOULD DO AND WE WILL DO IT – AND NONE OF YOUR BELIEFS OR YOUR VALUES MATTER – WE WILL PRETEND TO LISTEN NICELY AND THEN DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY  - WE ARE THE CHOSEN OF GOD – YOU ARE NOT  -  that doesn't go over too well with the neighbors – that like in the end their beliefs are crap and you have no intenion of respecting any of them – it does come out – I realize these days not every jew feels the way of the above statement – but it is there – I had a jewish boss tell me he was not jewish enough because a baptisement in Israel is worth more than one done in the US – that is scary to me as a concept.  And it is not based on a rational belief – religious beliefs are not always rational – Shiite muslims – and the suffering for their cleric who died in that ceremony where they cut their scalps – the jews just believe their religious text – words a jew wrote down for eternity entitle them to a piece of land in Asia I guess technically – ya know in several million years it will all be lava ? - what then?    Will the jews occupy Israel when it is molten rock or as it falls into the earth ? - it happens in time – rubbed face with left hand like 5 lines up .  Scratching privates – nearly got into a loop -  

it is hard in this century to deal with customs based in relgiion – sacred burial rights on ski slopes in CO – no I am not a full fan and some time in the future – those lands may be less sacred – it is not rational – for now – we don't need them – would any of the indian tribes ever explore rejoining the  US?   Canada and the US may join before that happens.  I will not force that – just saying it is not the jews who are the only who do odd things because of religion – okay okay – you didn;t have to mention worshipping a guy getting Roman corporal punishment – and yes believing not so good tasting white wafers are flesh and a communal cup of wine is blood – I hear some protestants serve grape juice instead  - but yes – Christians are general cannibals and practice cereonially eating the flesh and blood of christ at every mass and we supposedly believe we are doing that-  I should say they – I did it for a while – stretched atrms and both hands came down on top of head.  I was thinking at the time – the issue with religion is osme people like how it effectively controls people – you have to go to mass or are supposed to  - and it allows certain people to watch you and see you a lot in a predictable pattern – like I don't have to deal with that and more you can't see me get at me -  I go out as needed – no perfect scheudle – a caller on beck was saying I would destroy their way of life preach osmething ocutner to it – weren't the same arguments done with mormons – I don;t mean to keep using them – but yeah  they have some of the same issues – where the majority decides they cannot exist.  There was a realyl nasty kind of – he is saying something that will destroy our way of life and that of our children – shouldn't we kill him and stop him – phrased so they wouldn't get in trouble – but it was there. 

So perhaps demeanor hurt the jews over time, perhaps just the way events played out.  In any case god doesn;t give fully nfair shakes – you make your choices and he responds.  Maybe one day she who knwos- not right now though.   She is trying to become God by getting rid of God.   History occurred and there are reasons things happened – the Muslims did different things than the jews did and wound up in a different place. 

But everone hates the jews-  well I didn;t want to fully get into this – Hitler did think you caused the German downfall in WWI and couldn't prove it and grandma said a lot of people apparently who were rulling Germany after WWI were jewish – that is a very tender spot – but there is that general feel that jews are people you can't trust who want to scam you – with respect my own personal experience is now not so different in several noted cases and the schemes were very different and I feel pretty insideous to do to a person who had no lcue and was innocent – but they were going on and on and on -  we can get what we want if we mainpulate and not get caught – isn't Al Franken jewish – Mark was mentioning George Soros – in connection – we will get the prize – you do -  BUT EVERYBODY KNWOS YOU CHEATED  - and there is a problem – and it's like you cannot see that – anything needed to get the prize – now Pittsburgh would claim that I am little different – I would claim that Pittsburgh feels that if they pass a rule i am suppsoed to do things in a certain way – where I'm from you respect what the rules says but that doesn'tr close off all other avenues and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge you – when you stick to rules but are creative and outmanuever them – they feel that allows to break the rules- because in their mind you broke the rules -  BUT YOU DIDN'T BREAK THE RULES – AND IN TRUTH IT IS MORE AN ARGUMENT OF – WE WANTED YOU THERE – WE MADE THE RULES TO GET YOU THERE – YOU DIDN'T GO THERE – WE WANT YOU THERE -  and somehow they never got the part of the constitution that says  - THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIRECT ME  AND DEFINITELY NOT FORCE ME ANYWHERE AND YOU DID !!!!  - and to me that was part of the standing agreement and they tampled all over that – it is a fundamental difference in how the constitution works – they feel they have the right to control your actions – and if you deviate from their control then you broke a rule – they never acknowledge that that does not seem to be what the founders set up – and definitely in CT – fuck your neighbors is the general principle – you do not have to agree with your neighbors or allow to regulate past the law – and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge that- to them the rules are paper – not the glue of society – to them the will of the mob is the glue of society – and that is wrong – and that is difference – i did respect the rules i know about and fair and square I found ways around them – yo uare griping right now because i didn't pay the bills you expected me to pay – so you are going to see certain things do not show up on my door – to make it “fair” - but you have contracts to provide goods – I am under cotnract to pay the debts – there are provisions for missing payments and the various creditors do not currently have rights to force payment – nothing obligates a payment necessarily this month – that is a difference – it is not a full renegging of the cotnract – you want to get it so i have to have only so much money or take an out you predicted and I follow the advice of mum-ra when battleing opponents – never do what your enemy expects – rubbing both knees with both hands -  think it's good adivce – but that is the difference – we have a very different definition of cheating – I never lied about that – you just constantly thought you could ignore me – and you have – and I did not choose to do it your way because I thought it was wrong – I still do – and I think you will lose this argument – The Society – it is not in societal best interest for the mob or even rulers to control people in such a way – you would kill the Wright brothers-  you're not supposed to be in NC fooling around with air planes – you're supposed to be running your bike store like we wanted ya too – get back to work or we'll put you in a mental hospital.   Rubbing left knee as I got off into thinking my paino teacher was wrong as is society – the music of today is superior to classical music much of the time as it bettrer conveys experiences and emotions – my paino said over and over – classical is better than modern music – a common viewpoint – it is incorrect – modren – some of it focusses on conveying information – emotion – experience – that is the point of art to me – refining communication – liking lip – other do have a political agenda or a hidden message – but saying music today is worse – many classical songs repeat and do not build to a point or have a scripted point in themn – modern music gets to a point.  The first couple bars of Beetoven's  No 5 are neat – as are sections – but to listen to the whole song – is it as coherent a composition as almost any modern songwriter on youtube ? - most of the modern songs – have a definitive point – some are tripe – I dumped my boyfriend – I am getting in love – but most try to say something on that- things that make you go hmmm – others – tell it like it TI-is – do the elements of those build better to their concept than does a classical piece and I can think of stronger examples – even in one of the groups mentioend above – they have songs that with words build to a point – certainly wislon phillips – builds well and tells a story in words well.  “hold on for one mroe day”  - a few classical pieces do that – not that many – now for healing – classcial may be first choice – oh have to go to bathroom. 

But last piece on jews – jews want to contribute to society – yes in some cases – in some cases they want to contribute onyl after getting revenge on everyone first who has wronged anyone of their peopel over 2000 years – and that is the problem – revenge - - turn the other cheek is a catholic things and the jews – some feel the catholics are stupid for that – oddly there are a lot of catholics on the globe – the catholics were treated better than the jews and it is unfair.    - Next – please don;t tell me I have to answer that – it wil lbe like hearing about the horrors of eco-waste for the next coule years-  - there is always a created problem though isn't there ? - eco-waste is there – but it is not the end of the world – as is proposed.  Changed position of this cord to the computer keyboard – so it doesn't get loose – noticed it got bunched up weird and I fixed that and my left index knuckle went to my forehead.

and mccain.senate.gov is slow-  the events on it are slow - that same error they do - usually on reid's site.  - uggghhh 00:06 EST 1/6/09

could not get the http tags out of my email address on the ak gov website – didn't see any. 

23:58 ESt - could not get mccain.senate.gov up - first try though - will try again - but it's that kind of error - slow my connection and contacting sites down error - and events on screen it has happened before several times - and it's midnight east coast - no one is awake to block it.  1/5/09

every event - typing in a web address on thebrowser is slowed-  it is that error again - uggghhhh 23:52 EST

computer getting very slow on internet as I bring up yahoo mail to mail down from here – I mean I get the idea – Obama won't put leftists in the cabinet as first policy – but whomever is hacking my computer- once Bus(h) hand(and) cheney are gone – there will be no one left who will prevent from doing anything they want to me – and like someone will come in my neighborhood in broad daylight and jsut say if anyone wants to complain – we have the presidnet's backing – it won'tbe that blatant – that is what will happen.  Yippee !!  - having internet issues though 30 seconds for a page load- and it lessened a bit when I stopped trying to use yahoo and made a few clicks indicating i was going somewhere else. 

Question – Nixon had his issues – ego and whatever else – did he believe in Saul Alinsky? - like with the equivalent – there was a limit – Nixon could have imprisoned Paul McCartney he did not go that far – he was in power – there is a difference even between Nixon and someone else – i see a difference – a troubling one – one last chilling thought – for tonight -

Iwill address the Arab overtreatment issue brought up tonight – tomorrow – where Arabs were treated better than jews were through history.   Should the British reconquer Brittany isn't it ?

Dave Ramsey – I “slipped” for 13 minutes.  You directly compared a house payment and rent – I must admit I was not listening intensely and perhaps something – I did not hear though – the other issue – that if something breaks in the house – taxes – houses have additional payments BESIDES the regular loan and insurance – that I hope were included together – THAT is why rent can win – and we didn't actually look into what could be rented for what-  I ahve to admit in my current neighborhood-  you might need $1000 a month for $1000 sq ft – in Pittsburgh  $800 a month would get you a duplex or row house with 3 bedrooms it appeared – those figures are older – I do know that in cases i know of – they don;t rise very quickly -like perhaps 10% or 15 % at best fro mthe time they were taken – credit cards are not as big as problem – although they are a problme – but controlling car issues and expenses and house issues and expenses – those are major expenses- the situation was set up – with 3 kids and a paper route – that prevents smaller living conditions and it's car itensive job- many people don't have that – and again – houses have varying costs – apartments do not – that can be  a huge advantage.   Though apartments depend on the ethics of your landlord – houses of course depend on the ethics of the town government and your neighbors – both cases other people can be problematic if they want to be. 

Caller's bating Mark Levin to take strong pro-jewish stance – as I listen to him refer to Al Frenken as an idiot-  I don't know if Al Franken is fully an idiot – my fur will definitely fall out over him being confirmed as a Senator after that “election” - I think wisdom is thequality that does not seem to translate. 

   “rapid lunatics violently attacking people “ “everybody is repeating what they hear” - Rachel 21:39 EST 1/5/09

Senator Biden Holding his seat – yes Mark Levin it is interesting he is doing that – I do not think the reason you gave in public that he is holding it for his son is the correct one- for one – he can't hold it long enough – or much longer.   So it might be somethging else.  Boy this is gonna be interesting. 

are we going to hear about the evils of e-waste for like the next year now – please – it is clear that other coutnries will accept it as a profit base to get currency – that is not a perfect scenario – it is not necessarily in world interest to block that – and the idea that it is the largest problem – no – not really – I'm a little more concerned – with stolen election =- lossed liberty and the expectation of waste to fund several industries – and a person said on radio the other day the the NEA was more dangerous than organized – the Nea did try to provide a service – education – so did organized crime – in some cases – wanted drugs and prostitution – organized crime does deliver its services – the Nea tries to only deliver a certain amount of service – the Nea has blocked and destroyed potentially the careers of many people – by several policies – I will include my won experiences where it decided to force me into the mental health system – and it does that to others in addition to trying not to allow the person to come into existance that would not fit into the system in the first place – it may have influence in educational television and radio – toning down the quality – the University system is not user friendly and not really best solution for business – and efforts at school are fought – I have been convinced that tenyear isn't terrible – there were considerable efforts to destroy non-NEA schools when tried by other companies-  it is a harsh thing to say that – my governor is a teacher – to blatantly say to the Nea who feels they are entrusted with children – you are worse than organzied crime-  looking at like 50 years and what is happened – and various issues – they have done significant damage and I am not fully aware of their - “extracircular” activities.    The urban schools – has interesting issues – I have only been in a few of them – it is very different from a rural school.   They don't use guns, risperdal is close to that – just no bullets.   Hospitals and schools in US have mixed up their priorities and confuse money and their supposed function – I don't feel like condmening them -  BUT – I will say – with me they have acted like the mob and definitely have functioned like a criminal unit – I cannot find too much that I can defend for the NEA – when i look at the University system – the elementary school system and I cringe at it all – I would seriously look at home school for my children – if I had them.   People want an income and are not satisfied with their jobs – and that creates a problem – And are afraid of haivng to look into something else..

- the radio got turned off while I was in the bathroom – in such a way that I have to kill the internet browser to get back the sound – it is a standard method to track me and I will try to fool it – 19:06 – passed gas while writing -

NARAl is a DAMclient – 100% approval I would fear – if from them – but they may not like him and know that is a way to get him out of office in Texas.   Gambling though – not in favor of that – Environmentalism – mixed – but afraid of most people who CLAIM to be environmentalists – so the TX speaker  candidate – may nto get my vote – but nor may craddock – there should be an honest person somewhere – he oculd be honest – no real info on him.   I'd have to dig and my plate is kind fo full.   Welfare expansion – it depends – but no in general – I have shuddered at that enough.   - it is incorrect more than likely to call him Herr Strauss – German noble title – still he may balance TX more than hurt – he needs the Governor and the Senate.   - Ah the irritable bowels syndrome commercial – the CIA commercial airs mroe than it does now – that is reversed.  Rubbing by left mouth corner with left thumb. 


I was looking at the Aspect book of Air fro mwhite wolf with the spells in it – the system is slightly like the one I am trying to develop – asnd white wolf just appeared-  BUT it has significant differences – it appears less refined – and I can site where than the system I am coming up with – I of course have not fully PUBLSIHED my system for people to know about – and you have been trying to demonstrate to me like in radio calls – that everything i do is already thought of – that one time on the allen hunt show when he wanted to talk with Atheists – or non-church goers – but you are lying – or not being fully truthful – there is refinement in what I rpoposed that is not in anything I've seen – it is incremental – but some of it is still novel – and it is not vain to try to innovate – it bothers me greatly – you want nothing left of me – and my side still keeps me busy so I can't do too much - “we're in a national crisis” - OH PLEASE YES – BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GAME PLAN AND BE HONEST – you kind of want a leash on me – andthe computer slowed the cursor slowed with the text – so someone in copying the text or something as I type – and to completel the thought – you don;t really a right to leash me – not by law- Tesla – also was not – the law bent for him – against him in odd ways to affect a better national  security – it's not fun having your ability to do whatever you want taken away – I am not allwoedto finish or fully write out – I seem to get distracted  before I finish anything strongly – the other side seems to lakc the pwoerto do that over time – only one side can like push on you for months to not do something and follow up with -please don't fight us – but it is frustrating -  CIA ad 18:35 EST 1/5/09 – but I can and found several innovation – most a needed innovation in gaining experoence – can I flesh that idea out?   - it is too soon to call it done – but – you do spin me a little to prevent me from running myself- not happy about that.  - and it is disconcerted to see that people appear to know my paper notes before I even get them typed up they are being challenged – I bet that is never suppsoed to happen – and I am passed wind like a wild goose.

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

even boortz.com is lsow - the events are slow 1/6/09 11:52 ESt – the scroll bars – scrolling down to hit the submit is the biggest headache on boortz and on several senate sites – the up and down scroll bar stops working – you can only use the arrows and the response is delayed – 30 seconds. 

People are not happy about other people dying and losing their homes – but are only too happy to harass me – an interesting – “fair” standard -

rumbling in the area – motor not sure what ti is – can't see it – I would guess a plane -not the typical commercial plane.  11:45 EST 1/6/09

Laura Ingrahm – the coroner – how to live longer – wear gloves watch hands – well I don't – seem to be fine – and she started off with you could be a mess inside - - the internet is back on computer – bees flying into car windows – a lot of people get convertibles though.   - she is a medical examiner -  
totally ignoring and not listening to me – the patient said that or the  person – the person speaking saide that and I didn't pay attention to what she was saying and she didn't probably get to threaten in some way so at times it is good to ignore people.  True.  11:43 EST  1/6/09 – sort of sun break through the clouds – happens a lot right now. 

a pilot died at cherry point during the holidays and a marine died – and someone local may have wanted to complain to me – I think knocking off my harassment is a small thing to do – you're not supposed to do it anyway -

11:26 Internet connection at the station – the line is down – not my computer – a gift form the devils who are afraid of me getting a book about them – burning throat a little. 

Again both sides had t ocooperate to get me to screw up – I can see where the military thinks that a good lesson – you had to induce the problem – I said I don;t approve of that – I can't stop you – I don't agree with doing that as it goes to trust – you don't listen to me – or ignore what I say there – and this is a test of me – but we ahve no standing contract – the contract we have is fudged and I'm sorry – you lied and misrepresented to get what you watned – you didn't need to do this to me - - but it's not about my protection right now – it's about the test about testing me – you shouldn't really have that right without an agreement and you don't have what I feel is a valid agreement – the contract is usually spelled out when you get it = not written in invisible ink.  And to other – I screwed up – you cheated to get me to screw – with ebay – you had the people on your side not even allow the conditions to duplicate – whatever – like it doesn't count if you cheat and it looks like you cheated – didn;t balance the checkbook – but I did baloance the checkbook unless something extraordinary happened OR I made a math error and I know you were trying to get me to do that – make a small error I wouldn;t catch.  Apparently for around $30-40   and a lot of what is said on the radio are threats that I'm better ignoring than listening to – you never will say things in a way where it is clear.  It's intelligence to get our message – well I choose to ignore them and I guess I better work on whether I cross the Canadian border – Mexican border and swim out of the country – yes I normally don't go out more than 5 feet here because of what could be and is out there – it is unacceptable the deal proposed – my money is my money – if it's not it is how much it is not upfront – you don't get to direct me whrere you want – that will not be – I suspended because I thought help was needed – it is not a permanent condition.   The book should have also been availabe the first time – and you cheated there too – I wasn't allowed to get it and then I definitely had enough money – I won;t live in your country – it won't be my country -  as the military no doubt jet flies overhead 11:19 Est – you had to cheat to win – with a real opponent you may not be able to cheat – there are scenarios where you can't fix things – if you have a system structured around cheating – it could all blow up in your face in one instant.   You lose by winning.  Because of how you won.   It should have worked 3 or 4 times and you had to block and block and block.  And I could go without internet, TV, or radio for 14 more days.  Longer potentially. 

Somehow my checking account was off by $30-40 and I was balancing it the whole way – why did the $40 amazon order go through – 2 days ago -  I canceled that and bought something else-  unless the cancellation doesn;t rescind the money immediately – because last night I placed a third party order and the sales bounced most of them – but the amazon sales never bounced and what happened several times with the new sales is it would say in stock and then  be out of stock – what gives – if there was  a shortfall and I somehow made an accounting error it should have shown up with the new items ordered directly from amazon several times – but in each of those cases – even if the items were in stock – they would be taken out of stock – and I checked the last time to make sure the items were in stock – and it didn't matter once I placed the order – how did it get off – was there a charge withheld – from last month – I  know a caller made the comment on radio balance the checkbook – not balancing the checkpoint – that shouldn't have been an issue – I balanced to the check and to blanace that came in – and as there is one inflow that should have been sufficient – the only way it's not is if a charge came in from last bills – but there shouldn't be one – I shouldn;t have had to check last month because enough time was allowed for things to clear..  - the balance did say $10 last night and it didn'teven register -because I had calculated and trsuted the calculated – and you won't tell me what they did to throw it off and it is clear they planned to throw it off..   Why did amazon cooperate? - because they did – it would have been much less of a problem to loose the two items from amazon – but you wouldn't let that happen – every order I placed with amazon – i placed like 3 orders for amazon things-  and none of them were there  and the last time – I checked availability first – and the items disappeared when I ordered them – what gives is amazon hositle? - Why are you making a deal with them – unless you plan to kill me too – and everything is fine – this was an experiment and now you kill me – I could see that – because that couldn't have occurred without cooperation – why does that keep happening where you blantantly cooperate with the other side – I don;pt understand that took time up – and you meant to waste my time and make shop and you knew you'd take it all away.  Fuck you  -there is a reason – whatever – so neither one of you may help me in the end – and everything didn't happen or something – what am I to make of this – this is another one where both of you cooperated to go at me – I'm not changing – kill me then – If yo uwon;t give me the rules and let me make decisions – I didn't give to churches in the past – and definitely – I came to the conclusion that charity has its time and it is not every time and I don't think its now – and yo uare again changing the rules-  nothing is said it is done and I find that unfair – like the rules are never the rules there are additional rules-  no one like playing a role playing game like that – where the DM – actually paranoia is based on that- but in normal role playing – that is what breaks out the arguments and the frustrations is the when the DM – well I didn;t want you to go there so – I kind of changed things – it's not a game if the DM always wins – or has perfect control – and you are no longer playing a fair game with  - not having bus fair in Pittsburgh with the full groceries and thinking I had it – I don't approve and at some point you will need my help and i may not cooperate – because you like just forcing me to do what you wantand that's not how it's to work. 

Herr Strauss – prat on TX – again he does nto sound super ethical and I wish there were someone else-  he is not the governor and he is not in fully control and he can be managed – and letting him voice opposition opinion may be good for TX even if he is sleezeball – or sounds like it.  - he will hang himself if he is a sleezeball.

wizards don'tgenerally build bunkers when they can create antoher dimension to go into – and with Barack Obama I think I may need to go into another dimension he would go after my bunker.  -

1/6/09 -8:35 EST – computer is slow on internet – like last night – despite measure to alter – a little slow to get to new sites . 

star registry -commercial kfyo – one of the guys when I was in temporary labor for 2 days – the first day the guy who was my boss – had a star registry thing in his car.  - but he and the other one -gave the pittsburgh story of being hand to mouth and sick and have to keep going – and I now realize that was a line – it was Pittsburgh's way of pushing me away from what i was doing which would have potentially  hurt their plans.  Even a small amount of income – would have been hard for them to control so they gave me the worst jobs to discourage me from taking more -and that was planned – like spanish – the argentinian non-credit spanish teacher – they moved to break my connection with her-  they did the same with temporary labor so they could control me better.

Mark Levin – I should hear the whole show – of 1/5/09 still missing a few minutes in the middle but two main threads of thought where a gauntlet goes down -

I do feel a bit – I used the anology of a trapper keeper or there was something similar from meade where a gorilla was i9n the commercial and he stomped and and tried to tear it up and then after all that used it – I fell kind of like – oh a little tickle in throat – we are in the morning – th's addressed- it got me to think about carrying the packages that came yesterday up the stairs in my right arm – nd the joints were oddly in pain – we do keep down the meat I have – it's never red meat – it's white or turkey and it is – Ican only have os much of it – she only puts a portion out never serves the whole much of the time and she is doing sauces – tomato sauce doesn't make it that often – and I know they are trying to get me sick – we couldn't let me had all the vitamins – like we didn't let me buy that a while back – like the books at amazon where they just go out of stock if you don't want me to buy them – I tried to buy something really high in nutrients – and you wouldn't let me get it – geting onto other thoughts and  getting farther away from topic – could discuss classical music – or issues with dinner-  I will note that the classical CD from walmart arrived yesterday – it is scratchy – skips quite a bit – and something seems wrong with it on day 1 – it does play currently – I am not overly fond of the selections – the one that i thought i would like for sure which was the reason I got the Cd – that dirge is normally done in heavy organ music and this CD has a much lighter feel to a dirge which highly inappropriate-  much weaker – someone got rid anytthing in walmart for $1.88 that would appeal to me I have a feeling – because I was struggling and this was a compromise – I knewthat getting it – but even this – the key part is messed up – a dirge that is played more like a lullaby – someone manipulated so that I would get very little I wanted to hear at home.   - I had criticism – with the scary sounds- actually mother gave it to me – I guess I'll write fast – it got – I may have thrown it out – something happened to it – but I had a tape of scary soudns where the sounds did a very good job of painting a picture of a story – it took you very well from outside a haunted by sound to inside to different scenes in the haunted house and there was organ music in the house that got louder and louder and at the end of the tape you were in the room with the organ music and the house exploded – witches cackling and the regular-  but all around that theme – I ahve been looking for something ever since 2004 – and I have not found it – the organization of the sounds and the way you can imagine the various scenes and there is a point to the sounds placed that makes the tape – classical music suffers from this – repeating patterns – there is no strong story many times – not every time – but many times – there's only a melody that doesn't repeat for a minute – versus a constantly changing melody throughout the song- modern songs – may nto change melody throughout – but the words change and thus it is always new in some part – classicla doesn;t have words – unless you include opera.   Carmina Burana – does change throughout.   The moonlight sonata changes a lot as well and builds well – at least through a movement which is enough – it doesn't really build movement to movement.  - done with music – I am worried how my “doctor” will affect my long term health with the nutrition and knowing she is trying to control what I eat – and what nutrients get in my body.   I sort of keep a can of the pizza sauce – tomatoes that I know tastess pretty good by me as a ward against mother dearest – that if she fights hard this way – I have one thing left- touching forehead to first two right index figner joints- 
I realize that the constant questions are not necessarily meant for discussion they are meant to make me feel like a beat up suitcase and the constant presure is kept up by manyt people not to be honest – but just to win through wearing me down – it does take away energy from other things – and I won't hide that that bothers me – that being the punching bag to prevent the mob from getting to castle freankenstien and killing the scientist and creation is not what I wanted.  Mother might be up – or the friendly devils are starting their morning bombing practice  - fur elise is growing on me – as their is some complexity – still was looking for an encore to the moonlight Sonata #3 – and that is not here – I guess mother was and I spoke to her early this morning so what will happen to me innards now that she has that-  I usualy try not to speak to her till dinner time – somehow I have less issues in my body that way-  I left one thing above – I wonder if people could n't make soundscapes-  of mvoing through a farm – a factory – an office – the day at work – a thunderstom- a montage I guess of sound – but one to illustrate an experience – to educate through the sounds heard what a life is like- computer science might even be interesting.  - a thought – mother did just speak with me 6:13 EST – I took a little vitamin C for my sore throat and until mother spoke with me – I bet I wans't gettingsick today – now she will work on it all day. 

Not getting on to the important things – the two points presented for argument – stopping to put a blanket on as I get to them and notice my side is cold so I am shifting – before I need to go to the bahtroom which will come let me try to write.

The first point – is that if you take away traditional worship – some seem to have concluded that inevitably leads to failure – Mark Levin was arguing that both fascism and socialism rejected God and that others feel that is what happens when you reject God – I will leave out most physical signs while typing – the toes -  the are doing distractions so i ahve to fight that – but that is the basic argument if you leave out God you get a failed state – some people are not fully honest that they like people to fear God and leave that myth of god because they are easier to manipulate and won't seek fully to understand and deduce out what is going on behidn the scenes if it is just God and God just can do things.   Certain people like to use that to exploit people, and they use that to control people through church – neither a worthy objective.  But both yes Karl Marx is ocrrect perhaps in saying that in truth religion is an opiate of the masses – to a large degree – that blind faith without any understand – I don't support that – blind with understanding is something that I support, but Marx is correct that religion can be an opiate to the masses and definitely I don't like the way the other side likes people so fully deluded that they make illogical choices which the other side likes because it keeps the 2 tiers of society as they are – which is the intention.  - got off thinking of changing the music – 6:27 – but that socialism will lead to destruction – how much different is libertarianism from socialism – getting off shouldn't bring uop that thought – but there is nothing wrong – in ideal – with trying to provide needed resources to people and correcting the abuses of capitalism – there is nothing in that ideal- and yes – that gets me on a tact into thoughts I don;t want to do right now – I was going to say socialism may be like the light bulb – where the system isn't right and something else needs to be looked at – not state run – I have to think on it-  the first version of our constitution failed too though – as a reminder – the Us was not an automatic success story – and the issues in the US system are there and saying it can't get any better than this – that is bunk -  but I wanted to note – to toally blow up this argument – that Sadam Hussein had essentially a Fascist state and instead of running from religion  HE EMBRACED RELIGION – religion works well and that need to go to church can be used well in a fascist state if the state runs the church or controls it.  The South used the church with slaves to teach obedience ortried to use it that way.  It was a source of freedom because the wrong bible passages got used – but the Southerners tried to correct for that and essentially Hitler was Smarter and Hussein was smarter – they never read the wrong bible passages – just kept in the people's ears what they wanted to hear- yes we can,  yes we can – But i can definitely say that religious fascism works well – but that was Isalm Christianity could never do that – oh boy – what about the forming of the Protestant religions in Europe during the reformation or enlightenment – 1800s isn't it or 1700's actually Napolean's era.   Euroep has a lot of history – we're getting to Israel – that's next question.   Catholicism had a brush or two of being totalitarian and being corrupt in its past.  And yes kids – perhaps you should ask the mormons whether the other protestant religions are not capable of making a totalitarian state – isn't there a reason the mormons went to Utah. 

Okay second part ofthe first qeustion socialism – well that didn't work – next – but what can we learn? - that if turn off belief blindly and there is no replacement that that does not work  -I am not proposing that and I am not proposing socialism the way it was – I want to hold on my proposal – not hold back- I haven't fully formed it – I like and see the need for a market or the use for one – but clearly – i feel that social customs are changing because of education and that – they are trying to make me forget – that there it is – that the modern systems are too good at fooling the market – that is being so fully demonstrated right now it isn't funny – you're not supposed to be able to do censorship via good pricing  in capitalism – unless there is a sincere need – but you're not supposed to be able to take an idea off a capitlist market – and with the dungeons and dragons price fixing thing – you are trying to – yo uare trying to now stifle in role-playing with me-  is this what you did to art and do to music -  YOU ARE BY YOUR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THAT CAPITALISM IS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOR  - the market was there to equalize and to allow exchange of products – it was not there to be a vehicle by which to deny products – and while it is clear others are fighting back – you can effectively deny me a book or two – and put them way out of my price range – and deny me their contents in my studies – which means you can do it with anything and you are trying to set up that system – where price controls who gets access to what knowledge.   NO – this shows that the US version of capitalism needs modification more than anything else – this display that has been put on.    I do not have an example of God in socialism – but it could be – clearly in Ravenloft – they propose an example of socialism with religion – Zakata – I would have to look – there is a cleric that rules one of the terror domains – and you redistribute crops – and you starve a family member as part of the religion – it is a horror thing – but the proposal could be feasible as socialism system with religion – noyt the starvation though humans do a lot of crazy thngs in real life – but the use of God to encourage socialism – Jesus and the early Catholics there is that passage – they weren't super capitalists - - let me find the ravenloft reference -  in Ravenloft the example is G'Henna is the land the lord of it is Yagno Petrovna – it's a myth but a clear example of how a scoialist systrem could work with the church as a center – and there are real examples – the puritans did socialism – the US puritans – I was going to look at Buddhism and India where Brahins are above princes in the social hierarchy – but no the puritans suffice – the purtians did a socialist system based on religion – we had socialism in the US – but it didn;t work – AH but that doesn't matter to the proof – socialsim isn;t perfect in Europe either-  the question was not whether socialism worked – but whether not beloieving in God lead to socialism – I have given counterexamples where believing in God not only may not protect you from socialism or fascism  - BUT instead religion is an excellent enhancer of both socialism and fascims and  KEEPING PEOPLE BELEIVING THINGS THAT ARE NOT LOGICAL AND KEEPING THEM IN A STATE WHERE THEY DO NOT QUESTION I BELIEVE IS MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOCIALIST OR FASCIST STATE -  the land of strawberry short cake or caillhou – everything is perfect.  There is no evil. 

Oh boy and that is question one – and now question – poor jews – I kind of want this one to be quick so – I will address directly 

Muslims are Islamo-Nazis who want to kill everyone including all other nations – I do nto think this ids what they want – I don't bin Laden and Hamas are the same person or belief system – same with Iran – I do not know there belief system  - in general Arab culture feels that Madonna and encouragement of homosexality – encouragement of pronography of drugs of sex of rich and poor through lending money – Isalm teaches and feels that this situations which arise in the west are evil from what I udnerstand  it views the freedom of women as perhaps a reason for the coming immorality that is sees i nthe west -  IF I HAVE IT RIGHT – IT'S ARGUMENTS ARE NOT SO DISSIMILAR FRO MCONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS SECTS IN THE US  - Isalm wants to wipe out what it sees as evil – We do not seem to want to take a critical look at what our style of capitlaism has encouraged in our culture and not look at that some things we do are nto so defensible – Isalm is saying we have a better solution – our way is better – that may not be true – but they have an objection to our culture and instead of answering it – wesay they are terrorists for not wanting to be caught up in our culture and we are ignorant of the idea that our culture affects them and their children – in honesty the Islamic fundamentalist argument against the US – is the much different than the Christian fundamentalist argument against me – or Pittsburgh's argument against me – though I am trying to address yo+ur concerns – you instead send an army to suppress the muslims – there was some good intent – the US military -many of its memeber do not love te muslims – or even toelrate them with equality – and definitely to the military the thought eradicate the threat to the US – versus needing to win a discussion – most of the US will not have that discussion with Islam which is what will end the war – you have to separate the true terrorists from the people who believe we are evil through hopefully ignorance -  THOUGH I AM STARTING TO WONDER ON THAT POINT -  you are not showing the best side of our tolerant democracy with me – there is some terror for terror's sake – bin Laden can hoenstly claim – you didn't listen to anything else and the peaceful people weren't getting through to you – it took blowing up the world center to get your attention in any menaingful way to that we have concerns you are wrong nad you are affecting our children – and looking into my homeland -  THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT A CORRUPT CULTURE WHICH ALLWOS THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY AREN'T THERE SOME OF YOU BILLIONAIRES WHO MADE MONEY OFF THE HOUSING CRISIS – and I forgot the next thought – but something like – we are having objections from our society to look into cleaning it up and addressing some of the issues – I had a stronger point – but it was along those lines – and we do need to address apaprently fairly large corruption – many US people who opted for a corrupt system as long as they get a good job.  Needed to clean nose all the sudden – but there are oddly issues – ah – I was going to say above – the issues that have turned up have proved Bin Ladin partially right that there is corruption and there are problems in western culture – the yes we can  . . . . destroy all your liberty movement is not proving Bin Laden wrong.  I knwo I should take a southern attitude and just disagree without being disagreeable and not discuss it like has been done for several decades which has led to this wondrous position we are currently in .  It is going to be cool turning the internet connection  back on  and you have to read al lthis – contemplating the music – you can have complexity in a softer way in music –this morning it works – but normally I want it a little faster – more complicated – got into a loop – mental loop – rubbed back of head iwht right hand as I realizedthat.  7:20 EST

Now the poor Jews part from Mark Levin
Arabs keep all their land – we never get our land-  I have to check census – there are a lot more arabs than jews – for recorded history they have always been in that region after Mohammed and those events took place -  THAT IS HOW THINGS WOUND UP -  they were occupied too – they did not keep Austria which is where the Ottoman empire used to extend to.  - it might be interesting to look up why constantinople fell and became Istanbul – like the other Christians acted kind of like people are acting now and allowed a tragedy to occur.  Rome and Italy and Russia were disinterested fro what I remember of history and would not aid Constantinople in staying alive.  - mother asked if she could takethe package to the post office for me – demonstrating myh inability to do basic things without assistance.   Ant got in a loop and rubbed top of head as I got out of it.  In History the jews have not been in Israel before 1950 ish for many hundreds of years I beleive – Israel was a state that ceased to exist – we ahve a bibilical claim – or a claim in the torah to ti – we were there – like should Ares and Mars and Jove be the principle religion of Israel – it is history – it wasn't a current claim in 1950 – in addition owning land was invented in the UK in 1700s wasn't it – the jews were in Israel in the past – and come back to Israel – saying it had to be theirs by a biblical claim on the land – we don't really want to start doing that – because like the Aztecs would demand mexico – the Pequots would demand CT – other indian US tribes would demand a lot – Europe would be a mess again – should the British reconquer Britanny isn't it inf France – the stuff the 100 years war was about?  - The jewish claim to Israel in 1940 or whatever was not any stronger than that-  Arabs havne't been fully better treated – they lost different wars and had a different history with their land than the jews and the jews chose not to have a coutnry elsewhere – that was a choice – it had to be Israel – uggghh0-  that is not what the plymouth rock pilgrims chose.   And yes I do not recognize the torah nor the bible nor the Qu'ran – there is a new spelling – as legal documents or unchangeable rationales – jews don't recognize mecca as sacred – but Islam says it is so – Is Rome not holy? - BUT – with a country you do ask for international recognition and that is not done in a religious text – but that is the claim of Israel – or how it started -   Mark mentioned 500,000 jews thrown off land – by Arabs – I don;t knwo the time period on that – And 500,000 comapared to what – how many were in Palestine? - there are 400,000 in Gaza in addition to the disruption to egypt – Iraq – again I identified the middle east as one of two big poweder kegs on the world surface – for the US – China and then the middle east -  INDIA AND PAKISTAN WITH LIKE 1 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ARE LESS OF A PROBLEM I THINK – CONSUME LESS TIME AT THE STATE DEPEARTMENT THAN ISRAEL  - you decided to uproot people from the land they were currently living on and force them into a state where you were dominat – and did so on a biblical claim – claim of a religious – the pope of the past tried with the crusades – it didn't work out so hot.  Weren't the arabs there in 1000 AD ? - like it was the Christians against the Arabs.  The arab people and religion made different choices – where they made good ones they made out -  where they didn't things happened – perhaps certain ideas in Judaism have not led to the most successful society and that is the cause of past troubles -

The world hates us – I really didn't shout this – but there is a sense – I definitely have gotten this in spades – there is this -  NONE OF YOU MATTER THIS IS VAT OUR HOLY TEXT SAYS WE SHOULD DO AND WE WILL DO IT – AND NONE OF YOUR BELIEFS OR YOUR VALUES MATTER – WE WILL PRETEND TO LISTEN NICELY AND THEN DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY  - WE ARE THE CHOSEN OF GOD – YOU ARE NOT  -  that doesn't go over too well with the neighbors – that like in the end their beliefs are crap and you have no intenion of respecting any of them – it does come out – I realize these days not every jew feels the way of the above statement – but it is there – I had a jewish boss tell me he was not jewish enough because a baptisement in Israel is worth more than one done in the US – that is scary to me as a concept.  And it is not based on a rational belief – religious beliefs are not always rational – Shiite muslims – and the suffering for their cleric who died in that ceremony where they cut their scalps – the jews just believe their religious text – words a jew wrote down for eternity entitle them to a piece of land in Asia I guess technically – ya know in several million years it will all be lava ? - what then?    Will the jews occupy Israel when it is molten rock or as it falls into the earth ? - it happens in time – rubbed face with left hand like 5 lines up .  Scratching privates – nearly got into a loop -  

it is hard in this century to deal with customs based in relgiion – sacred burial rights on ski slopes in CO – no I am not a full fan and some time in the future – those lands may be less sacred – it is not rational – for now – we don't need them – would any of the indian tribes ever explore rejoining the  US?   Canada and the US may join before that happens.  I will not force that – just saying it is not the jews who are the only who do odd things because of religion – okay okay – you didn;t have to mention worshipping a guy getting Roman corporal punishment – and yes believing not so good tasting white wafers are flesh and a communal cup of wine is blood – I hear some protestants serve grape juice instead  - but yes – Christians are general cannibals and practice cereonially eating the flesh and blood of christ at every mass and we supposedly believe we are doing that-  I should say they – I did it for a while – stretched atrms and both hands came down on top of head.  I was thinking at the time – the issue with religion is osme people like how it effectively controls people – you have to go to mass or are supposed to  - and it allows certain people to watch you and see you a lot in a predictable pattern – like I don't have to deal with that and more you can't see me get at me -  I go out as needed – no perfect scheudle – a caller on beck was saying I would destroy their way of life preach osmething ocutner to it – weren't the same arguments done with mormons – I don;t mean to keep using them – but yeah  they have some of the same issues – where the majority decides they cannot exist.  There was a realyl nasty kind of – he is saying something that will destroy our way of life and that of our children – shouldn't we kill him and stop him – phrased so they wouldn't get in trouble – but it was there. 

So perhaps demeanor hurt the jews over time, perhaps just the way events played out.  In any case god doesn;t give fully nfair shakes – you make your choices and he responds.  Maybe one day she who knwos- not right now though.   She is trying to become God by getting rid of God.   History occurred and there are reasons things happened – the Muslims did different things than the jews did and wound up in a different place. 

But everone hates the jews-  well I didn;t want to fully get into this – Hitler did think you caused the German downfall in WWI and couldn't prove it and grandma said a lot of people apparently who were rulling Germany after WWI were jewish – that is a very tender spot – but there is that general feel that jews are people you can't trust who want to scam you – with respect my own personal experience is now not so different in several noted cases and the schemes were very different and I feel pretty insideous to do to a person who had no lcue and was innocent – but they were going on and on and on -  we can get what we want if we mainpulate and not get caught – isn't Al Franken jewish – Mark was mentioning George Soros – in connection – we will get the prize – you do -  BUT EVERYBODY KNWOS YOU CHEATED  - and there is a problem – and it's like you cannot see that – anything needed to get the prize – now Pittsburgh would claim that I am little different – I would claim that Pittsburgh feels that if they pass a rule i am suppsoed to do things in a certain way – where I'm from you respect what the rules says but that doesn'tr close off all other avenues and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge you – when you stick to rules but are creative and outmanuever them – they feel that allows to break the rules- because in their mind you broke the rules -  BUT YOU DIDN'T BREAK THE RULES – AND IN TRUTH IT IS MORE AN ARGUMENT OF – WE WANTED YOU THERE – WE MADE THE RULES TO GET YOU THERE – YOU DIDN'T GO THERE – WE WANT YOU THERE -  and somehow they never got the part of the constitution that says  - THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIRECT ME  AND DEFINITELY NOT FORCE ME ANYWHERE AND YOU DID !!!!  - and to me that was part of the standing agreement and they tampled all over that – it is a fundamental difference in how the constitution works – they feel they have the right to control your actions – and if you deviate from their control then you broke a rule – they never acknowledge that that does not seem to be what the founders set up – and definitely in CT – fuck your neighbors is the general principle – you do not have to agree with your neighbors or allow to regulate past the law – and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge that- to them the rules are paper – not the glue of society – to them the will of the mob is the glue of society – and that is wrong – and that is difference – i did respect the rules i know about and fair and square I found ways around them – yo uare griping right now because i didn't pay the bills you expected me to pay – so you are going to see certain things do not show up on my door – to make it “fair” - but you have contracts to provide goods – I am under cotnract to pay the debts – there are provisions for missing payments and the various creditors do not currently have rights to force payment – nothing obligates a payment necessarily this month – that is a difference – it is not a full renegging of the cotnract – you want to get it so i have to have only so much money or take an out you predicted and I follow the advice of mum-ra when battleing opponents – never do what your enemy expects – rubbing both knees with both hands -  think it's good adivce – but that is the difference – we have a very different definition of cheating – I never lied about that – you just constantly thought you could ignore me – and you have – and I did not choose to do it your way because I thought it was wrong – I still do – and I think you will lose this argument – The Society – it is not in societal best interest for the mob or even rulers to control people in such a way – you would kill the Wright brothers-  you're not supposed to be in NC fooling around with air planes – you're supposed to be running your bike store like we wanted ya too – get back to work or we'll put you in a mental hospital.   Rubbing left knee as I got off into thinking my paino teacher was wrong as is society – the music of today is superior to classical music much of the time as it bettrer conveys experiences and emotions – my paino said over and over – classical is better than modern music – a common viewpoint – it is incorrect – modren – some of it focusses on conveying information – emotion – experience – that is the point of art to me – refining communication – liking lip – other do have a political agenda or a hidden message – but saying music today is worse – many classical songs repeat and do not build to a point or have a scripted point in themn – modern music gets to a point.  The first couple bars of Beetoven's  No 5 are neat – as are sections – but to listen to the whole song – is it as coherent a composition as almost any modern songwriter on youtube ? - most of the modern songs – have a definitive point – some are tripe – I dumped my boyfriend – I am getting in love – but most try to say something on that- things that make you go hmmm – others – tell it like it TI-is – do the elements of those build better to their concept than does a classical piece and I can think of stronger examples – even in one of the groups mentioend above – they have songs that with words build to a point – certainly wislon phillips – builds well and tells a story in words well.  “hold on for one mroe day”  - a few classical pieces do that – not that many – now for healing – classcial may be first choice – oh have to go to bathroom. 

But last piece on jews – jews want to contribute to society – yes in some cases – in some cases they want to contribute onyl after getting revenge on everyone first who has wronged anyone of their peopel over 2000 years – and that is the problem – revenge - - turn the other cheek is a catholic things and the jews – some feel the catholics are stupid for that – oddly there are a lot of catholics on the globe – the catholics were treated better than the jews and it is unfair.    - Next – please don;t tell me I have to answer that – it wil lbe like hearing about the horrors of eco-waste for the next coule years-  - there is always a created problem though isn't there ? - eco-waste is there – but it is not the end of the world – as is proposed.  Changed position of this cord to the computer keyboard – so it doesn't get loose – noticed it got bunched up weird and I fixed that and my left index knuckle went to my forehead.

and mccain.senate.gov is slow-  the events on it are slow - that same error they do - usually on reid's site.  - uggghhh 00:06 EST 1/6/09

could not get the http tags out of my email address on the ak gov website – didn't see any. 

23:58 ESt - could not get mccain.senate.gov up - first try though - will try again - but it's that kind of error - slow my connection and contacting sites down error - and events on screen it has happened before several times - and it's midnight east coast - no one is awake to block it.  1/5/09

every event - typing in a web address on thebrowser is slowed-  it is that error again - uggghhhh 23:52 EST

computer getting very slow on internet as I bring up yahoo mail to mail down from here – I mean I get the idea – Obama won't put leftists in the cabinet as first policy – but whomever is hacking my computer- once Bus(h) hand(and) cheney are gone – there will be no one left who will prevent from doing anything they want to me – and like someone will come in my neighborhood in broad daylight and jsut say if anyone wants to complain – we have the presidnet's backing – it won'tbe that blatant – that is what will happen.  Yippee !!  - having internet issues though 30 seconds for a page load- and it lessened a bit when I stopped trying to use yahoo and made a few clicks indicating i was going somewhere else. 

Question – Nixon had his issues – ego and whatever else – did he believe in Saul Alinsky? - like with the equivalent – there was a limit – Nixon could have imprisoned Paul McCartney he did not go that far – he was in power – there is a difference even between Nixon and someone else – i see a difference – a troubling one – one last chilling thought – for tonight -

Iwill address the Arab overtreatment issue brought up tonight – tomorrow – where Arabs were treated better than jews were through history.   Should the British reconquer Brittany isn't it ?

Dave Ramsey – I “slipped” for 13 minutes.  You directly compared a house payment and rent – I must admit I was not listening intensely and perhaps something – I did not hear though – the other issue – that if something breaks in the house – taxes – houses have additional payments BESIDES the regular loan and insurance – that I hope were included together – THAT is why rent can win – and we didn't actually look into what could be rented for what-  I ahve to admit in my current neighborhood-  you might need $1000 a month for $1000 sq ft – in Pittsburgh  $800 a month would get you a duplex or row house with 3 bedrooms it appeared – those figures are older – I do know that in cases i know of – they don;t rise very quickly -like perhaps 10% or 15 % at best fro mthe time they were taken – credit cards are not as big as problem – although they are a problme – but controlling car issues and expenses and house issues and expenses – those are major expenses- the situation was set up – with 3 kids and a paper route – that prevents smaller living conditions and it's car itensive job- many people don't have that – and again – houses have varying costs – apartments do not – that can be  a huge advantage.   Though apartments depend on the ethics of your landlord – houses of course depend on the ethics of the town government and your neighbors – both cases other people can be problematic if they want to be. 

Caller's bating Mark Levin to take strong pro-jewish stance – as I listen to him refer to Al Frenken as an idiot-  I don't know if Al Franken is fully an idiot – my fur will definitely fall out over him being confirmed as a Senator after that “election” - I think wisdom is thequality that does not seem to translate. 

   “rapid lunatics violently attacking people “ “everybody is repeating what they hear” - Rachel 21:39 EST 1/5/09

Senator Biden Holding his seat – yes Mark Levin it is interesting he is doing that – I do not think the reason you gave in public that he is holding it for his son is the correct one- for one – he can't hold it long enough – or much longer.   So it might be somethging else.  Boy this is gonna be interesting. 

are we going to hear about the evils of e-waste for like the next year now – please – it is clear that other coutnries will accept it as a profit base to get currency – that is not a perfect scenario – it is not necessarily in world interest to block that – and the idea that it is the largest problem – no – not really – I'm a little more concerned – with stolen election =- lossed liberty and the expectation of waste to fund several industries – and a person said on radio the other day the the NEA was more dangerous than organized – the Nea did try to provide a service – education – so did organized crime – in some cases – wanted drugs and prostitution – organized crime does deliver its services – the Nea tries to only deliver a certain amount of service – the Nea has blocked and destroyed potentially the careers of many people – by several policies – I will include my won experiences where it decided to force me into the mental health system – and it does that to others in addition to trying not to allow the person to come into existance that would not fit into the system in the first place – it may have influence in educational television and radio – toning down the quality – the University system is not user friendly and not really best solution for business – and efforts at school are fought – I have been convinced that tenyear isn't terrible – there were considerable efforts to destroy non-NEA schools when tried by other companies-  it is a harsh thing to say that – my governor is a teacher – to blatantly say to the Nea who feels they are entrusted with children – you are worse than organzied crime-  looking at like 50 years and what is happened – and various issues – they have done significant damage and I am not fully aware of their - “extracircular” activities.    The urban schools – has interesting issues – I have only been in a few of them – it is very different from a rural school.   They don't use guns, risperdal is close to that – just no bullets.   Hospitals and schools in US have mixed up their priorities and confuse money and their supposed function – I don't feel like condmening them -  BUT – I will say – with me they have acted like the mob and definitely have functioned like a criminal unit – I cannot find too much that I can defend for the NEA – when i look at the University system – the elementary school system and I cringe at it all – I would seriously look at home school for my children – if I had them.   People want an income and are not satisfied with their jobs – and that creates a problem – And are afraid of haivng to look into something else. 

http://randy.house.gov/- 20:53 EST site is down – um I hope that is desired – 1/5/09

- the radio got turned off while I was in the bathroom – in such a way that I have to kill the internet browser to get back the sound – it is a standard method to track me and I will try to fool it – 19:06 – passed gas while writing -

NARAl is a DAMclient – 100% approval I would fear – if from them – but they may not like him and know that is a way to get him out of office in Texas.   Gambling though – not in favor of that – Environmentalism – mixed – but afraid of most people who CLAIM to be environmentalists – so the TX speaker  candidate – may nto get my vote – but nor may craddock – there should be an honest person somewhere – he oculd be honest – no real info on him.   I'd have to dig and my plate is kind fo full.   Welfare expansion – it depends – but no in general – I have shuddered at that enough.   - it is incorrect more than likely to call him Herr Strauss – German noble title – still he may balance TX more than hurt – he needs the Governor and the Senate.   - Ah the irritable bowels syndrome commercial – the CIA commercial airs mroe than it does now – that is reversed.  Rubbing by left mouth corner with left thumb. 


I was looking at the Aspect book of Air fro mwhite wolf with the spells in it – the system is slightly like the one I am trying to develop – asnd white wolf just appeared-  BUT it has significant differences – it appears less refined – and I can site where than the system I am coming up with – I of course have not fully PUBLSIHED my system for people to know about – and you have been trying to demonstrate to me like in radio calls – that everything i do is already thought of – that one time on the allen hunt show when he wanted to talk with Atheists – or non-church goers – but you are lying – or not being fully truthful – there is refinement in what I rpoposed that is not in anything I've seen – it is incremental – but some of it is still novel – and it is not vain to try to innovate – it bothers me greatly – you want nothing left of me – and my side still keeps me busy so I can't do too much - “we're in a national crisis” - OH PLEASE YES – BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GAME PLAN AND BE HONEST – you kind of want a leash on me – andthe computer slowed the cursor slowed with the text – so someone in copying the text or something as I type – and to completel the thought – you don;t really a right to leash me – not by law- Tesla – also was not – the law bent for him – against him in odd ways to affect a better national  security – it's not fun having your ability to do whatever you want taken away – I am not allwoedto finish or fully write out – I seem to get distracted  before I finish anything strongly – the other side seems to lakc the pwoerto do that over time – only one side can like push on you for months to not do something and follow up with -please don't fight us – but it is frustrating -  CIA ad 18:35 EST 1/5/09 – but I can and found several innovation – most a needed innovation in gaining experoence – can I flesh that idea out?   - it is too soon to call it done – but – you do spin me a little to prevent me from running myself- not happy about that.  - and it is disconcerted to see that people appear to know my paper notes before I even get them typed up they are being challenged – I bet that is never suppsoed to happen – and I am passed wind like a wild goose. 


there are I think more PA house members than TX – but TX has a greater population – this is what happened in PA House too – where a Democrat became speaker for the first time when the Republicans  led by 1 vote in the house in 2006.   The same thing happened – it suggests that while there is a strong majority -the fringe of the party has concerns that are not brought up.   What would anyone say to rotating the speaker – like giving the minority speaker control fo the floor for so much time – keep the votes as they are – but would it be farer to rotate and give the minority a minority of time as speaker – not give full one party rule in the house.  Allow the minority to bring up some legislation?  -

I think the host of a certain show in tX – controlling the speakership without a majority to pass liberal legislation – in addition there still is a governor and another chamber - - it may be good for texas to have laternate legislation come up through the House – please don't like do a conservative version of the Obama media. 

the caller said the smart person should be reading a newspaper and reading glasses – and by challenging the stereotype they may drag me into the helen keller comment – not unsurprising – and not inspired -  and she dropped want to scream at them – Cynthia.   - Crossing line-  is that what she said while i was writing? – ho ho ho – not nit-picking every little thing – sometimes we vary on what is little and what is big – don't we.   - she dropped Pelosi's name at the end.

probably guilty of using acronyms people don't understand.  - apparently no

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway


the new books weren't in amazon's inventory – but oddly it was advertsing them – but the new books I bought were not counted against my cash – there was an error somewhere – BUT I didn't see because the new books I bought were not coutned – the money was never deducted and no I didn't make a second check – against the checking acocunt shouldn't have had to – I sbujected from the book amoundt – assuming that came out – and each book amount was allotted for – so it should have worked – the only reason the error wasn't spotted in a nicer way was that none of the books listed at amazon were in stock – they all became out of stock as I ordered them – but there still had to be a math error or a new charrge – you did cheat – twice – you got me -  YOU CHEATEDLIKE HOLY HELL AND ON TOP OF TI WOULD NOT LET ME PURCHASE NEW BOOKS TO FIND THE ERROR -THAT WAS REJECTED TWICE – YOU MADE SURE I SPENT A FEW HOURS GETTING USED BOOKS – TO MAKE IT HURT – YO UDID WASTE MY TIME – BUT YOU CHEATED EVERY WHICH WAY – WE'RE CLEVER – WHAT IF A FRIEND REFUNDED $20 – OR STUFFED IN ENVELOPES EVERY SINGLE BOOK YOU DIDN;T SHIP ME – THAT IS JUST AS FAIR AS THE WAY YOU PLAY -

mistype created www.rewardzonezone/ - it found the correct common entry rewardzonemastercard adn I clicked on it – BUT – things didn't gel and ended up with a mistype and an error screen alterting people to what I was doing. 

there were people in the mental hospital with contagious conditions and they did wear surgical masks – other patients got to wear them – and kept them on all the time.  12:57 EST 1/6/09

went to durbin.senate.gov when I meant to go to biden.senate.gov 12:53 EST 1/6/09

still having trouble at various house and senate sites-  2 senators - 2 house members - actuallymore than 2 senators - the scroll bar in message body generalyl works - but the scroll bar for the window stops working well. 

we seem to have inauthentic country boy and authentic coutnry boy – rush – my small town is not really a small town  - cause I don't act like a small towner. 

The Great American Sitcom - Militarey Trying to pull a Al Franken Election for Editing Rights
still on mccain.senate.gov- my connection is sluggish - selecting events slowed - selecting commonly stored words or answers to name and address - that selection rpovess on each field of the contact form - that was all slowed- I can look forward to more of this under an ObamaEmpire- great- - also issues with durbin.senate.gov

Is amazon going over to the dark side?

even boortz.com is lsow - the events are slow 1/6/09 11:52 ESt – the scroll bars – scrolling down to hit the submit is the biggest headache on boortz and on several senate sites – the up and down scroll bar stops working – you can only use the arrows and the response is delayed – 30 seconds. 

People are not happy about other people dying and losing their homes – but are only too happy to harass me – an interesting – “fair” standard -

rumbling in the area – motor not sure what ti is – can't see it – I would guess a plane -not the typical commercial plane.  11:45 EST 1/6/09

Laura Ingrahm – the coroner – how to live longer – wear gloves watch hands – well I don't – seem to be fine – and she started off with you could be a mess inside - - the internet is back on computer – bees flying into car windows – a lot of people get convertibles though.   - she is a medical examiner -  
totally ignoring and not listening to me – the patient said that or the  person – the person speaking saide that and I didn't pay attention to what she was saying and she didn't probably get to threaten in some way so at times it is good to ignore people.  True.  11:43 EST  1/6/09 – sort of sun break through the clouds – happens a lot right now. 

a pilot died at cherry point during the holidays and a marine died – and someone local may have wanted to complain to me – I think knocking off my harassment is a small thing to do – you're not supposed to do it anyway -

11:26 Internet connection at the station – the line is down – not my computer – a gift form the devils who are afraid of me getting a book about them – burning throat a little. 

Again both sides had t ocooperate to get me to screw up – I can see where the military thinks that a good lesson – you had to induce the problem – I said I don;t approve of that – I can't stop you – I don't agree with doing that as it goes to trust – you don't listen to me – or ignore what I say there – and this is a test of me – but we ahve no standing contract – the contract we have is fudged and I'm sorry – you lied and misrepresented to get what you watned – you didn't need to do this to me - - but it's not about my protection right now – it's about the test about testing me – you shouldn't really have that right without an agreement and you don't have what I feel is a valid agreement – the contract is usually spelled out when you get it = not written in invisible ink.  And to other – I screwed up – you cheated to get me to screw – with ebay – you had the people on your side not even allow the conditions to duplicate – whatever – like it doesn't count if you cheat and it looks like you cheated – didn;t balance the checkbook – but I did baloance the checkbook unless something extraordinary happened OR I made a math error and I know you were trying to get me to do that – make a small error I wouldn;t catch.  Apparently for around $30-40   and a lot of what is said on the radio are threats that I'm better ignoring than listening to – you never will say things in a way where it is clear.  It's intelligence to get our message – well I choose to ignore them and I guess I better work on whether I cross the Canadian border – Mexican border and swim out of the country – yes I normally don't go out more than 5 feet here because of what could be and is out there – it is unacceptable the deal proposed – my money is my money – if it's not it is how much it is not upfront – you don't get to direct me whrere you want – that will not be – I suspended because I thought help was needed – it is not a permanent condition.   The book should have also been availabe the first time – and you cheated there too – I wasn't allowed to get it and then I definitely had enough money – I won;t live in your country – it won't be my country -  as the military no doubt jet flies overhead 11:19 Est – you had to cheat to win – with a real opponent you may not be able to cheat – there are scenarios where you can't fix things – if you have a system structured around cheating – it could all blow up in your face in one instant.   You lose by winning.  Because of how you won.   It should have worked 3 or 4 times and you had to block and block and block.  And I could go without internet, TV, or radio for 14 more days.  Longer potentially. 

Somehow my checking account was off by $30-40 and I was balancing it the whole way – why did the $40 amazon order go through – 2 days ago -  I canceled that and bought something else-  unless the cancellation doesn;t rescind the money immediately – because last night I placed a third party order and the sales bounced most of them – but the amazon sales never bounced and what happened several times with the new sales is it would say in stock and then  be out of stock – what gives – if there was  a shortfall and I somehow made an accounting error it should have shown up with the new items ordered directly from amazon several times – but in each of those cases – even if the items were in stock – they would be taken out of stock – and I checked the last time to make sure the items were in stock – and it didn't matter once I placed the order – how did it get off – was there a charge withheld – from last month – I  know a caller made the comment on radio balance the checkbook – not balancing the checkpoint – that shouldn't have been an issue – I balanced to the check and to blanace that came in – and as there is one inflow that should have been sufficient – the only way it's not is if a charge came in from last bills – but there shouldn't be one – I shouldn;t have had to check last month because enough time was allowed for things to clear.  - the balance did say $10 last night and it didn'teven register -because I had calculated and trsuted the calculated – and you won't tell me what they did to throw it off and it is clear they planned to throw it off.   Why did amazon cooperate? - because they did – it would have been much less of a problem to loose the two items from amazon – but you wouldn't let that happen – every order I placed with amazon – i placed like 3 orders for amazon things-  and none of them were there  and the last time – I checked availability first – and the items disappeared when I ordered them – what gives is amazon hositle? - Why are you making a deal with them – unless you plan to kill me too – and everything is fine – this was an experiment and now you kill me – I could see that – because that couldn't have occurred without cooperation – why does that keep happening where you blantantly cooperate with the other side – I don;pt understand that took time up – and you meant to waste my time and make shop and you knew you'd take it all away.  Fuck you  -there is a reason – whatever – so neither one of you may help me in the end – and everything didn't happen or something – what am I to make of this – this is another one where both of you cooperated to go at me – I'm not changing – kill me then – If yo uwon;t give me the rules and let me make decisions – I didn't give to churches in the past – and definitely – I came to the conclusion that charity has its time and it is not every time and I don't think its now – and yo uare again changing the rules-  nothing is said it is done and I find that unfair – like the rules are never the rules there are additional rules-  no one like playing a role playing game like that – where the DM – actually paranoia is based on that- but in normal role playing – that is what breaks out the arguments and the frustrations is the when the DM – well I didn;t want you to go there so – I kind of changed things – it's not a game if the DM always wins – or has perfect control – and you are no longer playing a fair game with  - not having bus fair in Pittsburgh with the full groceries and thinking I had it – I don't approve and at some point you will need my help and i may not cooperate – because you like just forcing me to do what you wantand that's not how it's to work. 

Herr Strauss – prat on TX – again he does nto sound super ethical and I wish there were someone else-  he is not the governor and he is not in fully control and he can be managed – and letting him voice opposition opinion may be good for TX even if he is sleezeball – or sounds like it.  - he will hang himself if he is a sleezeball.

wizards don'tgenerally build bunkers when they can create antoher dimension to go into – and with Barack Obama I think I may need to go into another dimension he would go after my bunker.  -

1/6/09 -8:35 EST – computer is slow on internet – like last night – despite measure to alter – a little slow to get to new sites . 

star registry -commercial kfyo – one of the guys when I was in temporary labor for 2 days – the first day the guy who was my boss – had a star registry thing in his car.  - but he and the other one -gave the pittsburgh story of being hand to mouth and sick and have to keep going – and I now realize that was a line – it was Pittsburgh's way of pushing me away from what i was doing which would have potentially  hurt their plans.  Even a small amount of income – would have been hard for them to control so they gave me the worst jobs to discourage me from taking more -and that was planned – like spanish – the argentinian non-credit spanish teacher – they moved to break my connection with her-  they did the same with temporary labor so they could control me better.

Mark Levin – I should hear the whole show – of 1/5/09 still missing a few minutes in the middle but two main threads of thought where a gauntlet goes down -

I do feel a bit – I used the anology of a trapper keeper or there was something similar from meade where a gorilla was i9n the commercial and he stomped and and tried to tear it up and then after all that used it – I fell kind of like – oh a little tickle in throat – we are in the morning – th's addressed- it got me to think about carrying the packages that came yesterday up the stairs in my right arm – nd the joints were oddly in pain – we do keep down the meat I have – it's never red meat – it's white or turkey and it is – Ican only have os much of it – she only puts a portion out never serves the whole much of the time and she is doing sauces – tomato sauce doesn't make it that often – and I know they are trying to get me sick – we couldn't let me had all the vitamins – like we didn't let me buy that a while back – like the books at amazon where they just go out of stock if you don't want me to buy them – I tried to buy something really high in nutrients – and you wouldn't let me get it – geting onto other thoughts and  getting farther away from topic – could discuss classical music – or issues with dinner-  I will note that the classical CD from walmart arrived yesterday – it is scratchy – skips quite a bit – and something seems wrong with it on day 1 – it does play currently – I am not overly fond of the selections – the one that i thought i would like for sure which was the reason I got the Cd – that dirge is normally done in heavy organ music and this CD has a much lighter feel to a dirge which highly inappropriate-  much weaker – someone got rid anytthing in walmart for $1.88 that would appeal to me I have a feeling – because I was struggling and this was a compromise – I knewthat getting it – but even this – the key part is messed up – a dirge that is played more like a lullaby – someone manipulated so that I would get very little I wanted to hear at home.   - I had criticism – with the scary sounds- actually mother gave it to me – I guess I'll write fast – it got – I may have thrown it out – something happened to it – but I had a tape of scary soudns where the sounds did a very good job of painting a picture of a story – it took you very well from outside a haunted by sound to inside to different scenes in the haunted house and there was organ music in the house that got louder and louder and at the end of the tape you were in the room with the organ music and the house exploded – witches cackling and the regular-  but all around that theme – I ahve been looking for something ever since 2004 – and I have not found it – the organization of the sounds and the way you can imagine the various scenes and there is a point to the sounds placed that makes the tape – classical music suffers from this – repeating patterns – there is no strong story many times – not every time – but many times – there's only a melody that doesn't repeat for a minute – versus a constantly changing melody throughout the song- modern songs – may nto change melody throughout – but the words change and thus it is always new in some part – classicla doesn;t have words – unless you include opera.   Carmina Burana – does change throughout.   The moonlight sonata changes a lot as well and builds well – at least through a movement which is enough – it doesn't really build movement to movement.  - done with music – I am worried how my “doctor” will affect my long term health with the nutrition and knowing she is trying to control what I eat – and what nutrients get in my body.   I sort of keep a can of the pizza sauce – tomatoes that I know tastess pretty good by me as a ward against mother dearest – that if she fights hard this way – I have one thing left- touching forehead to first two right index figner joints- 
I realize that the constant questions are not necessarily meant for discussion they are meant to make me feel like a beat up suitcase and the constant presure is kept up by manyt people not to be honest – but just to win through wearing me down – it does take away energy from other things – and I won't hide that that bothers me – that being the punching bag to prevent the mob from getting to castle freankenstien and killing the scientist and creation is not what I wanted..  Mother might be up – or the friendly devils are starting their morning bombing practice  - fur elise is growing on me – as their is some complexity – still was looking for an encore to the moonlight Sonata #3 – and that is not here – I guess mother was and I spoke to her early this morning so what will happen to me innards now that she has that-  I usualy try not to speak to her till dinner time – somehow I have less issues in my body that way-  I left one thing above – I wonder if people could n't make soundscapes-  of mvoing through a farm – a factory – an office – the day at work – a thunderstom- a montage I guess of sound – but one to illustrate an experience – to educate through the sounds heard what a life is like- computer science might even be interesting.  - a thought – mother did just speak with me 6:13 EST – I took a little vitamin C for my sore throat and until mother spoke with me – I bet I wans't gettingsick today – now she will work on it all day. 

Not getting on to the important things – the two points presented for argument – stopping to put a blanket on as I get to them and notice my side is cold so I am shifting – before I need to go to the bahtroom which will come let me try to write.

The first point – is that if you take away traditional worship – some seem to have concluded that inevitably leads to failure – Mark Levin was arguing that both fascism and socialism rejected God and that others feel that is what happens when you reject God – I will leave out most physical signs while typing – the toes -  the are doing distractions so i ahve to fight that – but that is the basic argument if you leave out God you get a failed state – some people are not fully honest that they like people to fear God and leave that myth of god because they are easier to manipulate and won't seek fully to understand and deduce out what is going on behidn the scenes if it is just God and God just can do things.   Certain people like to use that to exploit people, and they use that to control people through church – neither a worthy objective.  But both yes Karl Marx is ocrrect perhaps in saying that in truth religion is an opiate of the masses – to a large degree – that blind faith without any understand – I don't support that – blind with understanding is something that I support, but Marx is correct that religion can be an opiate to the masses and definitely I don't like the way the other side likes people so fully deluded that they make illogical choices which the other side likes because it keeps the 2 tiers of society as they are – which is the intention.  - got off thinking of changing the music – 6:27 – but that socialism will lead to destruction – how much different is libertarianism from socialism – getting off shouldn't bring uop that thought – but there is nothing wrong – in ideal – with trying to provide needed resources to people and correcting the abuses of capitalism – there is nothing in that ideal- and yes – that gets me on a tact into thoughts I don;t want to do right now – I was going to say socialism may be like the light bulb – where the system isn't right and something else needs to be looked at – not state run – I have to think on it-  the first version of our constitution failed too though – as a reminder – the Us was not an automatic success story – and the issues in the US system are there and saying it can't get any better than this – that is bunk -  but I wanted to note – to toally blow up this argument – that Sadam Hussein had essentially a Fascist state and instead of running from religion  HE EMBRACED RELIGION – religion works well and that need to go to church can be used well in a fascist state if the state runs the church or controls it.  The South used the church with slaves to teach obedience ortried to use it that way.  It was a source of freedom because the wrong bible passages got used – but the Southerners tried to correct for that and essentially Hitler was Smarter and Hussein was smarter – they never read the wrong bible passages – just kept in the people's ears what they wanted to hear- yes we can,  yes we can – But i can definitely say that religious fascism works well – but that was Isalm Christianity could never do that – oh boy – what about the forming of the Protestant religions in Europe during the reformation or enlightenment – 1800s isn't it or 1700's actually Napolean's era.   Euroep has a lot of history – we're getting to Israel – that's next question.   Catholicism had a brush or two of being totalitarian and being corrupt in its past.  And yes kids – perhaps you should ask the mormons whether the other protestant religions are not capable of making a totalitarian state – isn't there a reason the mormons went to Utah. 

Okay second part ofthe first qeustion socialism – well that didn't work – next – but what can we learn? - that if turn off belief blindly and there is no replacement that that does not work  -I am not proposing that and I am not proposing socialism the way it was – I want to hold on my proposal – not hold back- I haven't fully formed it – I like and see the need for a market or the use for one – but clearly – i feel that social customs are changing because of education and that – they are trying to make me forget – that there it is – that the modern systems are too good at fooling the market – that is being so fully demonstrated right now it isn't funny – you're not supposed to be able to do censorship via good pricing  in capitalism – unless there is a sincere need – but you're not supposed to be able to take an idea off a capitlist market – and with the dungeons and dragons price fixing thing – you are trying to – yo uare trying to now stifle in role-playing with me-  is this what you did to art and do to music -  YOU ARE BY YOUR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THAT CAPITALISM IS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOR  - the market was there to equalize and to allow exchange of products – it was not there to be a vehicle by which to deny products – and while it is clear others are fighting back – you can effectively deny me a book or two – and put them way out of my price range – and deny me their contents in my studies – which means you can do it with anything and you are trying to set up that system – where price controls who gets access to what knowledge.   NO – this shows that the US version of capitalism needs modification more than anything else – this display that has been put on.    I do not have an example of God in socialism – but it could be – clearly in Ravenloft – they propose an example of socialism with religion – Zakata – I would have to look – there is a cleric that rules one of the terror domains – and you redistribute crops – and you starve a family member as part of the religion – it is a horror thing – but the proposal could be feasible as socialism system with religion – noyt the starvation though humans do a lot of crazy thngs in real life – but the use of God to encourage socialism – Jesus and the early Catholics there is that passage – they weren't super capitalists - - let me find the ravenloft reference -  in Ravenloft the example is G'Henna is the land the lord of it is Yagno Petrovna – it's a myth but a clear example of how a scoialist systrem could work with the church as a center – and there are real examples – the puritans did socialism – the US puritans – I was going to look at Buddhism and India where Brahins are above princes in the social hierarchy – but no the puritans suffice – the purtians did a socialist system based on religion – we had socialism in the US – but it didn;t work – AH but that doesn't matter to the proof – socialsim isn;t perfect in Europe either-  the question was not whether socialism worked – but whether not beloieving in God lead to socialism – I have given counterexamples where believing in God not only may not protect you from socialism or fascism  - BUT instead religion is an excellent enhancer of both socialism and fascims and  KEEPING PEOPLE BELEIVING THINGS THAT ARE NOT LOGICAL AND KEEPING THEM IN A STATE WHERE THEY DO NOT QUESTION I BELIEVE IS MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOCIALIST OR FASCIST STATE -  the land of strawberry short cake or caillhou – everything is perfect.  There is no evil. 

Oh boy and that is question one – and now question – poor jews – I kind of want this one to be quick so – I will address directly 

Muslims are Islamo-Nazis who want to kill everyone including all other nations – I do nto think this ids what they want – I don't bin Laden and Hamas are the same person or belief system – same with Iran – I do not know there belief system  - in general Arab culture feels that Madonna and encouragement of homosexality – encouragement of pronography of drugs of sex of rich and poor through lending money – Isalm teaches and feels that this situations which arise in the west are evil from what I udnerstand  it views the freedom of women as perhaps a reason for the coming immorality that is sees i nthe west -  IF I HAVE IT RIGHT – IT'S ARGUMENTS ARE NOT SO DISSIMILAR FRO MCONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS SECTS IN THE US  - Isalm wants to wipe out what it sees as evil – We do not seem to want to take a critical look at what our style of capitlaism has encouraged in our culture and not look at that some things we do are nto so defensible – Isalm is saying we have a better solution – our way is better – that may not be true – but they have an objection to our culture and instead of answering it – wesay they are terrorists for not wanting to be caught up in our culture and we are ignorant of the idea that our culture affects them and their children – in honesty the Islamic fundamentalist argument against the US – is the much different than the Christian fundamentalist argument against me – or Pittsburgh's argument against me – though I am trying to address yo+ur concerns – you instead send an army to suppress the muslims – there was some good intent – the US military -many of its memeber do not love te muslims – or even toelrate them with equality – and definitely to the military the thought eradicate the threat to the US – versus needing to win a discussion – most of the US will not have that discussion with Islam which is what will end the war – you have to separate the true terrorists from the people who believe we are evil through hopefully ignorance -  THOUGH I AM STARTING TO WONDER ON THAT POINT -  you are not showing the best side of our tolerant democracy with me – there is some terror for terror's sake – bin Laden can hoenstly claim – you didn't listen to anything else and the peaceful people weren't getting through to you – it took blowing up the world center to get your attention in any menaingful way to that we have concerns you are wrong nad you are affecting our children – and looking into my homeland -  THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT A CORRUPT CULTURE WHICH ALLWOS THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY AREN'T THERE SOME OF YOU BILLIONAIRES WHO MADE MONEY OFF THE HOUSING CRISIS – and I forgot the next thought – but something like – we are having objections from our society to look into cleaning it up and addressing some of the issues – I had a stronger point – but it was along those lines – and we do need to address apaprently fairly large corruption – many US people who opted for a corrupt system as long as they get a good job.  Needed to clean nose all the sudden – but there are oddly issues – ah – I was going to say above – the issues that have turned up have proved Bin Ladin partially right that there is corruption and there are problems in western culture – the yes we can  . . . . destroy all your liberty movement is not proving Bin Laden wrong.  I knwo I should take a southern attitude and just disagree without being disagreeable and not discuss it like has been done for several decades which has led to this wondrous position we are currently in .  It is going to be cool turning the internet connection  back on  and you have to read al lthis – contemplating the music – you can have complexity in a softer way in music –this morning it works – but normally I want it a little faster – more complicated – got into a loop – mental loop – rubbed back of head iwht right hand as I realizedthat.  7:20 EST

Now the poor Jews part from Mark Levin
Arabs keep all their land – we never get our land-  I have to check census – there are a lot more arabs than jews – for recorded history they have always been in that region after Mohammed and those events took place -  THAT IS HOW THINGS WOUND UP -  they were occupied too – they did not keep Austria which is where the Ottoman empire used to extend to.  - it might be interesting to look up why constantinople fell and became Istanbul – like the other Christians acted kind of like people are acting now and allowed a tragedy to occur.  Rome and Italy and Russia were disinterested fro what I remember of history and would not aid Constantinople in staying alive.  - mother asked if she could takethe package to the post office for me – demonstrating myh inability to do basic things without assistance.   Ant got in a loop and rubbed top of head as I got out of it.  In History the jews have not been in Israel before 1950 ish for many hundreds of years I beleive – Israel was a state that ceased to exist – we ahve a bibilical claim – or a claim in the torah to ti – we were there – like should Ares and Mars and Jove be the principle religion of Israel – it is history – it wasn't a current claim in 1950 – in addition owning land was invented in the UK in 1700s wasn't it – the jews were in Israel in the past – and come back to Israel – saying it had to be theirs by a biblical claim on the land – we don't really want to start doing that – because like the Aztecs would demand mexico – the Pequots would demand CT – other indian US tribes would demand a lot – Europe would be a mess again – should the British reconquer Britanny isn't it inf France – the stuff the 100 years war was about?  - The jewish claim to Israel in 1940 or whatever was not any stronger than that-  Arabs havne't been fully better treated – they lost different wars and had a different history with their land than the jews and the jews chose not to have a coutnry elsewhere – that was a choice – it had to be Israel – uggghh0-  that is not what the plymouth rock pilgrims chose.   And yes I do not recognize the torah nor the bible nor the Qu'ran – there is a new spelling – as legal documents or unchangeable rationales – jews don't recognize mecca as sacred – but Islam says it is so – Is Rome not holy? - BUT – with a country you do ask for international recognition and that is not done in a religious text – but that is the claim of Israel – or how it started -   Mark mentioned 500,000 jews thrown off land – by Arabs – I don;t knwo the time period on that – And 500,000 comapared to what – how many were in Palestine? - there are 400,000 in Gaza in addition to the disruption to egypt – Iraq – again I identified the middle east as one of two big poweder kegs on the world surface – for the US – China and then the middle east -  INDIA AND PAKISTAN WITH LIKE 1 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ARE LESS OF A PROBLEM I THINK – CONSUME LESS TIME AT THE STATE DEPEARTMENT THAN ISRAEL  - you decided to uproot people from the land they were currently living on and force them into a state where you were dominat – and did so on a biblical claim – claim of a religious – the pope of the past tried with the crusades – it didn't work out so hot.  Weren't the arabs there in 1000 AD ? - like it was the Christians against the Arabs.  The arab people and religion made different choices – where they made good ones they made out -  where they didn't things happened – perhaps certain ideas in Judaism have not led to the most successful society and that is the cause of past troubles -

The world hates us – I really didn't shout this – but there is a sense – I definitely have gotten this in spades – there is this -  NONE OF YOU MATTER THIS IS VAT OUR HOLY TEXT SAYS WE SHOULD DO AND WE WILL DO IT – AND NONE OF YOUR BELIEFS OR YOUR VALUES MATTER – WE WILL PRETEND TO LISTEN NICELY AND THEN DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY  - WE ARE THE CHOSEN OF GOD – YOU ARE NOT  -  that doesn't go over too well with the neighbors – that like in the end their beliefs are crap and you have no intenion of respecting any of them – it does come out – I realize these days not every jew feels the way of the above statement – but it is there – I had a jewish boss tell me he was not jewish enough because a baptisement in Israel is worth more than one done in the US – that is scary to me as a concept.  And it is not based on a rational belief – religious beliefs are not always rational – Shiite muslims – and the suffering for their cleric who died in that ceremony where they cut their scalps – the jews just believe their religious text – words a jew wrote down for eternity entitle them to a piece of land in Asia I guess technically – ya know in several million years it will all be lava ? - what then?    Will the jews occupy Israel when it is molten rock or as it falls into the earth ? - it happens in time – rubbed face with left hand like 5 lines up .  Scratching privates – nearly got into a loop -  

it is hard in this century to deal with customs based in relgiion – sacred burial rights on ski slopes in CO – no I am not a full fan and some time in the future – those lands may be less sacred – it is not rational – for now – we don't need them – would any of the indian tribes ever explore rejoining the  US?   Canada and the US may join before that happens.  I will not force that – just saying it is not the jews who are the only who do odd things because of religion – okay okay – you didn;t have to mention worshipping a guy getting Roman corporal punishment – and yes believing not so good tasting white wafers are flesh and a communal cup of wine is blood – I hear some protestants serve grape juice instead  - but yes – Christians are general cannibals and practice cereonially eating the flesh and blood of christ at every mass and we supposedly believe we are doing that-  I should say they – I did it for a while – stretched atrms and both hands came down on top of head.  I was thinking at the time – the issue with religion is osme people like how it effectively controls people – you have to go to mass or are supposed to  - and it allows certain people to watch you and see you a lot in a predictable pattern – like I don't have to deal with that and more you can't see me get at me -  I go out as needed – no perfect scheudle – a caller on beck was saying I would destroy their way of life preach osmething ocutner to it – weren't the same arguments done with mormons – I don;t mean to keep using them – but yeah  they have some of the same issues – where the majority decides they cannot exist.  There was a realyl nasty kind of – he is saying something that will destroy our way of life and that of our children – shouldn't we kill him and stop him – phrased so they wouldn't get in trouble – but it was there. 

So perhaps demeanor hurt the jews over time, perhaps just the way events played out.  In any case god doesn;t give fully nfair shakes – you make your choices and he responds.  Maybe one day she who knwos- not right now though.   She is trying to become God by getting rid of God.   History occurred and there are reasons things happened – the Muslims did different things than the jews did and wound up in a different place. 

But everone hates the jews-  well I didn;t want to fully get into this – Hitler did think you caused the German downfall in WWI and couldn't prove it and grandma said a lot of people apparently who were rulling Germany after WWI were jewish – that is a very tender spot – but there is that general feel that jews are people you can't trust who want to scam you – with respect my own personal experience is now not so different in several noted cases and the schemes were very different and I feel pretty insideous to do to a person who had no lcue and was innocent – but they were going on and on and on -  we can get what we want if we mainpulate and not get caught – isn't Al Franken jewish – Mark was mentioning George Soros – in connection – we will get the prize – you do -  BUT EVERYBODY KNWOS YOU CHEATED  - and there is a problem – and it's like you cannot see that – anything needed to get the prize – now Pittsburgh would claim that I am little different – I would claim that Pittsburgh feels that if they pass a rule i am suppsoed to do things in a certain way – where I'm from you respect what the rules says but that doesn'tr close off all other avenues and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge you – when you stick to rules but are creative and outmanuever them – they feel that allows to break the rules- because in their mind you broke the rules -  BUT YOU DIDN'T BREAK THE RULES – AND IN TRUTH IT IS MORE AN ARGUMENT OF – WE WANTED YOU THERE – WE MADE THE RULES TO GET YOU THERE – YOU DIDN'T GO THERE – WE WANT YOU THERE -  and somehow they never got the part of the constitution that says  - THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIRECT ME  AND DEFINITELY NOT FORCE ME ANYWHERE AND YOU DID !!!!  - and to me that was part of the standing agreement and they tampled all over that – it is a fundamental difference in how the constitution works – they feel they have the right to control your actions – and if you deviate from their control then you broke a rule – they never acknowledge that that does not seem to be what the founders set up – and definitely in CT – fuck your neighbors is the general principle – you do not have to agree with your neighbors or allow to regulate past the law – and Pittsburgh does not acknowledge that- to them the rules are paper – not the glue of society – to them the will of the mob is the glue of society – and that is wrong – and that is difference – i did respect the rules i know about and fair and square I found ways around them – yo uare griping right now because i didn't pay the bills you expected me to pay – so you are going to see certain things do not show up on my door – to make it “fair” - but you have contracts to provide goods – I am under cotnract to pay the debts – there are provisions for missing payments and the various creditors do not currently have rights to force payment – nothing obligates a payment necessarily this month – that is a difference – it is not a full renegging of the cotnract – you want to get it so i have to have only so much money or take an out you predicted and I follow the advice of mum-ra when battleing opponents – never do what your enemy expects – rubbing both knees with both hands -  think it's good adivce – but that is the difference – we have a very different definition of cheating – I never lied about that – you just constantly thought you could ignore me – and you have – and I did not choose to do it your way because I thought it was wrong – I still do – and I think you will lose this argument – The Society – it is not in societal best interest for the mob or even rulers to control people in such a way – you would kill the Wright brothers-  you're not supposed to be in NC fooling around with air planes – you're supposed to be running your bike store like we wanted ya too – get back to work or we'll put you in a mental hospital.   Rubbing left knee as I got off into thinking my paino teacher was wrong as is society – the music of today is superior to classical music much of the time as it bettrer conveys experiences and emotions – my paino said over and over – classical is better than modern music – a common viewpoint – it is incorrect – modren – some of it focusses on conveying information – emotion – experience – that is the point of art to me – refining communication – liking lip – other do have a political agenda or a hidden message – but saying music today is worse – many classical songs repeat and do not build to a point or have a scripted point in themn – modern music gets to a point.  The first couple bars of Beetoven's  No 5 are neat – as are sections – but to listen to the whole song – is it as coherent a composition as almost any modern songwriter on youtube ? - most of the modern songs – have a definitive point – some are tripe – I dumped my boyfriend – I am getting in love – but most try to say something on that- things that make you go hmmm – others – tell it like it TI-is – do the elements of those build better to their concept than does a classical piece and I can think of stronger examples – even in one of the groups mentioend above – they have songs that with words build to a point – certainly wislon phillips – builds well and tells a story in words well.  “hold on for one mroe day”  - a few classical pieces do that – not that many – now for healing – classcial may be first choice – oh have to go to bathroom. 

But last piece on jews – jews want to contribute to society – yes in some cases – in some cases they want to contribute onyl after getting revenge on everyone first who has wronged anyone of their peopel over 2000 years – and that is the problem – revenge - - turn the other cheek is a catholic things and the jews – some feel the catholics are stupid for that – oddly there are a lot of catholics on the globe – the catholics were treated better than the jews and it is unfair..    - Next – please don;t tell me I have to answer that – it wil lbe like hearing about the horrors of eco-waste for the next coule years-  - there is always a created problem though isn't there ? - eco-waste is there – but it is not the end of the world – as is proposed.  Changed position of this cord to the computer keyboard – so it doesn't get loose – noticed it got bunched up weird and I fixed that and my left index knuckle went to my forehead.

and mccain.senate.gov is slow-  the events on it are slow - that same error they do - usually on reid's site.  - uggghhh 00:06 EST 1/6/09

could not get the http tags out of my email address on the ak gov website – didn't see any. 

23:58 ESt - could not get mccain.senate.gov up - first try though - will try again - but it's that kind of error - slow my connection and contacting sites down error - and events on screen it has happened before several times - and it's midnight east coast - no one is awake to block it.  1/5/09

every event - typing in a web address on thebrowser is slowed-  it is that error again - uggghhhh 23:52 EST

computer getting very slow on internet as I bring up yahoo mail to mail down from here – I mean I get the idea – Obama won't put leftists in the cabinet as first policy – but whomever is hacking my computer- once Bus(h) hand(and) cheney are gone – there will be no one left who will prevent from doing anything they want to me – and like someone will come in my neighborhood in broad daylight and jsut say if anyone wants to complain – we have the presidnet's backing – it won'tbe that blatant – that is what will happen.  Yippee !!  - having internet issues though 30 seconds for a page load- and it lessened a bit when I stopped trying to use yahoo and made a few clicks indicating i was going somewhere else. 

Question – Nixon had his issues – ego and whatever else – did he believe in Saul Alinsky? - like with the equivalent – there was a limit – Nixon could have imprisoned Paul McCartney he did not go that far – he was in power – there is a difference even between Nixon and someone else – i see a difference – a troubling one – one last chilling thought – for tonight -

Iwill address the Arab overtreatment issue brought up tonight – tomorrow – where Arabs were treated better than jews were through history.   Should the British reconquer Brittany isn't it ?

Dave Ramsey – I “slipped” for 13 minutes.  You directly compared a house payment and rent – I must admit I was not listening intensely and perhaps something – I did not hear though – the other issue – that if something breaks in the house – taxes – houses have additional payments BESIDES the regular loan and insurance – that I hope were included together – THAT is why rent can win – and we didn't actually look into what could be rented for what-  I ahve to admit in my current neighborhood-  you might need $1000 a month for $1000 sq ft – in Pittsburgh  $800 a month would get you a duplex or row house with 3 bedrooms it appeared – those figures are older – I do know that in cases i know of – they don;t rise very quickly -like perhaps 10% or 15 % at best fro mthe time they were taken – credit cards are not as big as problem – although they are a problme – but controlling car issues and expenses and house issues and expenses – those are major expenses- the situation was set up – with 3 kids and a paper route – that prevents smaller living conditions and it's car itensive job- many people don't have that – and again – houses have varying costs – apartments do not – that can be  a huge advantage.   Though apartments depend on the ethics of your landlord – houses of course depend on the ethics of the town government and your neighbors – both cases other people can be problematic if they want to be. 

Caller's bating Mark Levin to take strong pro-jewish stance – as I listen to him refer to Al Frenken as an idiot-  I don't know if Al Franken is fully an idiot – my fur will definitely fall out over him being confirmed as a Senator after that “election” - I think wisdom is thequality that does not seem to translate. 

   “rapid lunatics violently attacking people “ “everybody is repeating what they hear” - Rachel 21:39 EST 1/5/09

Senator Biden Holding his seat – yes Mark Levin it is interesting he is doing that – I do not think the reason you gave in public that he is holding it for his son is the correct one- for one – he can't hold it long enough – or much longer.   So it might be somethging else.  Boy this is gonna be interesting. 

are we going to hear about the evils of e-waste for like the next year now – please – it is clear that other coutnries will accept it as a profit base to get currency – that is not a perfect scenario – it is not necessarily in world interest to block that – and the idea that it is the largest problem – no – not really – I'm a little more concerned – with stolen election =- lossed liberty and the expectation of waste to fund several industries – and a person said on radio the other day the the NEA was more dangerous than organized – the Nea did try to provide a service – education – so did organized crime – in some cases – wanted drugs and prostitution – organized crime does deliver its services – the Nea tries to only deliver a certain amount of service – the Nea has blocked and destroyed potentially the careers of many people – by several policies – I will include my won experiences where it decided to force me into the mental health system – and it does that to others in addition to trying not to allow the person to come into existance that would not fit into the system in the first place – it may have influence in educational television and radio – toning down the quality – the University system is not user friendly and not really best solution for business – and efforts at school are fought – I have been convinced that tenyear isn't terrible – there were considerable efforts to destroy non-NEA schools when tried by other companies-  it is a harsh thing to say that – my governor is a teacher – to blatantly say to the Nea who feels they are entrusted with children – you are worse than organzied crime-  looking at like 50 years and what is happened – and various issues – they have done significant damage and I am not fully aware of their - “extracircular” activities.    The urban schools – has interesting issues – I have only been in a few of them – it is very different from a rural school.   They don't use guns, risperdal is close to that – just no bullets.   Hospitals and schools in US have mixed up their priorities and confuse money and their supposed function – I don't feel like condmening them -  BUT – I will say – with me they have acted like the mob and definitely have functioned like a criminal unit – I cannot find too much that I can defend for the NEA – when i look at the University system – the elementary school system and I cringe at it all – I would seriously look at home school for my children – if I had them.   People want an income and are not satisfied with their jobs – and that creates a problem – And are afraid of haivng to look into something else. 

http://randy.house.gov/- 20:53 EST site is down – um I hope that is desired – 1/5/09

- the radio got turned off while I was in the bathroom – in such a way that I have to kill the internet browser to get back the sound – it is a standard method to track me and I will try to fool it – 19:06 – passed gas while writing -

NARAl is a DAMclient – 100% approval I would fear – if from them – but they may not like him and know that is a way to get him out of office in Texas.   Gambling though – not in favor of that – Environmentalism – mixed – but afraid of most people who CLAIM to be environmentalists – so the TX speaker  candidate – may nto get my vote – but nor may craddock – there should be an honest person somewhere – he oculd be honest – no real info on him.   I'd have to dig and my plate is kind fo full.   Welfare expansion – it depends – but no in general – I have shuddered at that enough.   - it is incorrect more than likely to call him Herr Strauss – German noble title – still he may balance TX more than hurt – he needs the Governor and the Senate.   - Ah the irritable bowels syndrome commercial – the CIA commercial airs mroe than it does now – that is reversed.  Rubbing by left mouth corner with left thumb. 


I was looking at the Aspect book of Air fro mwhite wolf with the spells in it – the system is slightly like the one I am trying to develop – asnd white wolf just appeared-  BUT it has significant differences – it appears less refined – and I can site where than the system I am coming up with – I of course have not fully PUBLSIHED my system for people to know about – and you have been trying to demonstrate to me like in radio calls – that everything i do is already thought of – that one time on the allen hunt show when he wanted to talk with Atheists – or non-church goers – but you are lying – or not being fully truthful – there is refinement in what I rpoposed that is not in anything I've seen – it is incremental – but some of it is still novel – and it is not vain to try to innovate – it bothers me greatly – you want nothing left of me – and my side still keeps me busy so I can't do too much - “we're in a national crisis” - OH PLEASE YES – BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE A GAME PLAN AND BE HONEST – you kind of want a leash on me – andthe computer slowed the cursor slowed with the text – so someone in copying the text or something as I type – and to completel the thought – you don;t really a right to leash me – not by law- Tesla – also was not – the law bent for him – against him in odd ways to affect a better national  security – it's not fun having your ability to do whatever you want taken away – I am not allwoedto finish or fully write out – I seem to get distracted  before I finish anything strongly – the other side seems to lakc the pwoerto do that over time – only one side can like push on you for months to not do something and follow up with -please don't fight us – but it is frustrating -  CIA ad 18:35 EST 1/5/09 – but I can and found several innovation – most a needed innovation in gaining experoence – can I flesh that idea out?   - it is too soon to call it done – but – you do spin me a little to prevent me from running myself- not happy about that.  - and it is disconcerted to see that people appear to know my paper notes before I even get them typed up they are being challenged – I bet that is never suppsoed to happen – and I am passed wind like a wild goose. 


there are I think more PA house members than TX – but TX has a greater population – this is what happened in PA House too – where a Democrat became speaker for the first time when the Republicans  led by 1 vote in the house in 2006.   The same thing happened – it suggests that while there is a strong majority -the fringe of the party has concerns that are not brought up.   What would anyone say to rotating the speaker – like giving the minority speaker control fo the floor for so much time – keep the votes as they are – but would it be farer to rotate and give the minority a minority of time as speaker – not give full one party rule in the house.  Allow the minority to bring up some legislation?  -

I think the host of a certain show in tX – controlling the speakership without a majority to pass liberal legislation – in addition there still is a governor and another chamber - - it may be good for texas to have laternate legislation come up through the House – please don't like do a conservative version of the Obama media. 

the caller said the smart person should be reading a newspaper and reading glasses – and by challenging the stereotype they may drag me into the helen keller comment – not unsurprising – and not inspired -  and she dropped want to scream at them – Cynthia.   - Crossing line-  is that what she said while i was writing? – ho ho ho – not nit-picking every little thing – sometimes we vary on what is little and what is big – don't we.   - she dropped Pelosi's name at the end.

probably guilty of using acronyms people don't understand..  - apparently no

you can't tell your son if he can vote or not – it's his choice. 

2nd Cia ad – 16:47 EST – kfyo. 

get out of fairytale land come back to reality – I talked about fiarytales in my critique of texas tech on 60 minutes  - 16::42 EST

there is a flyover – military helicopter – fog has come up – 16:19 EST – when I found the removed item – 1 of at least 2 in amazon – it's new and in stock – they have – like in walmart – they did a buy out in almart – they did a buyout of D&D and babylon 5 and anything I was looking at in amazon  - and now – liefted items out of my shopping cart that they missed – I either buy fro mtheir sellers – or not at all – this takes money.  To do this moeny and people – they are all guilty of price fixing and controlling a market. 

cia.gov ad on kfyo – 15:54 EST – something else – mom called out as I listed this. 

so a few things disappeared from my list on amazon.com  - ho ho  - they took out two things I liked at least – 15:49 EST – i can't even get what I find. 

itching back of neck as I email governor richardson with right hand.  15:29 Est 1/5/09

someone shut off my internet connection 15:20 Est – I was going to say in time perhaps having someone who is deaf and blind as CIA chief may be possible – with different assistance – but not right now – and having someone who is potetnially ineffective as head of the CIA is “highly problematic” at this time.  - had to restart firefox web browser to regain internet – they may not like my new setup- figured out a new trick. 

yes I used to play tennis. 

India the cat has died and in the (blank)  Ashwanttaman the elephant and not the hero gets killed.   I can't think of the stories name – Vedha - - Baghavad-Ghita – tiching left thigh with left hand as I come up with that.   ASHWANTAMAN GETS KILLEDI NTHE BATTLE IN THE bAGHAVAD -GITA -  again capitalization error – it's a trick by the “good” pandoba to bring down deetra- rashtra – so victory right now may not be too pure – understood. 

Why not Appoint Helen Keller as CIA Chief ?  - I realize the handicapped are discriminated against with that statement – but I think the point caries and no one who is deaf and blind should be CIA chief
Blind CIA Head Why Not
so we appointed a Cia chief who is ignorant of spying – going for the equal opportunity CIA – where you don't have to know how to catch the bad guys – GIVEN that obama has ties to known terrorists and he appointed a potentially espionage challenged person to head the CIA – oh this just gets better and better

diarrhea and a bloddy nose – is that what they tried to do to me – mother moved and is speaking.  14:54 EST – suggesting you're right. 

habitat building shoddy houses? - didn't hear about that. 

carter's foreign advisory – from Russia- he won a nobel too didn't he? - like I remember cringing at something he said on the newshour – I didn;t know he advised carter – DURING THE COLD WAR – Carter had someone from the USSR as a foreign polciy advisor - ??? - he may be qualified – that is a wow thing – like I remember a little of the Reagan era – I can;t imagine what is was like in Carter's time – The USSR was the enemy -

went to hannity.com – meant to go to hutchison.senate.gov – and I capitlized most of this line by accident and retyped it – 1/5/09 14:38 Est. 

Selling Cold medicines during winter does make some sense - but we are hainvg quite a few coughing people or sick people by sound in ocmmercials on kfyo - take your temperature-  cough syrup - cough medication - staying awake or fresh breath with smart mouth moutwash -  SNL is now making the commercials on kfyo it would seem - And there is health concern after health concern on kfyo.  14:04 EST 1/5/09

Gaza – you have Justified the Death of Your Children
After looking at Al-Jazeera – where Hamas is saying the justficiation of the deaths of Israeli children is validated -Israel did pick this time to “get peace for its citizens” - - I will be itnerested to see how the “fundamental  situation” changes because of current actions – I wouldthink things will just repeat themselves unless Israel is extremely clever – and I am not usre that will happen – once Hamas is cleared out -won'tit just came back – I already commented that the timing of this as the US government changes – is highyl suspicious – I now udnerstnad 500 people is not even 1% of 400,000 – so someone is at least being somewhat careful – with the atttackers and the situations Israel has – developig – non-lethal means of arresting perpetrators and  capturing them – our governemtn did not look at that carefully – and should have – Israel has much more incentive – yes a teenage Palestinian can kill an Israeli soldier with whatever – do you still want to be the one to explain to his family why their son was killed by grown soldiers? -  So if you could keep them alive and incapacitate them to sort things out – less resentment would be created – I watched as it looked like our military vetoed that idea in favor of lethal technology which of course was only so effective in somalia and in other close combat places where you have to deal with the families of the people you just murdered – there is a time when death is needed – but how much and when are at question and our military basically said – we prefer to kill than th use non-lethal technology it appeared – or I haven't heard a good ocunterargument as to why non-lethal technology has not been developed in 20-30 years?  That is what could be better and I would bet our military isn't the only one who underneath may prefer dead enemies to incapacitated ones.  - I will watch – it's not mine to act – It is Israel's call. 

Rush we've entered the Obama years – your radio show is now edited by Michelle Obama and Bill Ayers.   And you are allowed to say one syllable per hour.

Yes they Can  . . . . . threaten with Caillous

picked at random from first search list-  but not on the initial channel that I used for the other two - “Caillous” goes apple picking – I stayed away from the police officer and the fireman – which obvious bad chocies – this I thought was safe -
I have to go to the bathroom and am fighting that - 
in general  - ground is dirty – apple on ground is dirty it has bugs in it – strawberry shortcake – taking turns – proper sized ladder -  and on the clip I saw – there was a thing on seasons – keeping the garden clean in the spring - - why does the earth need to be clean? - it is dirt - ?   And the reverence for deer – cute animals- having seen wild deer in Pittsburgh they are not always cute they can be frightening – you learn if you watch they are wild and if you are unarmed – keep your distance – those hoove – a frightened animal is not a toy. 
How would that whole segment apply to me – I am that big apple they are trying to pick – pick nbefore it matures and hits the ground and gets bugs in it – the CIA – might be the bugs - - deer – i saw deer many deer in Pittsburgh – big deer hunting place – apples are a favorite treat of deer – deer like to eat apples – then they go into the different way once apples are picked and stopped from growing they can be used for many things – and caillous goes – I like mine all alone – kind of quick and dirty is how we're going to get you  - and the cleaning the garden in the spring reference – Pittsburgh – celaned me out of the city -and at the bar on Atwood Street – nto sure if it was the spring – but could have been  spring of 2005 or summer 2005 – a guy with the clean up Pittsburgh shirt on came by me out of the bar on atwood – and shirts were used for a lot messges.  Game Over  and dead men tell no tales – currently I see no one so I can't see a shirt.  Yes this is the last clip I saw – they can threaten me with caillou and caillou is negative-  the over clean aspect – the happy friendly playground – lady ellaine fairchild has been banished- even Mr Rogers had more evil in his show than this does.  Everyuone is happy and gets along.  From Canada.   I don;t Garfield – and I know he is corrupt too – but garfield had on the budedyt bears – who got along perfectly and they mocked on Garfield-  but he became an environmentalist and not a friend and i know that.  But that one aspect was so bad – The buddy bears looked fake for always getting along.  
Mother introduced me to Garfield. 
So in an instant search this is what I found – first record I didn't try much – they only had 30 seconds
“Garfield and Friends episode Return of the Buddy Bears”
- cleaning the house by getting rid of all the food – stiffing the buddy bears pay – the house is messy from Garfield - - no linking at all to me-  yes     EVERY SINGLE VIDEO i GET ON MY OWN IN YOUTUBE CAN BE MADE HOSTILE – AND WHAT THEY DID A MASSIVE BUYOUT ON ALL d & d AND RELATED STUFF ON AMAZON – BECAUSE ALL THE PRODUCTS I WANT ARE OUT OF STOCK – though it is odd the shipping estimates on what i did order got revised upward.  From the 9th and the 14th to the 20th ordered couple days ago.    None of the items came. 

Other caillous episdoes here :

Dragon tamer episode in caillou – the dragon doesn't have to be bad and mean – kid playing him is older than other kids – well I watched caillou – on youtube – no idea what was going to be on it – it applies directly to me.  - threatened by PBS

Surprise Sleepover – power out on caillou because of rain storm – did someone leave the sprinkler on –  that is not a perfect reference-  but the bus driver I didn't like to state college and others in Pittsburgh – CCAC professor – non-credit business or math – when I would run somewhere and sweat up – they would joke – is it raining outside-  it was a pittsburgh thing to joke like that and the joke in caillou is similar – though that part is not exact – HOWEVER -  there is the rest of show – shadow by a light that the kids think are monsters but it's actually a cat – one cat's are referenced all over in Pittsburgh and even here – once in a while – and the shadow scaring the kid – kid being scared by the shadow a shadow – that was in a commercial earlier-  I did an email title- something like a kid being scared by shadows is called terrorism  - it's a past email – but a while ago – terrorism is in the title - - AND they pitched a tent in their house – I of course lived in a tent for a while in my apartment in Pittsburgh to prevent the spying – I didn't know at that time how it worked – how someone could do that – but pitching a tent like that in the middle of my room is probably an effective way to get rid of many problems – mother has referenced the tent several times in sort of derision – so it was effective.  - Okay that is two for two – they can threaten with caillou – with a random episode of a Pbs show from Canada – shown on youtube – like that is like a triple withcing hour on wallstreet – of course it's going to be threatening -

I had mostly quiet toys growing up – not so many ones that make noises.  - cayu – is not – it is quiet - - I have to watch it again – I was not overly fond – let me see it again.  

glenn has a point that states should have a point to break away from the govt peacefully – in all cases they should and do benefit from the union more than they lose by being part of it.  I do worry now – like who in a state gets to decide to break the union – like the founders did not believe the people should decide- so it is a legitimate question – my faith in the public to vote is a little shaken  -I would want like 2 votes from the public to leave the union a probation and then a final vote and a couple years between them. 

I am not a teacher's union fan- I would have to think a little whether they are more dangerous than organized crime – certainly – education is less affordable – seems to be less efficient – and has progressed less than other areas – and none of that is to their credit -and they did screw up with me too. 

boortz – are u doing praganda for Hamas?

I think it may be an established law of government now – that the faster a spending  bill is passed – the LESS practically the money will be spent by the Government and the MORe money will be in the bill too – how about 2 Trillion dollars in 2 days.  - with this current value in dollar – not a deflated FUTURE dollar amount please – following the 700 buillion bailout we have a trillion – what does this suggest? 

How does poker like provide value to the economy - like it sucks money out of people who otherwise may not give it - that is somewhat practical -

and if you guys don't want me to leave the house until Jan 20th - that is okay with me.

the TRILLION dollar stimulus plan cannot be practically put together in a week – well it's not a practical idea either so that whole thing has a nice cycle together doesn't it?

can pets smoke legal marijuana and walk at the same time in Ca – and I know in CA that case amy come up - the CA governor's office is the only one I know of to have animal issues as a possible topic  - however I don;t deal with NY, WA, or OR much these days - there may be others -

Gambling has downsides – both created jobs are not great – and then you create the MIT people who live to play poker- not a good class to create.

politicians don't like you if they lose and you were loyal to their winning opponent – um I woulldn't anything about that – fundraising for John Kerry and voting for George Bush and being honest about it in the beginning – in 2004 – I know nothing about that – politicians don't seek revenge- what – ya kidding me – nothing that happened to me looks like revenge? -  Are you kddin' me – it all looks normal.  Voted against carry – salray cut to a quarter of former amount -  alright alright. 

odd window popped up while filling in the clintonfounation.org contact form out - talked about a script running and asked me if I wanted to continue it or cancel - I picked cancel and everything was okay - just it was itneresting. 

patches was a famous pet of someone – is it the companion of socks the cat ?  Mother named the cat cabomba – so that is where my fluency with languages may come from – I just thought people gave pets unusal names versus object names. .

burris has to run for reelection in 2 years.

with Chicago you would have to prove intent – and that will be difficult – but yes the system failed and it is “odd”

on the 5th and 14th ammendments - the doctors can force you to pay medical bills - like when you are under court order- they tell you to get medication and by court order you have to get it and in my case pay for it.  And yes that is property or money - i ahve to pay it isn;t in the court truling - the court didn't designate me to pay for medication - it designated doctor treatment - - the doctor then can prescribe whatever he wants - you are saying technically that may be a right violation - in addition they did take property - they - by their actions they did - the hospital and the city - the police did deprive me of property and never reimbursed me for it.   it's been 4 years - - end of 2005 - 3 years.  - the bus ticket that went bad because of forced hospitalization worth $300-400 dollars.  - time expired on it while in hospital.

We keep having references to the “fun” civil war ammendments-  the 14th ammendment is highly interesting – section 3 in particular – could he do that – he could – oh wow – and in a suit in a heartbeat that would flip – things – and it woudl bealmost cooler to announce the count and then invalidate them and elect the other person.  -

I note that the city of Chicago violated my 14th ammendment rights – when it “lost” myy motor voter application and I could not vote in the congressional 1998 election because of it – if I can prove intent and their might be intent – in addition section 1 of the 14th ammendment could be added to my case against Pittsburgh due to forfeited property and infringement of liberty – mother is going nuts downstairs – banging of door and motion – so yes the 14th applies to me in 2 different cases  - plus the federal implications – why am I having visions of like a thermo-nuclear explosion politically hitting the north – the equivalent of that – oh wow.   Not a real bomb – but just – I am getting – they are so far over the line – this still all seems like fiction at this point – it is beyond belief.  But yeah that ammendment applies to – we have 6 ammendments that were broken so far known - 1st , 4th 5th, 6th , and 8th , and now 14th – do I hear 7 ? - coughing badly. 

- I did have problems with icy and blurry windshields in cars in CT and IL – in IL I coudln't see in the sun from the streaks on my windshield at one point-  I remember that day – I was driving and I couldn't see out of the windshield -  that's not a good thing – no it's not – which is why I didn't very much – things would happen  - oh the car the AAA guy – who was russian or slavick by accent and who made getting the jump to move my car a huge problem nearly ran into him which would have been a problem – he was giving me bad instruction – constantly calling me an idiot and it seemed while he was standing behind the car in front of mine – parallel parked on those lovely Chicago streets by lake michcagan about 6000 North of downtown – Bryn Mawr- forehead resting on first two finger joints of right hand -  I thought he was telling me to put my foot on the gas to start the car and take foot off the emergency break and he kept calling me an idiot – this is the triple A person – you know when you can call – how stupid are you any way – and there was a witness family – I just was very careful and I didn't hit him but the family who owned the home was watching and were perfect witnesses – I was set up and “got lucky” - nothing happened – I still felt bad – I could have hurt him – didn;t want to – he put me in a situation by the way he acted with no visible witnesses to help me – where I almost injured him – it would have changed my life – there was no reason he had to stand right in front of my car – but he did – he set up an accident condition.  And yes he was slavick – I said Russian – maybe – could easily have been another slavik – But yes problems witth windshield wiper blades flying off the car – not working properly during heavy CT rainstorms and then during winter.  Frosted windshields in CT definitely a problem – rested forhead on first to finger joints again.  -  I called triple A when my car wouldn't start in Chicago and this is what happened – I never had “good luck” when people looked at my car – except for buying it and my first boss literally took me car shopping to a person he knew.  - not knowing how to use an automatic teller from drive through in a car. 

A colleague of mine in CMU – suction.com – and the indian in my class for two years – tried to get me to apply and go to Cooper Union and go there – in the year off – mother was against it – it sounded neat to me the way my two former classmates presented it -

I am an only child as well. 

craddock in TX did the redistricting – that wasn't the most equitable thing as I know of it. 

can we kick Austin out of Texas – um kinda a national problem right now kids is that too many people want to do that sort of stuff on a national scale.

I am not a good judge with Israel – I gave my theory – I do stick by it – the people of Gaza will remember this for a long time – and will feel – or I would feel less remorse at striking at Israel if I were one of them after an incident like this – isn't that a problem?   Have your really worked fully on methods to abduct or capture the people you deem responsible for the bombing without harming the rest of the population? - These pictures invite world outrage – Israel must know that – like almsot yhou are baiting the world to react – in honesty – like the Us(US) and colombia – when (you) do raids – don't you try to hit hard and fast minimize troop exposure to danger – get the targets quickly versus dragging out a campaign – I do not udnerstand any longer and have to again raise a flag-   What are you doing – besides levelling a city it looks like.  (unless this is the only way). 


from yahoo news
the mastermind of Hamas' takeover of Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, exhorted Palestinians to "crush" Israeli forces and to target Israeli civilians – that an interesting line -

and their rocket attacks concur with that – so the problem is that the leaders are hidden and the civillians are protecting them – would any of the civillians leave with the Israelis- into refugee camps while other business was going on in the city?   To clear the civillians not involved out of the way – or is that too hard to discern – I guess long term – if you are doing this it does make sense to be thorough -  i hope that it achieves the best outcome – again I think that if you did that to me – if you bombed me and forcibly took away the people i elected – maybe the election was done through terror – but that would encourage resentment that would not go away.   Do you have a second part after clearing out the people who may well just want to kill Israelis ?   Scratching back of head with right hand – you did say a permanent change in the situation.

60 Minutes – the wire for my keyboard is loose – I should have a still working spare and this one still works – yes if the keyboard shut down that would be problematic and that would potentially shut me off the computer – it is “odd” how the wire got loose and usually things can be handled one or another as they were with the TV – itching – left fingers or right top forearm and right fingers on left bottom writst and coughing with a little phlegm as I write this up  -need to put a blanket on my shoulders for warmth – I was feeling aversion to writing this up – it is going now – maybe I'- no prediction

Rooney – said ABSOLUTELY nothing directly that was significant to current time – my old license pla from Chicago – someone may have that maybe I do.   Licking upper lip there – worry about the power shutting down to the keyboard in which case I won't be able to write anything that can be placed in the computer – neat trick – the lights do blink – num lock, caps lock and scroll lock as a group more often than I wold like – happened since last night when I dropped the keyboard about 2 inches. 

Anyrate – NY Prosecutor “deterring” drunk driving off roads by convicting drunk drivers with murder – this is a highly troubling story – and it is perhaps not as simple as it seems – the rammifications are not so simple – I want at first to jump to the defense of the drunk driver – but as I cough up a little phlegm – here's the thing on this – I do not like what the prosecutor is saying and I do not like the families attitude – bury him under the court – very vengeful – and someone would laugh at my reaction if it were drawn just on that – Someone is cackling somewhere – because they win either way -

Drunk driving can be used as a way to murder someone – and that is the point – BUT certain people are saying if you treat drunk driving as murder which it can be – we can convict fiarly innocent kids for a long time.   And neither scenario will be a good one – you can't win – be just. 

These are the two cases

A person was induced by friends to drink – he or she wasn'tr thinking – they lost control of the vehicle – and they got in an accident and killed several people in the car.   It was not intentional. 

In the other case – a person is told to murder someone or somehow is supposed or induced to murder someone in a car accident – the person intentionally smashes up the car into another person and was drinking enough to cover up the fact that they did intend to kill people with their car. 

In the cases CBS shown – it may be the that the more innocent man is going away for a long term jail sentence and the more guilty people are getting much lighter sentences  - a 2 tiered justice system if ever there was one.  

This may turn into a bland comment-  one has to know the driver intent – to knwo if the crime should be charged one way or the other-  in the NY case – you had an older driver with slower reaction time in the ohter case-  you had the child - - you had things set up well -  and yes it looks like someone inteneds to use drunk driving to remove men from society and possibly women – but men may drink more – be expected to drink in more situations – I don;t know the stats – but i suspect like in my day more men than women drink – I don;t know if women have caught men for drunk driving – But the issues is – drunk driving is a mixed bag and the forces can use any ruling on drunk driving anyway they want to – unless . . . .. intent can be determined – which in honesty even right now I bet it can – but not in a way that is admissable in court – but with determining intent you know who deserves 18 years and who deserves 3 years and one year.   La and NY both seem to have prosecuted cases incorrectly  or may be doing the wrong thing – the more innocent got perhaps the higher conviction and the more guilty the lesser one.   Which may be in the interest of certain forces.   I wonder how much control a gremlin has with you fi you are drunk?   

I am fairly certain that a prosecutor talking to kids will do little-  other adults behind the scenes teach the children to pressure them to drink – it was done to me several times in college-  even by my supposed best friend who on Atwood Street one night told me I couldn't let go enough to get drunk and didn't have enough courage to get drunk – that it recquired courage to get drunk and just like Europe where I needed my mother to come along – he always made a big deal about that – I was too frightened of the consequences to get drunk and in those years maybe post CMU years like 2000ish – when I just moved back to the city.  That argument almost made sense to me – it bristled me quite a bit – today I would find it utterly insane with a few more years under my belt – but even at 26 I did wonder a little if he was right.  I didn;t however get drunk to find out thankfully.   I did drink wine at that point once in a while – it's something you can do as an adult and it felt kind of stupid to always walk past the liquor store and never go in – it is right one my street next to the bar on my street as well  - owner of the bar changes, but it's always a bar-  that does remind me – my Vegas classmate got me to go into that sandwhich shop that probably has flipped as it does every so many years – but he got me to go in there when it first opened and meet the owner – and I wouldn't have ordered there without him “meniktoning” it to me – and I didn't like – food was fine – it was expensive.   I guess precisely which restaurants you eat in says a lot about you too.  But peer pressure does a lot to get people to drunk – I know with drugs – a professor bascially endorsed it by being there – and also smoking – it was hard to say in the house the first thanksgiving – second one – with brownies – funny brownies – I didn't know they were going to do that.  Like there were so many times peers offered me drugs when I look back and I said no without thinking about it a lot.   Like this prosecutor – we have drugs in our society somehow and like that couldn't happen if some adults somewhere were not pushing it – again I think left alone people would not get addicted drugs in most cases – with just a little information and no peer pressure I don't think people would get onto drugs.   But there is peer pressure and there are adults behind the scenes using closet marketing or mouth to mouth marketing to push drugs – and that is the big problem – oddly the drug dealers do not set up lectures to advocate for drugs – and they probably could if they wanted to somehow – but I bet they get it that that format is not as effective as peer to peer marketing at pushing drugs-  it was a Conservative Christian trying to get me to drink by the way -  I do find that HIGHLY ironic. 


Mind reading – it has been done for quite a well – but we are talking about CMU – and trusting the wizards of CMU – DON'T – at least not at first – while brain patterns may be critical – I see a flaw in the study – but the premise can brain patterns be read – from my experience it certainly appears so – so the premise is not fully flawed – there must be readable patterns in the brain that other humans and maybe others can read -  machines? -  brain reading reminds me of genealogy and like those palces who say they can trace your roots.  And ith as some of the same issues – do they know precisely what is going on or just a facsimile of what is going on.  They were helpful – to me – I was in a study much like theirs at Pitt in like 2003 – there was a MRI of my brain – well before the one I had for schizophrenia in 2005 – like in 2002 or 2003 – there was a study and they asked me to have my brain scanned as I was doing tests like looking at pictures and stuff – but the machiens didn't function properly after the first part of the test – the computer images didn't come up – and the person – female – dark hair – did not want me back on another day to get a good clean trial – the data was wasted – because half of the test could not be conducted do to comuter malfuncitons – like I did the first part of the test and then second invovled using this glove to highlight the image described or something  - you had like an A- B – C type choice-  but my name would not be officially in the study – because my data was thrown out – yet I did get paid for being in it part of the fee.   It was around the start of DAM that I did that – MRI studies pay much better than regular psychology studes – though now like all psych0ology studies in my case certainly it does appear to be fool's gold.   All I knew is it was a research study and I trusted that it was benign -  while we're on pitt- another little link to the wondrous apaprently bush disliking – school pyschologist at CCAC – in one of our last meetings pre-mental hospital indcution – we were talkign about medication – he used the phrase won't you try a little bit – and oddly the female doctor in the emergency room who screened me – on Dec 23 2005 – used the same phrase – won;t you try a little bit – when referring to anti-psychotic drugs- in the psychologists ofice I said no – in the emergency room – I did not say not – and I said maybe and maybe even yes – because of the pressure of  being forced in there.   But it links them – that precise phrase only came up in those two places and it was odd how the emergency doctor – that female – reminded me of Jessica Lynch – from DAM – odd thing there.  Just a coincidence. 

But now maybe that I have shown how CMU helped me – perhaps I should help CMU – I am scared of these guys – Do they encourage the thought of window from the same picture-  because they said they generically know the brain pattern of window thought – what parts of the brain a person will use for window for any person – yet they haven't tried every stimulus or even a corpus of stimuli to indcue the thought of window – touching a window in a natural setting  may send a very different brain signal than the black and white image of window used – do different pictures of window have the same brain location – the word window – hearing it – hearing the sound of a double hung window being shut – they ahve those in Pittsburgh – mother got awning windows in this house oddly which the hurricane shutters on the top floor block from opening because of the low ceilings – 8 foot versus the builder wanted 9 foot – that does not seem to be accidental.  - but the good people at CMU – should not say they know a generic pattern of thought – their data is too preliminary – with just using the same picture.    Their time horizon is very optimistic for a machine that can fully read someone's mind – I can be wrong – but no one who is deceiving the machine – not a test where subject  can think about any object from any reference they have at least as a grounding should be there – the technology will not be 100% accurate from what they have shown – or that iws not proven and I worry about using that as court evidence for a while – I think it might be like cancer drugs.   We'll see a few of them come and go.    CMU is getting more corrupt – or corrupted by powerful money – it was while  I was there – odd to have CMU and Texas Tech together in 60 minutes.  - Rubbing back neck after touch by both eyes – index knuckle bottom to right cheekbone top and index finger to left, left eye edge and palm on neck all with right hand 

Texas Tech Football – fairy tale brings NFL money and influence – I don't want to talk about the Texas Tech football team – I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons - - oh my keyboard just blinked – ho oho – but I guess we are switching things a bit – Okay with that done let's talk D &D – The Zhentarim are presented i nthe way Dugneons and Dragons presents evil where for the most part the villain just wants to eventually get you onto a torture wrack and take al lyour magical items – but the Zhentarim in the Forgotten Realms setting do build a network of spies in smaller towns like Shadodale – home of Elminster the Seer – the most pwoerful I think mage in Faerun as Forgotten Realms is called-  Elminster moves to Faerun(Shadowdale) after many adventures he isn't born there – it isn't the size of Saerloon i nthe summer which if I remeber reaches over 200,000 but defintiely not quite 300,000 just yet – Saerloon is something like that in its prime seasons.  But we are talking about shadowdale and the zhentarim like having a network of spies but being in dungeons and dragons they're evil and pose as shady merchants, only occassionally do you see villain in D &D get real villain smarts and like totally infiltrate a good com munity posing as something they're not – polymorph others spells and many to later one's appearance do exist And definitely in Zhentil keep in one time period 2 Devils pose as a ruling couple of humans and no one knows their disguise within Zhentil Kepp for a long time.   - Coughing as I write that-  nearly lopped off my right big toe toenail with my left heel  pushing up on nail as I crossed my feet.   Gelatine from gummy bears does get your toenails to grow doesn't it Haven't had to clip them in months.  What did mother give me oh -  and she bought precisely two boxes of gelatine – jello – that is the other reason forsmall amounts of food – she controls dosages of nturients like medicine – rubbing left side of face with left hand as I write that and hir cheeck with palm and top of head left side in hair with fingers.  Wasn't an even rub.   Oh this is such a good horror movie.   Dropped this keyboard a little – common theme that – gget distracted for a minute – thinking about buying used versus buying new stuff at amazon and high school and looking up one of the people from elementary school yesterday online like I did antoher classmate – get into loop of thought – get out of it and rub left corner of motuh with left thubm – pass gas as I write that up  -touched thumbs as I identified ti as a loop of thought – but Zhentil keep is not like Sauron in the second age – where he comes as the bearer of gifts and good tidings and comes into the isle of Numenor as a fair person and only slowly corrupts them – this is before the war of the ring series by a thousand years or so – Second age – war of the ring ends the third age.  Mother is up 6:31 EST can hear her moving downstairs.  Biting into hand another pimple or small scab on hand – whitehead on my right thigh last night – they had mostly healed for a while – back to story -  there aren't many athletic contests within Dungeons and Dragons – jousting is mentioned in the C – it'sbeing blocked – before Imortals and Master  -but after Basic and Expert – I want to say Companion – that's not it – it is Companion – in the Companion series  they do talk of jousting and hosting a jjousting tournament as a noble lord – and rules on that.  Rubbed all around head as I began to suspcet that ti was companion - - nwo a yawn – they do nto want me to write this one – it is funny to watch this – and not so funny – but In Dungeons and Dragons at least in the rule book one doesn't getting into how to maximize revenue from a joust very much – of course in the model given – the lord or owner pays for the peasants to come to the joust and ti is  means to keep them happy – no lord invented the idea of makiing the peasants pay for their own holiday.  And yes agian no one thought of how to maximize revenue or attendance and interest in a jousting tourfnament in Dungoens and Dragons – it just isn't that important to other goals of the companion set such as the eventually goal of some charctgers to battle with the monsters in the world or other issues – jousting is far down the list much of the time.  We probably don't get into the idea of fairytale jousting tournaments and their imapct on peasant interest in jousting because of course dungeons and dragons si a fairy tale and the idea of the little prince being crowned king is quite easy to produce in dungeons and dragons and doesn't have to be faked and managed to happen – it happens all the time – in fact is boring and we moved on to crowinging the dark elf rebel as a noble above ground..  
That was one thing I wanted to get into – antoher – ya know when looking over Palladium and Rolemaster or middle earth both of which use the same gaming system – from Iron Crown Enterprises – one would wonder why the company is named after the Iron Crown of Morgoth – details details – but all three of those games have like 8 to ten attributes to describe a cahracters basic abilities unlike dungeons and dragons which has 6 – and therein actually USED to lie its beauty – it relatively simple game mechanics and then too many physicist and experts on hand to hand combat got together and now  apaprently in the 3rd edition there was a rules compendium put togehter just for the different – AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH – and it won appeal originally on its simplicity even if its depictions of combat weren't perfectly realistic – your fighter can take more damage than four warhorses – really ?  - but I digress – attributes I was focusing on attributes six attributes of dungeons and dragons – in particular things have shifted over the years – but I didn't want to get into the full history – instead – in Dungeons and Dragons when evaluating a person's mental abilities – the psionicist for example – intelligence over the ability to analyze data quickly is not just one stat – or being intelligent is not just one stat – it is actually 2 if not 3 stats – maybe even 4.   There is of course Intelligences which would be the stat that would be used in analyzing and calculating so many calcualtions per second or seeing a pattern and the raw recognition of a pattern or the many movements and getting to a pattern that would be under the attribute of intelligence – what used to be and still the traditional needed stat to be a wizard – of course in the third they introduced sorcerers who cast wizard spells but usede Charisma as the prime stat for their power and not intelligence or raw number crunching.  Charisma has changed over the years as it is hard to define – my definition currently may not fully match the games either – it used to sort of be good looks – it is definitely at first the characteristic a football coach would possess that drive and passion that can be used to sway the audience – but in current editions it has changed – and in 3rd edition I think – Charisma became more like Wisdom used to be and the drive the force of will – that became part of charisma's protfolio as an attribute – which is not there in the 1st edition – but it is there now and having a high Charisma is necessary to being a sorcerer.  Many sorcerers in the game tend to be loners it is noted here.  And the last definite mental trait of dungeons and dragons is wisdom used for clerics or priests – but wisdom is the ability stil lto see rammifications of actions and make good decisions based on the information one concludes – it is one thing to use Intelligence to analyze a situation quickly and rapidly and reach the right understanding of the plaiyng field – it is another thing to have the wisdom to take the right actions – many spell casters have higher mental attributes in all mental categories than physical – admittedly a high dexterity is useful for spellcasters to be able to duck out of the way when objects get thrown at them - - that did happen at nights as a freshman and sophomore at CMU when random people threw things at me as I ran on the track of Gesling stadium.  - just a remembrance – they did it fro mtheir dorm windows I think and I could not tell who was doing it – it made me move somewhere else to run.  Rubbed left cheekbone with right index finger.   - but to finish off – Being rated high mentally as a character in dungeons and dragons involves not only a high intelligence – but also wisdom and charisma  and one last score score also comes into play – Constitution – the ability to endure physical pain – and it was implied in older version that Constitution also was about enduring mental pain – I am thinking that should be Charisma to balance things out and make more sense.  Just checked it is in the 4th edition.  And the point kiind of was to push it out a bit – Some people can be very good in their analytic capabilities and lack wisdom to draw the right conclusions or the Charisma to challenge the status quo.  As I said earlier – I normally played a Wizard in the old game and now i would switch to Sorcerer.

son to inauguration – leadership thing – I was in a leadership meetings at CCAC – best way to bring country together is to sue rick Warren – BUT  IT IS NOT BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER – EVANGELICALS LIKE IT – BUT THE GAY COMMUNITY DOESN'T AND IT IS HIGHLY ODD OBAMA DID NOT SPOT THAT WEDGING – IT IS SEPARATING THE COUTNRY ON AN ISSUE VERSUS UNITING IT – AN ODD THING FOR A EEOC PRESIDENT ELECT TO DO

catholic – not as christian I guess-  that was used in CMU – freshman – Gary would say catholics aren't Christians – to me – freeshman and sophomore year-  caller knows that somehow -

my god isn't exclusionary – but I don;t call him that- you miss that aprt – and I want the ceremony the way I beleive and with my worship practices and to exclude yours  -which is what you want-  why do you win? - that gets to be the issue – we use a way during the ceremony – so you pick one as favorite

name dropping duncan hunter – benediction does not mean warren is in Obama's camp -   Jesus and his disciples only went where wantred- doesn't relate in truth -

keyboard wire loose turning off power to    keyboard   - the lights on the left(right)  blinking off and on- on occassion – num lock – caps lock etc – odd that should happen - 


rubbed around head before sending this with right hand 19:49 ESt 1/4/09 – on yahoo mail.

Obama elected presidnet – actually not yet – Jan 9th – the electors come out – in addition if he is an illegal immigrant – if he has criminal acts – the election will not be the deciding thing and I thinki both of those statements are ture.  -  

fried chicken is not fundamental issues-  if we are one country we should get down to one set of fudnamental values-  there are some things that are left grey-  not certain thigns- we ahd a discussion about that in 1860 – and everyone doesn't get that -  and you should have an opinion on your country – this idea – it's not important – it is the country – those couple thoughts are what do and what should bind us – the rest is individual -  and this southern bullshit idea of disagreeing without beign disagreeable – that is southern – northerners – USED to argue like hell even strangers and you don't get shot – that is the north – I know from DAM when I did UNCT TV – fundraising – the souterners have this no talking thing – don't say something to upset- no instead you have a civil war-  that is what happens when you don't force out things that need to be said-  the south is wrong on that – argue with each other to acheive solidarity – the south is wrong on being pleasant when you actually disagree – it doesn't work – and makes a weaker country.

Jay- I think =- how are u – saying positive – for gays – but no problem with pastors at inauguration  - not necessarily intolerance -  it's overestimating the importance of this – it says a lot about application of constitution -  you don't seem to want me to write anymore allen – so I won't – this guy is clever – several things I could write – but same as others

Eric – if I were gay I'd be happy – missed that till allen says it – are u born atheist – wow  - you're not  born a christian

Rick O'warren

so it was gremlins in my tummy – ho ho

rubbed right ear as I get ready for allen -

hullabaloo

*
Bill Richardson is under investigation – but not Obama – that is pretty odd – and it sounds weird – meaning – is their an alterior motive. 
*

Mike – advice – people should pay attention to what matter in their lives and not butt in to other people's life-  worry about bread instead of free speech – and no Idon;t agree – you can;t walk over me and get me to worry about my stomach – cancer or being full.    I did miss the last point – 2 men getting married is not a basic block  of society – he slipped another one in – they are trying a new style to slip stuff under4 the radar that sounds more natural..    The other style was too easy to catch.,   - marriage is a legal contract though – he held his points until I started typing – we will catch them. 

look younger for $ 19.95 – doesn't anyonwe sell anything to make you look older allen – I am gboing for hte Ogra look form the dark crystal right now. 

Gay people can be for gay lifestyle-  caller  can speak out against it-  but do gay people get ssame rights – that is where the line is – do you recognize that?  - radical gays better watch – get straight community upset – so the radical gays better watch what they say – ah that pesky 1st ammendment is being burned and I am wlaking into a trap – just like the second phrase in this paragraph – all rights should be taken with good ethics – which gets rid of inappropriate outbursts – where there are some – the law handles them and not other people “deciding” soemthing should not go on – that idea is what is a problem – that you can decide what is inappropriate for your neighbor without going through recongized channels -  people don't think the legal thing applies jsut lena on your neighbor until they get the message and that is illegal – but it is done. 

Jake – Obama's choice- we elected him to be our leader not our puppet-  manchuria candidate -

Oprah can't get a ticket to the inauguration?????? - wow

couldn't find a person everyone would agree with – I bet you could – some english commentator-  not Brit – writer – Oprah would be a good choice for pastor for the nation – bill cosby -

Rick warren – brin civility – sounds li9ke Obama – is it at gunpoint we have civility -the ministry of peace in babylon 5?

at the inauguration – for preachers okay – giving inaugural portions – no

I am not a conservative or liberal – follower of christ – that is total BULLSHIT allen – you ahve poltiical opinions-  people of faith do by default IF they believe their faith – do not try that – I don;t care line- you could be a moderate on every issue-  but you're not on gay marriage – you have opinions – not poltical – is a lie-  everyone has opinions – most won;t be honest- it is costly and sometiems hard to be honest. 

- what if he chose jeremiah right -  happny new year – Democrats and republcians cut from same cloth – soem dems and Rs – not cut some – extreme right wing view ridiculous-  Rick warren isn't honest

Scott – missed name – baptist guy – just espouting – jealous pf Rcik warren – H jealous of preacher – I think preachers may be calling a spade a spade

– Obama frightens people because he is unknown - unknown frightens people – I have information – some things in Bush – things that people can never know about in this coutnry – caller is coutnry dropping – H curl your nose hair – I do have nose hair problems - - saying I will never be known

why can't people jsut get along – greed – or simply there are cookies to fight over and people still look at eating cookies instead of planting them and getting a cookie tree as a better deal. 

mistype Firefox can't find the server at www..allenhuntshow.com.- 18:47 EST 1/4/09 – passe gas as I reported this. 

another tin from the same company from mother when I mentioned them – my stomach is upset again – though no other affects yet. 

Kim -  prayer – is about Obama – not really about coutnry-  say what??? - get beyond your own agenda as a person – um so lie essentially – form of idoltry to have own opinion -  H – like princess of the pea – Victor Funderburk where are ya – yes she is antoher “funny” caller- caller-  she has gay friends last gay calel4r had Christian friends – odd all that -

itched privates as I emailed Ron Paul – 8:43 – and passed gas in last 2 minutes – didn't catch it

american who happens to be gay – not important the pastor- she is lying or not real – and she emphasized Bush thrown out – she is a palnt – not authentic at least.   18:42 Est – Janet

it is odd Obama could not have pciked someone more palatable to the gay community for the inaugural when you put it that way – I hand't thought about it. 

ahteists at 2% - that community is growing very quickly – then – 1.4% in 2001 non-denominational – atheists and everyone else.. 

Freedom should be more important than bread in a better world – it is not a better world and bread is more important than freedom -

separate but equal wasn't that decided in board of education ? - that is the issue with legal marriage – marriage is being redefined legally not in a religious sense and the religions do not hold sway legally.  The legal definition of marriage should comply with other laws of the country and not discriminate. 

Obama – we're not going to agree on every single issue – disagree without being disagreeable – um during the Bush years – his detractors were not disagreeable while disagreeing – get the conservative talk show host reeducation center ready and I will be put on Risperdal -  you cannot really disagree without being disagreeable – you won;t be honest- midwesterners aren't – they made Barack Obama – and that is not a good thing – complete fiction -  the midwestern way – it's flaw are on display right now. 

should preachers be at a presidential ceremony – no – not really – should be a judge – not at the oath or  whatever – it is more Christian than not – reflective moment perhaps

Wesley sleep program – autistic son iwth medication – oh yes you are in the mark levin commercial traditon – I see – kfyo 18:19 Est

It is important for America to come together – Backy – that is the line that scares me – with him that means – you may disagree with me – I ma holding a gun to your head buddy – come together with me and work with me or else – that is what I think that line literally means-  when I president – no dissent  -

gravitas issues Allen – that's not what you mean right? - every single perosn has had prayer – um as the first president Barack Obama would not even be able to vote for the first person – should we get voer that? - it's not the same issue – it is an issue there is some legitimacy- it is being turned into a political football and being used to divide the country and it need not be – and that is regrettable. 

I forgot Rex -

and a little spider came down from the ceiling as I wrote the section below – spinning a line down between me and my computer – very small spider.   - the psider on my screen twice with Senator Warner – a year ago or more now. 

from movie critic to music video critic -
I guess I will say this it does apply to both groups that I saw – maybe a group and a person – I made the  comment on using a video to tell a story – music video to tell a story – there is some difference between what both of you are doing and what the groups I named are doing – there videos are “tighter” - the graphic story being told takes precedence over the performance – NOW IT IS COMMON WITH LOGICAL COHERENCY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE A PERFORMANCE COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE STORY LINE IN THE VIDEO AND THE GROUPS WHO ARE GOOD DO THAT – “they give you hell, hope it gives you hell”  – they perform when they are artists in the video – logical placement – it's sort of like product placement but you are placing yourself-  but it is done in character -  other groups like to have the performance throughout, but not in places where it fully lends itself to the story they are trying to tell on the video  – in a recent video and in this group's case – the themes in the videos are getting stronger – the story is stronger as the group gets older-  shall we say it's not the worst thing to have  that happen – but if I compare you on that idea – of STICKING TO THE SCRIPT – you have lines in your song – that don't directly reference graphically in the video – if you talk abou all this stuff in a mall – that feeling of all this stuff should carry on the video and in that place it gets abstracted and is a weak reference – if one of the singers is singing the part about a character at the mall – but she is performing and acting like a musical performer when that is not what she is singing about – that is logically inconsistent – that is another issue – IF you want to do this or want a video structured this way – when you jump it has to be logical – We didn;t start the fire has 4-5 different sets – jumps many times – and to a coffin – the jumps are very carefully thought out and I bet if I look referenced to song breaks – others like weird spacey shots in the middle of meaningful lines- and start off a theme of being a food court – and there is a mugging or theft – but it isn't perfectly clear what is going and then it jumps out of that scene – make the point and THEN jump out – and like if you built in – on the strong end theme of the song – sort of mall excess-  you build in vignettes in the mall excesses-  it can be corny and fun and zany it just has to aid the punchline which there is one at the end – but not all of what is shown up to that aids in building to that punchline -  like put the space stuff on the TV screen in the mall or maybe some fountain or display piece – the zany stuff could even be a cue at the end of each scene – it doesn't have to be disappear – just be placed and located better and look like you control the script versus pieces seem uncontrolled – that is the main difference – that and you jump in such a way that the story line can;t fully logically function and the ones I mention before do not do that.  And you can do wacky stuff like ride a bike through the mall – but what happens around the bike and and where the bike goes should relate to the song and what is being sung – it only loosely does that. 

– that is the idea-  you also put in pieces of you just singing when it's not chorus and they are substantive lines – description in the song – which disrupts continuity in getting into a story  If you want a tighter video – you may not – you like sort of zany theme where it doesn' fully come together

  - Someone else was trying to do that with a ship and a movie  – If that is your point – –– If you do want a video more to the story of the song versus an outtake of a performance - when you sing in the video it has to make sense in the story –you sing in a separate shot from the clips of the movie -  if you are sang to the lover on the side in certain places while the action is moving but the romantic male lead is doing something – like you are singing to him as he is in a picture frame moving through action and then the scene changes  - that would work and the singer is the narrator  your song sort of lends itself to you being a narrator and a moment maybe frozen or minimized again in a picture frame on screen while the words and the singer become prominent and then scene change and story is full – singer is hidden – it's that type of song and lends itself to that.  Versus the jar of one moment story and the next singer – they are two separate worlds – never mixed at all and it's a video – they should be intertwined.  Liked that movie and I liked the song above. 
For the song above before that – you could have security cams in the mall as the scene changer like end each mini-scene with like the eye of a security cam and go into it for the next scene – or use that for one scene – a Tv for another one – like that – where does the wackiness come from – and both of those could be somewhat logical places.  Like on pleasure seeker – at a cosmetics booth with free samples – at the food court getting free samples-  in a mirror trying on dresses or whatever else – using different things sold at the mall – one cool way – start with one and like put it in a video lense and like add one lense and then add 2 lense – each lense the same singer but seeking pleasure in a different way and at end of that section zoom into new lense and new part of the mall and start next scene.   - for singing the video – Tv screens music covers – even a digital picture frame or a computer laptop these days.  Or soemthing odder like the crystal ball of a fortune teller or maybe in one of the gumball machines.  - just soem thoughts cheers. 


there was an ad on hulu.co m for a website on education – not council ad2go.comm – that is not perfect – ti was like a gladitorial arena – but with people representing subjects and one even had equations on his body – pitting knowledge as sort of fighting for knowledge – but sort of a takeoff on the advice I gave on learning lessons from rock videos and applying it to education – of course this was not truly done with intent – just a commercial that seems to be a takeoff on something I said a day ago on hulu..com today 1/4/09 – that stuff happens so often I stop recording it – they had skeletons of a pair of gladiators at one point for like biology.  - but again not truly to educate – and an ad for a website – ho ho.  + - passed gas while writing this. 

accidentally put the email list #5 on boortz.com – forgot what was on clipboard – had dinner – ro brought up dinner to have – and that assisted my forgetfulness – rubbed back right side with right thumb and the did something else as I wrote this up.  16:27EST 1/4/09

part of the yahoo page did not load up the first time – the yahoo mail page cut off loading and did not load backround - - the news – the final links were not loaded in and I could not use it until I hit refresh – which might tag that it's me- I had to hit an extra button I normally wouldn't – I watch those – I have too many golbins and gremlins lurking around me – the one downstaris is the first  - 16:04 EST 1/4/09 – did I ever mention what a surreal and bizarre existence this is.   - someone is pointing out to me I might want to remember the headmaster of a high school and his ethnicity – true-  things we're still funny in elementary school – why was I friends with a certain person and then the negative incident – in that wondrous pattern – 2 of those in primary school – in addition the third who hung around mom – not the kid – the mother – less contact with them -  that was and now looks “funny” - and in high school – the car accident – and the touching a few people I normally would not contact.  And I mentioned other incidents in high school – there is  a funny pattern – not as funny as with another group and yes more anomaleis where things did not go wrong – BUT – it is there – both high school and primary school contain - “funny” incidents – where I now go – how the hell or heck did that happen when I look at it – isn;t that kinda odd?

A New Competitor for Pat Robertson – an Alternative Energy Televangelist Polar Bear coming to Congress soon. 
Hamster sense is going off at oil – Please tell me why the following scenario cannot happen -
Currently OPEC is cutting production AND Democratic leaning states are putting new taxes on gasoline because of low oil price.   - It appeared that the price in oil dropped really fast not jsut perhaps because of slowdown in market activity and in honesty unemployment MAY hit 7% - but that means 93% of people are working – NEEDING FUEL – yet the price of gas if under half – there was some talk that oil contracts were bought and sold to flood the market -   THE CHEAP  OIL IS ALLOWING A fuel GAS TAX APPLICATION -  versus natural gas – the rascals are still trying to drive that up – givng the political environment of the US – it would be a logical move to apply gas taxes now – and then as OPEC cuts production – buy tons of oil contracts – jack the hell out of the oil price again – ship in a polar bear or two to congress – whine global and preach alternative energy policy – the “evil” Arab nations will have raised the price of oil and gas and it will be there fault because they cut production when the oil price shoots sky high again when those wascally – or rascally – investors buy up the oil contracts and cause that too happen – the Democratic states who applied gas taxes will make a fortune in revenue temporarily to set off other revenue sources from decreasing -  AND – the polar bear comes in – A talking polar bear from Canada who preaches in Southern Baptist Televangelist on the virtues of  Alternative Energy – in Congress – I can see it now

My Brother and Sister Humans and Animals-  god has punished for our sins of using the earth and about our mother planet and he has righteously struck us down with the high heat of global warming as spoken in Absolutely and Expertly truthful movie of “An Inconvenient Truth” - My friends save yourselves and your brother animals by passin' mutli-Trillion dolalr legislation to combat global warming and stop diggin' in the foul center of the earth which is known to be the domain of Satan for that evil oil which is black – and turn to clean, efficient, low cost, and repair free alternative energy – even if we have to put extra mirrors on Mars and Jupiter to getas much as we did from fossil fuels friends, Lord knows it is worth it – Can ya hear the Lord Telling you to Vote for solar Panels and Wind Farms and the several hundred billion or more in Infrastructure costs today friends.  Can ya hear it Now – Can you hear the Lord – Praise the father – Amen to the Father – Amen to alternative energy – Amen – Amen -  and you can help to by writing hefty to checks to the nice people that support me and efforts to convince people of the righteousness of Alternative Energy for there are many sinners just yet still using gas powered lawn mowevers.  Through out your gas guzzlers today and switch to electric alternative enrgy lawn mowevers – and mail the checks 2009comingoftheecofreeakstoDC.org

Drilling in Utah – robert Redford  - Once you've destroyed the land it's gone – of course if you know geology – all of the earth's crust eventually does change into lava over time and is thorough recycled – no land does stay solvent(solid, cute I put down solvent – didn't mean too ) - it take millions of years – but land does not stay pristine – that ain;t hwo the earth works, and over time forests turn to desert many changes happen – and that can take 10,000 years – so really don't get the whole environmental persecptive from actors with a political agenda – rule one-   Sarah Palin next to that pipeline in AK on ABC news-  we don't see shots of that when we talk about enviro-impact- odd that – we hear Robert Redford instead – hmmm.   Not much data on impact either – just fear and terror in emotional activist speakers – no wodner people think environmentalists are nuts – that met the nuts first and never met an environmentalist who was sincere.  And Redford in the next clip does go on to say billion fo years land will be there-  that is wrong – first weathering – it will not be the same land over billions of years by that alone – but again see again over I think it is millions of years for it to LITERALLY not be land but be lava – it may well be 200 million years or more-  BUT – in 10,000 year the character of the land will change significantly – cna change completely for like redwood old growth forest to desert and that is a natural change – os even if it is the same land – it becomes a desert instead of a redwood forest – I would try to look up the geologic inforrmation online  I bet it has been delted or I will have a difficult time finding it now.  I have discussed the dellusion of green energy and the equally deluded souls – one bine Tom Daschel the new health adminstrator isn't it who stands to profit from alternative fuels over oil – these deluded souls who support green technology and “forget” to mention that their stock portfolio or equivalent depends upon it. 

It took the SEC 10 years to do Madoff – they had evidence for 10 years – so what I've got about 6 years left – I see.   Not surprised at this point. 





CBS – Shawano WI – hit men for entire town or 60 public officials – Canadian who mentions he has an Italian connection and thus the mofia – and one other things bothered me – they are trying to get better at taking away initial thoughts and mother is doing that more often – hired to kill politicians in a small town – mayor had to stop her open door policy – no – trying to find the other one -they are trying to get expert on taking one thing away from me when I am writing down and they-  did like I got the nudge to write this up write now and not watch other stories – they are testing how well they can make forget a response within in a minute – which was used in court before-  where I couldn;t remember a key point at trial – that I wanted to counter of the doctors.   They are practicing so they always get it right – they get in the ehtnic thing which is from recent and they got in one other thing that is from recent writing - - AH – I got it back – the journalist was the source of evil in the piece – he was a very evil person for what he said the two guys on the street- they were blocking that from me and I got it back – 15:12 EST – 1/4/09 – they are getting an AWFUL lot of practice on me – that is a bad thing and I guess it is nice not to be in court too – but they are trying to focus on making me forget every time – and here it looks like I remembered.   CBS is a communist organization – it is the representative of the group who may have hired the hitman saying that-  that some people think CBS is a communist organization – but it got in the piece – in addition – this was initially the only clip I could see – other than the full news – I talked about how for some reason the window was small – oddly – it is usually larger – so someone gamed it so I see this – I foudn the solution – before I saw this – but looked anyway.  - next – mother just came up after I finished this by 30 seconds – mentioned mice-  she has threatened that with the food here if – it stays in here – I will get a mouse – which happened in Pittsburgh twice.    We'll see. 

cbs seems to have forgotten the scroll bar on its video page – just a coincidence – not a coincidence – well – other associated videos have cropped up that have been helpful and me not seeing any but two of the available videos there unless I am does help prevent that from happening. 

See we scored another shot – cloning is evil – instead of introducing clones – you'll starve half of Africa and South America to death with your solution – I would take gladly “the madness” of cloning anyday – idiocracy.  - yu aren't – I know Japan said coopt the friendly videos – remember that segment like a month ago and they have tried to do it on youtube – and I did rub my face when I said cloning isn't a big deal and it isn't or at least it's not what some religious in the US make it out to be – I did get into a discussion about cloning with the recruiter in 2004 – in Oakland – a brief comment – and he was disapproving – but I defeated his argument – the religious hang up of the military and others with its draw backs – like I will remember to envision the mayan ruler cutting his penis to feed the sungod when I think of your hangups with me in the future – I do feel it comes VERY close to being that stupid.  - next – you left the point to the end though – on hulu.com – good strategy – for various reasons I was sort of prepared for it to go that way.  Clones of the future perhaps “replacing” in time the current ones who like different, but think and act the same way – cuase obviously looking the same but being your own person is far worse than looking different but being compelled and acting the same – I am pretty sure the latter would doom society faster.   The first scenario might actually get the idea to vary the DNA in their place of residence every once in a while – the second gorup won;t.  Scratching left and right sides of face with respective hands and top of head iwth left hand.    I do get that you are chilling and heating my room – or I did suspect that.   - Itching right knee with right fingers.    Last episode of buck rogers on hulu.com. 

and I do get that the objective is to get rid of the USA and upturn the world order which will give strength to the weaker countries – but shor term will cause reat instability and long term will retard the growth of man – someone is trying to later get other countries on top – to do that you have to kill the leader.  But in this caswe it is not just a power struggle – there is a plan behind it. 

11:09 EST mother came up here to tell me we have laundry chute ( where she has lost clothes for several critical weeks) – but it was jus as I was thinking something else – calling me to brag you have a child as a high school roommate and a job and that seemed to be the reason for calling.  - I was looking over what I have of palladium deciding whether or not the larger guides to it are worth putting my savungs on the line or not – the answer is coming back – no – it suffers from middle earth's problem – from I.C.E – Iron crown enterprises – a system that on paper looks good and very detailed and interesting, but in practice will function poorly – too hard to keep track of all the details – rubbed left nostril side with right thumb- palladium is a bad rules system – he wassn't trying to help me – he was trying to cut down on the time I spent doing something else during high school – calling up to bragf later in 2004.  He kept copies of my drawings – the start of the collection – he wasn't a friend – none of them were.   Mother tried to get me down there before – they wanted me down there so people could see me.   And I got fired there – first place in my life.  And he knew the rat fink who ran it – head of the foundation – and the visit from another while in 3rd year in CMU.  - So trust no one is agood motto.  He is an American American as well – several generations.  - Because he used Palladium – they were afraid of the computers.   How many more “smurfs” am I going to see?  Rat fink – very wealthy rat fink – relatively wealthy – local radio show host to CT called him that – that ties it in with another group- all roads lead to the crossroads – uggggghhhhh. - he iniated those games senior year and it was very odd.

seeing finally and it did take me a while – that perhaps the biggest issue that Pittsburgh had with me above all else is that it couldn't control me – that I did get myself into a lifestyle where something couldn't just and take away my freedom and that no one else could push on me and get me to do something I didn't want to do – and they want people in that mode – where they have a mortgage and like a career job and debts that mean they have to live like that OR if an artist that they are tied to a group and to clients that support them – a person who needs little income and has no great debts is not someone you can't control – my student loan is $200 at most and not that currently – if I wanted I could pay it off now – and they gathered that because I paid more than the monthly payment in Pittsburgh – so it's not even really what I said – what I did – etc etc that's the big problem – it is being free and not welded into the system in a way they can push on me.  Forehead resting on first two index fingers – it's blatant political control – many will feel – didn't you get that? – NO – Everything I read says that's not supposed to happen – the employee leaving the door open to the commercial store and the 4 year old got in and played with the toys in the store – Pittsburgh didn't lock the door – and they blame me.   But that anology also implies that any other place will have similar conditions – and I'm sorry that's not fully acceptable to me – in other every one of you is lying about the true circumstances and none of the laws are real, all the regions of the US exercise control like that and you'd do the same Pittsburgh did – where they were trying to push me into a career and a lifestyle I didn't want and so you don;t look at Pittsburgh and say you should never do that – to you it is just – they messed up and don't want to admit it.  So you wouldn't let me write free and clear either.  I don't know – and you're not talking – and even if you were I couldn't believe what you said anyway.   But law isn't really the law if what goes on goes on – it's a tool to use in certain cases, I am – like for control – I'll have to find out and I may not agree with decision and may reject it – but for blatant – just we are supposed to be able to force him to do whatever we want to – and if we can't – we're gonna kill him.  Rubbed bottom of nose with left index knuckle – there is an element of that in my case – not just – hating my ideas and this and that – they don't approve of letting young people wander about on their own – they want control of them and were under the dellusion that they had control of me.    And it's blatant poltical force and power and a community's very strong desire to rule itself with an iron fist – stronger than I ever imagined a human could have- like in ethics and morals-  to me being like that is very immoral – very destructive.   It also only works if you're quiet- because when a stand in for Rush Limbaugh tells me I'm going to the gym – I don;t get that that means mother is coming home with those heavy bags of salt and I will have to haul them – just like in Pittsburgh I missed their cues or only would understand them later.   Where you're saying something and you're not really saying something.   The US is going to have to decide what type of country it is going to be – I am not in a position to make the decision on that- but I will pass judgment as best I can from where I sit and if that carries weight so it does.   To raise me with one set of values my whole life and be lying to me the whole time – well good day.    The Corps the Corps is father and kill anyone who gets in its way – ho ho ho ho ho ho ho – I almost sound like Santa Claus. 

kfyo 8:50 EST 1/4/09 – even this show is interesting – caller with God on a real estate deal – it wasn't through clever economic manuevering – it was the grace of God – we want people deranged and thinking the world runs on strawberry shrotcake so they are easier to manipulate.  Whooppee. 

mistype – redi.senate.gov – I caught it – hit the stop button – 1/4/09 8:26 EST

2 paste errors on rove.com 3rd try successful 8:22 EST 1/4/09 - touched toes of left and right feet together aqs I decided to email this and write it up - right ear itching.   suddnely closed lips. 

was going to email boortz from a different windows-  I have his opened – but decided to do it by typing his name and opening another one – I accidentally opened the first one when trying to go to the document to make sure I was emailing him the right thing and I hit the wrong tab and almsot used it before realizing the mistake.   It's like having a doesn(dozen) microphones attached to you. 

decided to go back to Senator Reid a third time – right thumb and index finger touched ever so lightly – then decided to wrtie it up left index and middle touched – 8:13 Est – just can't stop it. Ho ho ho – right middle brushed left index finger and there a touch in the right fingers just before that – and then touching thumbs as I decided to ass(add) the part about I think the right index and middle finger touching before the corss hand touch.   So this is what other people do with their days – figure out how to do this to people – wow. 

with senator reid a second time – had the wrong thing in the clipbaord – pasted wrong thing first – 8:09 EST 1/4/09.   - pinky on right hand bumped into empty yogurt cup next to it as I decided to go to another senator instead. 

there was a slight touching of my middle and inddex fingers in my left hand -followed by me curling my toes as I decided to write it up as I went back to and emailed mccain.senate.gov 8:07 ESt 1/4/09

and forgot with reid.senate.gov – did not have message ready that I wanted – just the single line forgot to compesate – wrong thing on clipboard when pasting – 7:51 Est 1/4/09 – so I decided to wait and mail him later.  and success - paste error on mccain.senate.gov -2nd time successful - so I won't email either - wait on him 7:53 EST.  Success because it made them do another error - bruth left hand under right under upperarm- by armpit  also as I wrote this up.  - and first try on rove.com but my left thumb still hit my stomach ever so slightly and ti doesn't normally do that.  and the typoing got slow for a moment.  7:58 ESt do it in Rove's window.  Coughing as I switch to the clintonfoundation.  Licked upper lip as I decided to go on t newt.org.   Touched right thumb to right index finger as I pulled up nightlybusiness.org instead. Normally it doesn't happen and I am having issues iwth my lips – touching them.  Touchign index and thumb again on right hand as I went to move off nightly business. 

paste error hutchison.senate.gov 7:48 1/4/09 - 2nd time successful.

the truth potentially – IF poor people or people who work for a living simply spent all their money on boos and odd things like the GEICO and bank commercials show – and that is the myth started by Andrew Carnegie – maybe not started by him – but he believed that too – that average people waste all their moeny so they need rich people to govern it for them and control their lives.   IF that were actually true THEN why a airplan pet service for dogs soliders want home, why gates foundation and others going into cancer research, why have Morgan Freeman on that united for health care – ah divided we fail -  IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY STUPID AT SPENDING MONEY THEN WHY MAKE ALL THESE FAUX CHARITIES AND FUAX THINGS TO WASTE THEIR MONEY – THAT ONLY  MAKES SENSE IF AVERAGE PEOPLE IF LEFT ALONE DON'T FULLY WASTE THEIR MONEY AND IF THEY ARE LEFT ALONE THEY WILL IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND IN TRUTH IT IS THE WEALTHY WHO DO SUPPRESS OR SOME OF THE WEALTHY WHO SUPPRESS THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS BY GETTING THEM TO USE FAUX CHARITIES AND BUY CRAPPY PRODUCTS – IF AVERAGE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID IF LEFT ALONE THEN THE RICH NEED NOT EXPEND ANY MONEY AND EFFORT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE YET THE WEALTHY ARE HIGHLY PREOCCUPIED WITH SCEMES AND AFFAIRS TO KEEP THE POOR POOR WHICH THUS HIGHLY SUGGESTS IF THE WEALTHY COULD BE BLOCKED IN THOSE SCHEMES THE POOR WOULD BECOME RICH AND IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND CARNEGIE BASIC ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT – THE POOR WON'T WASTE ALL THEIR MONEY-  THEY PROBABLY WASTE LESS OF IT THAN THE RICH DO – IF LEFT ALONE TO LEARN -  the issue is they are not left alone to learn – they are constantly barraged by peer pressure and strongarm tactics and manipulation through advertising to get them to do things that aren't logical.  Some of that they know – much of it is unknown.    Flocks of birds – 20 -30 east flying heading north – I wouldn't think they'd do that.   The weaslthy can make money off of charities – most of them have a connection to companies or high paying job-  an actor who sets up a foundation for hospital issues for example – to make money he or they could just do another movie – or write a book – a charity is not – there is work and cost – like to take people's compalints and research them – even if the idea is to block the complaint – someone has to take and research it – and you have to have a good show for the journalists -  Like there are two reasons to play with the poor and set up all these fake things and make fake products or products that are utter BS and everyone knows it – licking upper lip and now coughing – one is the reason stated above that yo uare afraid that if you do not control the poor, they will improve themselves and change the system and the reason someone doesn't want the system changed is they don't want to stop making money.   The second reason could be – that charities are easy money – a charity can be a good scam by which to enrich oneself and peers -  THE ISSUE IS IT IS NOT EASY MONEY – THERE IS WORK INVOLVED WITH MAINTAINING THE LEGITIMATE APPEARANCE CHARITY THUS IF YOU TRULY WANTED TO JUST MAKE MONEY AND WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE POOR AT ALL – YOU WOULD NOT GO THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL TROUBLE OF SETTING UP FAKE CHARITIES AND THIS ELABORATE SYSTEM -  and mother is out here on the balcony asking me if I want to go to mass with her a first in like 18 months – or more 7:23 Est 1/4/09.  And then I picked up a book without finishing the thought.   The point is that I can see only two possibilities for this elaborate scheme to condition the publci into illogical behavior – there are potential others – a form of of population control – etc etc – in honesty Greed is a big one and it is more believable to me that people set up this scheme to aggrandize themselves than to control the population or use or resources.  Many don't care past their death about resources.   So if the remaining to are direct aggrandizement through fake charity – OR using charities and other vehicle to siphon off money from the middle class – to both keep the middle class poor or not going anywhere fast AND very essentially to prevent the education and uplifting of the very poor in our society – really to prevent the teaching and education of all because in actuality that is very possible, but it will unmask a great deal of the illusion that the wealthy are so special and a big fear of the wealthy is potentially massive care and education of the poor and middle classes so various things are done to prevent that and one is siphoning off money – cancer research instead of education funding – making education super expensive – conditioning rural peopel not to get education via stupid comedian that pretend to speak for the common man when in essence they are ensuring their poverty.  And all those people who want to do something for healthcare.  Get  them to go into cancer research that is meant to lead nowhere and fund some wacko thing that will inevitably dead end – you'd be better off funding indy bands that you never heard of randomly for a better ROI.   Isn't neat how it all works together and we will have a president sit there and spend money he doesn't have because we cannot cut any healthcare jobs even if our healthcare more expensive not doing as well as countries at keeping us alive- at least form stats which could be altered by gremlins.   But instead – I can;t really believe he will ask for open votes on unionization – like I can't believe it – it would so not demoncracy – I know michael Moore says in past perforamnaces – we can pass any law we want to – I would look at the open vote law as an impairment on my freedom of speech and designed to curtail freedom of speech and thus a violation of the first ammendment – coughing as I write that.  But it is interesting to watch all the connections and then watch the incoming president and congress do potentially exactly opposite of what they should do to keep the country going – the banking stimulus appears to have done little and been a big joke that's not so funny to the tax payers and now MA governor and others want a trillion dollar stimulus – the other stimuli did not stimulate well – the governors should be smart enough to know fiscal policy and if it is organized to break the union by MA and NY and others – then let us redo 1865 where they are removed from office-  barred from holding polticial office and not given full membership in the union nor voting rights for several decade – this would include IL too – it more and more looks like people want to split union and bankrupt the USA to do it.  Economists are doing things intentionally not to help the economy but to destroy and steal as much wealth as poosible – transfer from dollars to gold or something like that as you get dollars and it will keep value.  It is disgraceful for the people entrusted with protecting the country to decide to tear into pieces – it is also very dishonest as if they feel that way they should have declared that openly.   With my comment below it looks more like even amazon.com and ebay are being censored for morality by the pocketbook and people are intentionally pricing items with messages against doing what is being done now to a place where most consumers are likely to turn away from buying them and the pattern is starting to look intentional – someone else who monitors amazon must have spotted that faster – any idea of punishment for colluding together or that you cannot win by getting rid of others: that bad things happen to you if you do that.   Any references to counter-balancing forces – which would worry the followers of certain people who are being used as pawns – Obama and Company know their illegal, but they are setting up so that removing them will be seen as racially motivated and doing it in a way to cause the most strife.  - Started on rich and ended up on Obama – that does happen – but it is a fight for control and like a nasty aftermath of the next moves is already planned.  Yippee. 

Grammar is becoming a big thing – with the correctives on radio now.   Started on TV internet video.   Not a big thing, but there have been several occurrences of subject and object mistake and correction. 

FL -  had first MIA in gulf war which sort of explains things now. 

Spanish version jonah is also expensive on amazon – they are blocking messages they want to eliminate.   Repent or God will killl you is the message of Jonah. 

And when designing a new role playing game it's not really cool that you swipe from my mind what I am writing about and like try to find people who have already designed it – like games that exist that sue a feature I thought up – scratched the back of my head on the word cool in the first line – If coke and pepsi and the rest are so big on proprietary information – they certainly aren't respecting mine – I can;t even get into the computer format stage-  where the ideas go from roughly pencilled notes to being typed up – they're already lifted and people are trying to say - “we'll see they laready did this” - they have failed to show that, but like if you can do that to me, little prevents one from lifting ideas out of other people's heads in say major corporations – and clearly you want a double standard – it is illegal to do it to you – but with someone like me, you'll cheat and you steal it from my head and then claim it's yours.  Like you showed two games that incorporate – the first was a clear-  see she did it first with Battle Galactica, but it sounds a little different than what I have in mind.  Rubbing corners of with thumbs – each thumb on the correct side- touching thumbs as typing -  one part is similar – the other part is not.   The other seemed more friendly and more of a – they might be interested in what you have to say.  But yeah like it's one thing for political but you steal every idea I have even while you are ardent defenders of the patent system which of course becomes rubbish if you can read a person's ideas.  No it's more important than ever – but it's a complete fake – someone does invent things – but the claims could easily be falsified- it becomes fairer not to allow exclusionary claims which will actually prevent theft than allow theft – the person making the exclusionary claim may well be the thief.  Rubbing left eye with left middle finger.  Even in the spell recharge in unearthed arcana not quite what I do.  

I did wake up at 1am last night – but it was momentary – they tried to get me to go to the bathroom – but they didn't have anything more a notion than a need – I went back to sleep and woke 3:40 Est – their power on me is weak – the reason mother and they are so keen to get me out of the house-  the other telepaths have lost the connection and with my changes in appearance or something they can't do what they used to do – they may have gotten photos yesterday.  But yes they can no longer interrupt my  sleep the way they used to.  I do have to walk to the post office to return a package.  I could see if I could call for a pickup.  - also the tongue blisters – that stopped – a few – like in the last couple nights – a few seem to come temporarily – but they too weak – it only lasted like an hour or two.  - coughing – mother can only do so much on her own – and the reason she is key to get me outside is so that other telepaths can help – because right now they are getting neutralized to a large degree- perhaps they are holding – not over several days – the overnights issues are stopping-  during the day when mother is awake is what is left.  - had to rub right cheek and left wrist.  

Methane scrubbing Solar powered polar bear windfarm zoos – an invention for the new year – gets quadruple tax credits and is thus profitable by 2 cents per year of use.   But onhly if you factor in the payback back – the upfront cost is tremendous and the break even point occurs in year 3000.  

-Ah starting to sweat although I am lying on the floor – and just knocked the cup over and had to adjust things and the smell of my feces is wafting to my nose although it shouldn't be that strong anywhere near me – hi mom – try again – I know you will – dribbling sweat onto my makeswift pillow-  19:13 Est 1/3/08 – after or actually while thinking up the blurb above – had the intense need to urinate – held it till finish – but then couldn;t hold it in bathroom  completely until getting to the toilet – and also got the intense need to defecate – not much urination or defecation in the end – left my room quick – usually bring something to work on – a book – writing something in the bathroom – after urinating but before defecating I turn around to find mother climbing the stairs at 18:55 Est to shut the window shades – she usually does that 21:000 or 20:00 she is early and was trying to block me in the bathroom without anything to do so I chose to let thing be partially out in back put my pants back on and run to my bathroom and she was eyeing and checking it out – I can tell monday and if I choose the trek to the post office I cannot avoid could be fun.  They want revenge and I will be vulnerable then.  Unless someone blocks them – theystill hope that they can get under my skin enough to make me want suiciide or to flee or attack them – I remember a prison guard who an inmate dinged a certain way and he went under and committed suicide.   It's like that-  they know with most people there is a limit – a point past which they can't endure- they are hoping to find mine.   A blind search of force now-  it is not one event it is a constant barrage – more in many ways than the past-  wanted to add more – but not sure there was one thought – specific thoguht – one thing they do try suicide and thoughts of fleeing and thoughts of anger – injecting those and see how far they go – I had a few – one 20 minutes ago – right after getting here and thinking can't I do it to her – ooh like a prickle in the air – room shoke – not an earth tremor – odd – but can't I focus on her like she focuses me and sit up here and while she is in bed cause  her body to be wracked pain – as she would do to me – she can't do fully that – she plays with my bladder and rectum and sometimes pain and sometimes forcing me awake-  something I did to the room has allowed sleep – I don;t know – I had good sleep the last couple nights – she doesn't want that to be – maybe a little becasue it is new year's and my normal demons are out partying – gremlins I should say are out partying and are not attacking me like they do – coughed as I started that thought on the gremlins partying.   -  but god tells me I shouldn't try something like that.   I for now agree.   It is like being locked in a cage with a demon.   Or perhap a mind flayer is a more appropriate reference.  - i did rearrange my room today and sge peeked in – why does that help – is their some way to better fight her – should i rearanged my books and furniture before bed – could I effectively lbock them from hurting me at night if I did? - I know you probably know answers – she is not stronger – but she has direct visual and auditory access to me – and tries to use that to beat you  - if I knew what to do – could I fight her better – I get it that you don't want to sue technique – because that can be copied- but just putting up with it all – it drives them crazy – because they believe in dominating and if you refuse to let them domiunate you  - . . . . . .  

I was going to mention – Travolta lost his son – did he intend for me to die in the bathroom in a similar way to his son – did scientology try that? - Tom Cruise – last week -  the CIA has appeared many times recently in ads – which is new – or the increased frequency is new-  and it used to mean every time a death threat against me – and generally with them – it appears – if you attempt to kill someone under their protection – the attempt fails and someone you care aobut suffers a similar fate that you intended for your victim – it is a decent deterrant-  though in my case the attempts have not stopped. 

I'm finally getting – rubbing right edge of lips with right thubma nd burping – I am finally getting that the reason Pittsburgh  hates creativity and hates people who do things differently is not that necessariyl it wants to stop innovation – it just wants full control – like they don't really think the invention – they just don't want the invention because it stops them from controlling if there is another way around them  -it's not fully the intvention they hate – it's the loss of contorl – and they are too shortsighted to see beyond control – they want to box up your options so they can better control what you do – it's not really a moral objection as much as they hide it in that-  it is an objection that they can't control when they  want to – bubonic plague time.

 FOX superscout of the boy scouts who is apparently jewish (here was a last name of a relative given)  and was name dropping Warren Buffet and real estate - “we get to pick who shines” - in which I will reject my home country and file for political asylum in another one – if this is your answer to me 17:48 EST 1/3/09 – you're right I will tire eventually of the arguing game of why I have to keep pleeding for some semblance of justice and I know Obama feels he is going to use my past statements or something to force into jail or a mental institution and  IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE -  I may soon need diplomatic protection from my president from foreign government – swiss used to pass out citizenship to jews in Nazi germany-  I may need something similar.   I wanted something else down but it is forgotten – there were 5 ammendments broken – and its going to get shoved under the carpet -  he said in the interivew the sky is the limit you can be anything you want – and he – just the fact of scouting – which my parents kept me away from – the whole interview was a stab at me – so be it – and the same – this is rude – one of the reporters was the one with the former Israeli ambassador who was not in my opinion – overly diplomatic – no even more than that- or I wanted to say more than that -mother is trying to block it and it is almost tipping back – I will tire and leave this coutnry in time – AH – she was trying to block I got it- I am beginning to think after everything the government has allowed to occurr to me-  perhaps I owe it a challenge – by forcing its hand – if it wants me so much – than I will purposely disqualify myself from the presidency by becoming a foreign citizen so that the only way I could ever run for certain offices is if there were a constitutional ammendment which there should be anyway because the native born thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   I really should be the one planning my own future – and no one has made a convincing argument to the contrary.   I do not like the gaming and there is gaming – there is some need-  but they are hiding behind part of that it appears to get what they want.  And I'm not sure I want that.  I don;t want to make their job overly difficult, but I dont; want to be used either – I don't like he pushed into hero thing – it hasn't worked in the past.   I can mess up bad.  Too many people are enamored with that.  - maybe if I immigrated back you could change my name.  - Give me a new social security number – etc.

the only way I can see HAMAS being less popular is if the Palestinian authority is successful with it's territories and HAMAS appears to have squandered the future of the people – Gaza resembles Darfur including hostilities with the state near it – it's not a perfect resemblance but it is there – Darfur is not a stable situation and without some shift in politics or demographics – shift in demographics bluntly meaning the population changes its face – without one of those – there will not be peace in that region.  The hatred is too strong.   There is a reason HAMAS wins over the PLO- the situation will be interesting to see in 4 months-  or later – with respect if you have a way to make this anymore than a temprorary victory, you are very creative.   By achieving temporary peace the hatred wil foment – even if well-intentioned – no people likes having their government toppled at the will of their neighbor.  Would any of them trade living spaces to somewhere else.  - There is one place – integrate the population.  - And how accurate is Bush's picture? - That HAMAS is fully to blame – integration of the wrong sort will be perceived as trying to further destroy Palestine.   - Israel's moves so far will acheive a “temporary lull” - it will be very difficult to one destroy all HAMAS arms and two prevent HAMS from rearming though I may be wrong on that it depends what they do – but I would think that their actions currently only set up the conditions for a new cycle of violence – unless they add something else.  Again I want to see the situation 3-4 months from now. 

oddly enough my idea of just leaving the package I wanted to mail with the postal carrier did not fly – she claimed it was too heavy being over 5 lbs – I know from Pittsburgh that in the general mail drops they ask you not to do over 14 ounces – there is a limit in Pittsburgh in the general post boxes – to rpevent issues-  have to look – of course a house isn't a general mailbox and it would be kind of stupid to blow up the postal worker by giving them a package that you mail from your doorstep – that would be the height of idiocy and highly unlikely and it would be kind of a good service to allow packages that are declared to be picked up in this day of amazon.com – amazon said something about if I put the other type of thing on – the one printed out from my computer that it would be picked up – by USPS from home – well this was going to amazon – same place – but I got a no – and I know the other reason why – if the postage was ever insufficient she would be in trouble or something – of course that happens with regular packages and they return them to sender – so that eliminates that – what else was I thinking – they don;t check in our post office what's in it so it is not more secure – it could be sealed their too and just a nod.  I get the feeling that if I were on better terms with her should we have picked it up and there would have been no problem – but a fuss was made because it could be and I am who i am and the USPS complains about losing business.   Lost a thought back there -

and I did just get off the phone amazon and apparently in other cases instead of having a package it would have been picked (up) in other cases  and they do expect in other cases that USPS will pick up a package with amazon markings going to amazon.com – ah – I wanted to say earlier – the USPS.com number she referred me to the local carrier who twice would not answer the phone yesterday.  So I never could get an answer yeah or nay if I could do this.  I tried it anyway and amazon is telling me if I printed the label it probably would have been okay, they kind of expect it to be okay.  Which kindof makes me wonder – EVEN IF THE LABEL ISN'T PRINTED BUT IT'G GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE RIGHT BOX WITH STAMPS ON IT – WHY WOULDN'T YOU PICK IT UP FROM A PERSON WHO YOU'VE SEEN?  - and at least with one carrier we have seen each other once, I give her a lot of business and yeah they can make me walk – that's not what you would generally do if there is any give and that person funds your service.  And I do give a lot of business to post office – the union sucks and is so self-interested it even hurts customers to preserve itself – which is why it kills companies- because it will go at paying customers who it doesn't like if they do other things it doesn't like.   You screwed up – you can force me out of the house and you'll get it now-  oh yes you will – but you shouldn't of and – it is kind of really unfriendly and poor service to have this happen – especially finding out in other cases she would accept the package from amazon and just in my case didn't want to – i do receive a lot of mail and the shipping and handling fee goes to pay her salary – but we didn't want you to do things the way you were – we wanted you to leave the hosue -  YEAH BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO AND I FOUND A WAY AROUND AND YOU USED FORCE TO BLOCK IT AGAIN AND IF IT WERE YOU'RE FRIEND YOU'D LET IT THROUGH AND I BET IF YOU RIGIDLY ENFORCED THAT ONE IT WOULD HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND LIKE – SO IT IS A DOUBLE STANDARD AND IF YOU PLAY THAT WAY OKAY – MY BOSS MAY PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU AND HE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL UNIONS COMBINED – SO WE'LL GO HERE.   Enjoy winter and spring and summer and fall too.   Maybe a cloud of coal dust will poison the water for miles around who knows where by an accidental tornado in the wrong place.  You want a double standard where someone who thinks doesn't get rewarded for thinking – and that is way to drive society into the ground- we the mob wins at the expense of someone who made a better plan because the mob can cheat on the rules and their are no rules or protections for the thinking person.   Let's keep dancing.    I get about 20-30 packages a month in mail and I must you know generate $100 or something for the post office.   A month -  I can't go anywhere else – just like bank of america – and that is the plan get everyone so mad they start a Bolshevik revolution and destroy the US – that is what is wanted – what I think Barack Obama intends to induce – get people angry and mad and get them to want to revolt – while thsoe same people are hoping to lead the revolution and crack down on all civil liberties.  - It was about a 5 lb package 4.9 lbs polus packaging.    - the rep of amazon confirmed that it was the discretion of postal carrier – but that is it – it was her discretion it sounds like in other places they do take packages for people – and in my case she decided not to take an order marked to go to amazon and weighing 5lbs – which isn't all that heavy – it's a rural route – not as rural as could be – but it isn't the city – it's a retirement community and she chose the hard route with the rules – I start thinking of PA and Pittsburgh and the postal clerk who later got fired for not wanted to take a package she said wasn't packed well – and the Fedex guy at kinkos took it just fine – that clerk even started ripping up the address label so I would have to run home and get the address again – putting her pen through it – it was weird – and she was one of theirs – that was the one where when I reported a missing package later – that women apparently got fired and the other clerks there were mad at me and right after I reported the package a car with tinted windows in an empty parking lot behind the Frick gallery drove in fast at me – not like actually threatening to run me over or actually trying to run me over – just implying it – came into the lot fast and out of the lot fast – there have numerous issues with postal carriers.

Disappearing Youtube Videos
we  are a tad “petty” - on youtube – justify my love – like a virgin – Madonna or somebody pulled many of her videos  and the one I mentioned – that is your territory -it is saying a lot that jsut to prevent me from using it as an example – you'd pull most of your videos – or at least some of the ones I know best – for a material girl – which was the video left-  you aren't really thinking with your wallet right then and there.   You might argue long term that getting rid of me is profitable and first priority – it's an intersting argument to make – very well -  13:00 EST  1/3/09 – I did want to add for some – those are the VIDEOS I respect best for getting across a point -and the ones I know about off hand – not all of them are the songs I like hte best – audio is not video and some artists are stronger with their audio than their videos who are singers or perofrmers.

pasted mail list 2 into hannity.com 11:55 EST 1/3/09


there was a silverfish in the bathroom last night.  Today 1/3/09

Seem to be getting away from saying this several tiemes – but I get the feeling you think it would be a good idea to push me out into the open – there si a reason I don't come out in the open – in fact – all recent experiences significantly justfiy my caution – I would not have ahd these discussions unless my life depended on it – there is sort of this american – it's best if you don't ahve to hide – we want to see you – BUT YOU DON'T  - and my previous experience where people just cannot handle it – and you are kind of forcing me out into the open – and I was doing my best to avoid that- I am not fully happy with the result – and please don't tell me it was not part of your intent to look at that- showing people what goes on behind the scenes – yes it would be better in time – it isn't right now – for many reasons people cannot handle it – I did in a way want to expose some of my ideas – not in this fashion and hwo they ahve come out – it may ahve been the only way – as I stated a few months ago – so far it looks like you are not taking steps to allow me back inot hiding – but are taking steps to need to push me out to resolve this-  for that I am right now not grateful – my worst fears about the public have been confirmed at this point.   It would be better in a way not to be hidden – but you forced it – and I was right to hide  - peoplecannot deal well with me.   Tehir reaction is to try to kill me.   - coughing up phlegm-  you want things to turn out a certain way – I ma pretty sick of the double dealing behind my back  - on my fate.   - I don't trust that aspect of you -  you'll like it when it was done – I don't want to find out when it's done just in case I don't like it – I can be a pain in the asbestos if I choose to be and be highly uncooperative – itching left side of neck.    Why don't you jsut leave me alone – that may not be possible – but – I am worried that you are a planning a surprise – I don;t want antoher surprise – there have been enough surprises and i know there will be more yet.  Scratching left temple with left fingers.

I Can Get A Lot out of All American Rejects, “Give You Hell”
I Get a Lot Out All Amrican Rejects “Give You Hell” and “We Didin't Start the Fire” Billy Joel – Madonna – whether I like her or not – “Just Like a Prayer” – “Move Along” All Aermican Rejects - - “It Ends Tonight” All American Rejects – the Wendy's commercial - “Russian Fashion or UUSR Fashion Show” - in fairness Madonna can do it in others – she can also hide a message in hers – the wiccan initiation in like a prayer - - but she does do a story with her videos well and she can do it – like her or don't like her. 
Why is a msuic video better than even a decent lecture – for instructional puposes -  Ah finally something I can contribute versus just responding to whatever someone wants me to respond to – I will a music video – the right one – not just anyone-  but if it connects I will watch 100 times – until I have memorized everything going on in it-  Lectures in prfoessing a subject are meant to have one thing going on in them – teacher treis to be very straightforward and ensure student gets the one thing – butyet a music video many things go – the well done ones – I named them up top – or a few examples- where it is a story in the music video start to finish – EVERYTHING in the best ones focuses on that stroy – the backround isn't wasted – the facial expressions aren't wasted – everything focuses on the story and like Give you hell conveys very well like the struggle between different genre's in our society – billy Joel tried to tell 3-4 decades of US history in 4 minutes – to some degree – but his is the best example of like telling a meaninful and educational story in 4 minutes and thinking about every single piece in the presentation – a pop up window came up on the “abou” of the about in the last line.  Lipped upper lip -  but why can't and educational video be more like that – where the idea is not to grasp everything the first time but to grasp pieces -  “because you would have utter choas” - maybe and you wouldn;t be able to linearly cover a topic per se – but the artists and I named 4 can do and not wind up with chaos every time.   Sesame street has distracting songs and music that many times have nothing to do with the concept being taught by the words of the character talking or the pictures shown.  Many times there is a message conveyed -a s they do opera spoof and classical music spoofs and what not – they do convey messages – but it's not necessarily fully just education for reading.   How about a rock video on the periodic table showing pieces of it – the groupings – I'm not quite sure without htinking it out how you could condense it all – have chemical formulas being said with the electron dot diagrams in the background and showing the formulas in the center.   Showing the actual reaction on a side maybe – itching my right knee with right fingers wildly – stop scanning what I write without being in the room mother.   It doesn't have to be a rock video – but yes use the lessons of that and how they communicate and use that in education -  woe – organizing educational videos and complex graphic and audio-visual elements – as I element teaching jobs – it looks like I just created a new slot for artists and much more focus on the instruction which will mean new jobs-  but the teacher's will complain and protest to ensure they have jobs.   Scratching left elbow with right fingers.   The idea isn't per se to try to “make it cool” - or pretend fakely to kids that you understand them – the idea is to get better use out of the graphic medium.

So we halted war usable item trade with Japan before pearl harbor.  They were attacking other countries to prompt that.   There was apparently from what I saw a detailed plan on

Odd breathing – sortr of a snort is used as a dominance attack a lot to let me know I was spinning

As was pointed out to me in college there is one and maybe two professors who were obviously polish by name – though one's married name – she kept her own name – but yes nothing that I remember currently went wrong on that score in cmu.   The second person had limited contact with me – even if he could bump into me in another where I was essentially hiding from the other faculty and students in a pretty much deserted corridor – what are you doing here? – I might ask ou the same question.. 

I don't want – French – no students but incidents with just about every French Teacher – not language – French american – and there weren't many if any French American sudents – both Calculus teachers were French by odd coincidence – one from France – one in high school and one in CMU – music in elementary school – then 5th grade or 6th she was both years – I am skipping one there – I can't find something he did – things happened around him and were trigered by other children – one time – I don't see anything that he did.  I spun trying to think about other people and possibilities – but 4 out of the 5 seemed – odd things happens or there is an incident where something stuck as why did that happen – and the last case the wrong in the wrong place at the right time to make sure things went wrong – and CCAC fought like hell not to let me retake that course – my failure was planned – and I messed it up.  Rubbed bottom of nostril with index finger.   There weren't many french altogether.  “You can do this with every group” - that's just it – no, I can't – it doesn't work with Indian professors – it doesn't work Italians – there are individual – but not 80% - 20% if that – I don't think it works with the Irish – there were some bad experiences – but no I can't start going there was a negative experience with every person of this type. 

as I was clicking through the screens to return my books on amazon 7:59 Est – mother came up starting questioning me through the door – throat burned a little and I coughed up mucus – she wants me to go outside and run the beach.  And don't flush food down toilet – though there is no way she should know that.   We are on a septic system and not a sewer.  - She is lying though – about how dangerous it is – though someone will try to make her seem right – she doesn't want food flushed because then she loses count and control.  - the game with “move along” the song – but used by nice productions – you are always hoping to find the one thing that will break me put me over the edge -

doing 9x6 in my head when I meant to do 9x4 = and nearly getting calculation wrong – passed gas as I started writing this – et out of my head mother.  - mailing a return from home using stamnps – they don't like it – 8:39 EST 1/3/09 – don't ahve to take a trip to the post office – can stay in house more order stamps online. 

Dupage county – he lived in somewhere like that.  Dekba- that around here – Dupage – no Dupage was way outside the city wasn't – next county over – it's a combination of two names they try ot fool me that – have  my mind combine two names – so I can't see – it's partly familar and partly wrong – rubbed right side of face with right middle finger – well it there is a dupage county and I remember what the reference is to – but I wanted Des Plaines.  That was his town.

So Many Things to Remember
um there were two odd incidents – being asked to eat the leftovers – twice in my life – once by the – where did he live northwest chicago – but Lawrenceville but that's not it it's in Pittsburgh – but he took the metro in – not metro – metra as they are two different systems in Chicago  – I visited there in 2004- the office is gone – but he gave me leftovers after eating with some of our clients who in the end asked me to do something I shouldn't have had to do – it is odd for a boss to give leftovers from a restaurant outing iwth clients to his intern -  It also happened at DAM early when I came back in 2004 – someone offered to take me on a boatride and I declined so they offered me some leftover something in a plastic tin – container – deep or potato something – again it seemed out of place – polish –  at DAM I also got offered Humus earlier by someone who quit in 2003 – a woman – night shift – but those two incidents they gave me a container only I ate out of -  the first one was sausage and potato or cabbage  - it is german – it is also polish  - that means only the relgious fanantic in Chicago was clean – I do not know what to think on Milan – he was a nexus – saw him twice – he got me out of chicago or his wife did – but yet from what I could gather he was really angry with me – he read to me when I left in 2000 about this roofer who got electrocuted in Pittsburgh – had his asbestos blown out when he touched a wire – as he was saying we all are not thankful enough for what we have – and I guess- like he released me – he manueverd my anger and he did – it was pretty odd how I get(got) treated in that office the second time – rubbed left ear with left middle finger – they were the ones who intensely appeared not to like another group of people – by race – and his wife called me out of the blue without prompting in Chicago and that did trigger me coming back to Pittsburgh – I wanted to go back to Pittsburgh and not stay in Chicago after 18 months, but I probably would not have left on my own.  I think in the end I was fortunate to leave Chicago - - he sort of helped get me out of architecture in a smaller town – Pittsburgh is a town in many ways – it's harder to find work as an architect in Chicago it would be harder to pretend I couldn't – there was the odd call from the mormon before I left who hadn't talked to me in about a year.   The two sides were keeping track of me.  Milan was dirty  - it's probably time to start laughing darkly.  The religious evaluated me and then let me go – I hope someone knows while I didn't use a car too much – I did drive down to see him in Southwest – I jsut didn't park too well as usual – cause he asked where' your car  and I didn't say – about ½ mile or more away.   Coughing as I mention – the cloned Senator more or less not quite cloned and not quite realted though it seems that way.  - so geramns get carefully “managed” by other groups in the coutnry – yet I know in high school who introduced me to CMU – she probably helped a great deal – was I a test for Pittsburgh – it appears CMU wants to dump me and get on the Harvard band wagon – whatever – was I given to CMU as a test of Pittsburgh?   That one person who I met up with in the first few days who kept bumping into me and saying hello who was from PA.    All these dances in the shadows of where I lieved and no one bother ed to tell me anything.  So it's come out like this, because it had to come out.  Right thumb scratching right corner of mouth -

We Can't be Nice to the Hamster and it Cause All Sorts of Problems
On the TN water issues and pollution – there weree 2 incidents where my water supply was polluted – it is true that one was voluntary – but it was induced by others and I was duped into polluting my water supply and apparently that gave me all that wondrous phlegm that came up on demand – I am sure some of you found that very funny when my throat burned and when I had to change things – it apparently is less hillarious when its your children.  You have been told to stop harrassing me on numerous occassions.  God was just a little more direct this time.  Your likely answer will be to hit harder wich no doubt will be blunted as the attacks have been and then the reprocussion will be harder.  Hearing an awful lot of CIA ads recently, what that portends is unfortunate.  Also there have been several references to a corrupt high level person in the spy agency – history of i happening in th UK and a reference before that – AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I guess we do start off the year monitoring cow flatulence – the postal service is unionized isn't it? - I thought after yesterdays phone conversations. 

Be nice to your hamster  it never did ya any harm, Don't track your hamster, he never gave you cause for alarm – we make up a nice jingle perfect for singing on long foot trips – even borrow a bouncing ball from car or pet food commercials.  I might even dye my fur pink temporarily much better than trying to put a bell around my neck – lord know what was in those little gifts mother gave me – how small are tracking devices anyway?

a clean place is easier to tell if someone has been there that is why people have a cleaning fettish.   They know what you did better that way. 

there is a polish issue – high school and elementary – 2 instances each that I see – high school more – but 2 in elementary – and then Pittsburgh – the thread follows – in Pittsburgh I can't connect a person – but there were in elemenary and high – elemtary into junior – mother's election helper – she is running around now downstaits – I can't trace – Milan? - Chicago – I didn't know the names – the last names of most people I worked for were pretty neutral – I never suspected.  - 3 – oh wow – 3 – so much of this country hated me – driveways and odd trades – a one time incident – just happened – left no mark – just wanted to know me.   It was odd like I knew no one from around me – but people from farther away – it wasn't an accident – none of it was an accident as early as – pretty early – it wasn't accidental – children aren't fully innocent for very long – the same people in one case where one thing happened – they would appear later – much later college from elementary school – I don't know what happens to others – in my case none of the schoolage incidents were that random – very few – cause you can trace the same few classmates involved – i's not like all of them -

fed up and sick - don't know what was going here 

I have actually been sleeping - throwing a certain pin out of my room and one two other things seems to have helped and ended the nightly urination incidents-  I should mention there was a visiting polish architect of course for a while - he left in my 4th year - but he had ve4ry little direct contact with me - none actually - and none of it originated from Poland before - it was polish americans - I don't see a link there and one has not been brought up  - but the other stuff - it's like a smaller example of what happened with - others.

It is telling that $4 prescription (drug prescriptions) are compared to candy – sugar does less than other medications in manipulating the body. 

 I do care some about not failing – but these tests never seem to stop – and you shouldn't be able to do that. 

who was being tested by Israel – Obama or someone else – I have not been convinced you really have a right to keep playing with me – it's just not right – you want to force me to accept something  AT THE SAME TIME ALL MY LIFE I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT -  it's a very quixotic strategy – I am not happy about that part of it – you qualify and your getting treated this way whether you like it or not – no – I don't even care that I passed- you are using pressure to box me in so I give honest answers and take a test I ahven't fully agreed to take – and it never ends – it isn't fair that you keep doing and it goes to saying you could end the situation I'm in whenever you want to – I am in this situation by your will because you know I would never agree willingly to what you want if you asked honestly- so you did it dishonestly- because you need to know at this point- and my say over my own life is forfeit – rubbing left side of left nostril with left thumb – do you  understand that no one has gotten handling me right at this point even the military has screwed up – I am the best qualified to handle me – and you have thrown away all control for these tests that have gone on forever – and they are jsut tests – you could have stopped it at any time – I sorta knew that- are you going to tell me to do when push into whatever slot you have in mind as well? - when does it end- and I will be afraid when it does end-  because then there'l be no guidance and I will be shoved into a slot that I don;t even know what to do with – yes I could probably figure it out – I don;t agree agree and fought in my younger years the exact philosophy you have used to govern me that I now have to live by – I ahve accepted that-  but I still disagree and still think you're wrong and do chafe every time it seems like – we'
re still not satisfied – we want one more thing yet – there is a crisis – but . . . . . at the same – you wanted to use the crisis to amnipulate inot a palce where I wouldn't lie to you and wouldn't say no to what you wanted when i would have said no otherwise-  and you knew that- it's good for you – WE WILL SEE ON THAT ONE WON'T WE – I have no doubt I would be a very different person if the envionrment were more supportive-  I care – but I no longer necessairly want to fix it all – I will find soemthing – it will not be what would have happened-  but I no longer want that – so much has happened and there is so much hatred for me – that is all – real -you are choosing not to fully suppress it – let me see it – let them attack me in limited ways- see if they ever stop – see if I ever break – yo uwanted me marked imperfect a little it helps induce the crisis so you can control me – I knew that or if I didn't I was an idiot – you will keep me marked until you don't want me marked – you could have fixed it a long time ago – is that supposed to make me feel better? - I no longer know how to respond to all of this - - whatever – I can't really stop you unless I commit suicide.   Yo uahve not convinceed this is better – I would not have chosen a full test just yet and maybe never – but I was chewing away little by little and I was comfortable at the pace I was going – who are you to tell me it was wrong? - It was my life.   It's not where you wanted me – but who are you to decide so roughly?   Cause there is a chess game element between the two sides – you are playing with each other and to you it is not fully serious – but it does affect my life and possibly fully and I get sick of finding out – to you it's a big deal – to me it is – they fight like hell because they don't want to lose – but they won't be killed if they do lose – they won't even lose profitability fully if they lose – they will some power- but that gaming element to it.  Like it's that military and psuhing you and pushing at you every way until you are so strong you can take anything – but it hurts like hell the way they do it -and from the sounds of it they tell you when they do it – you ahve to agree – you hoodwinked that part – because I would never agree -  AND YES I WOULD NEVER AGREE AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE – DAM PUSHED – BUT YOU DIDN'T BLOCK IT – AND IT IS HARD TO JUDGE FULLY -  BUT YOU WANTED SOMETHING AND TOOK IT FROM ME WITHOUT REALLY ASKING AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT.    Whatever.  - why did you wait until today to reveal the backstory to the conflict – you didn't let me know until today – who was the agressor – it seems like a test of me – how deep is my hatred for Israel- I don;t care that I passed-  there 's stil lthis thign where I'm not in cotnrol of my life anymore- and that is deeply troubling – I don't wnat a gandalf around me – this isn't the hobbit – but you're not going ot let me out of this-  you want to know thigns and you will force me into tests as long as you can – and I will not know if you need them or not – but it is getting clearer that if you wanted to – much of the pressure could vanish on me – part of it is kept up just to get me to comply with the exam – which has gone on for years – all because the military seems to have msised a model for bringing up a person that I represent – itching center forehead with left index finger joint-  I don't care – I was modelling my life – and you destroyed that to answer your questions- yo uhave been there and playing – but I lost full control for a long time – and you very carefulyl control what I do this last year – I do not have freedom of even thought – you contorl what things I write ,read , and do – ne4ar totoal control – pushing me out of certain activities and into others – and it is clear that only some of it is for my safety – part  of it and part of the mystery is just to be able to keep plying me into whatever you want me – rubbed left with top left index finger jointright next to nail.  Before thindex finger joint referred to lower one.   You didn't have to do it – you chose to do it and nwo the marine corps apparently hates me – along with all these other people who found out about and shouldn't have known and in part you decided to let that be.   I don't by how much.  There is I don;t know and a lot of it affects me -   YOU DIDN'T KNWO TESLA AND ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS – LET THEM BE – YOU ARE SUCH  POOR JUDGES ALL GOVERNMENT HAVE MESSED UP TERRIBLY – TURING – WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM !!!!!!!    - whatever – you don't negotiate and it is not a good time to bargain – nor will there be – but now is bad.  - so be it.

Mark Simone  for Sean Hannity

blaguyovich as a hobbit according to caller- when host says he likes the cockiness – everyone I  - when they love those kids more than hate us – get tired of being pounded into the ground – I am a hamster – I have had to live in the ground.  - and the caller knows a lot of special forces – so how many of them would you like executed for breaking their oath and coming after me – because execution is the tehnical penalty – because they are I am assuming Us special forces and bound by their word – to protect not attack a US civillian – if they're foreign and attack me on US soil – oh that gets itneresting -

netflix – the government movie capital – yes – they have aligned with the children it appears – and they give me ads a lot – banner ads.  

what Japan's legitimate grievances (for WWII) ? – callwer – Nazi prisoners in US got movie passes – uncle didn'ty mention that – great uncle actually – we never met – only stories through parents -  firebombing of Dresden killed civillians – and he said nothing just a laugh – daughter could not drink – it is about the arsenic in the water in TN – which mother let me hear on NPR -  you don't mind it if I can't eat – now your daughter can't drink – amd I bet she can – but it's difficult – do unto others as you want them to do unto you is a Christina comnandment – did you “forget” that one with me ?  - perhaps you are being reminded – God likes that – if you would take away another's hosue than your hosue is taken away if you woudl deprive one of sustenance then yours is taken away.  17:44 EST 1/2/09

how are you is actually a deadly question like how are you feeling – peopel pushed to a brink – my vie principal in high school said to me about the people who put drugs in my locker – fake drugs-  but they were menat to look real – if they can't respond to a caertain amount of discipline they will be out of the school – if that were an anology itr would mean what it would mean – the terms of what can happen have been spelled out – you will not admit that you don' hold a winning hand – and it appears my boss one day will get serious and if you do not respond to discipline when your are WRONG – then you won't be inc school – whatever that means.   Wasn't it a TN senator thinking he could play with me ? - TN has been a problem recently – your caller has gotten agitated over “Palestine” as he termed it – 17:38 Est – 1/2/09 – knocked down world trade center and were in afghanistan – host talking . There   Military interrogator of foreign military – is the caller.  

GEICO ads illustrate how stupidly people will spend any extra money they have – bank ads do that too – the family pet with the wireless commercial for a phone on TV a while or – jacuzzi in car trunk – that was an ad campaign – a rich argument the poor would spend money in a way dumber than we would – BULLSHIT – you going to wreck society – and blow up the country into two pieces and you made those people that stupid – by your actions in large part – they are a reflection of you – think on that-  their stupidity points to your stupidity if you were the dominant market forces.   Think on  that. 

 however big you are – certain people are key and other are not – Tesla is worth more than Carnegie to society and you won't acknowledge who coutns-  didn't I write a book on this in library of congress-  before destroying it read the first two chapters – competition is weaker than invention – and your money and title and power don;t change that- you are a temporary illusion of this time that is repsected more than tesla and others becasue society is not a rational judge as a whole – and it is not.   Dinner time apparently -  nuthouse with maddoff – martians burning brain out that calculates – all threats – oh yippee joy -= more threats – ho hgo ho – dinner time  - Ray it was I guess

Sal – overreacting to killig innocent chidlren – he means me – getting bombing by Isalmic rterrorists – he is wording things so they can apply to me – that I am not an innocent child and that he keeps being hit with bombs-  as I uncover things -   take appropriate action – Bush deicdes that you don;t – you cheated on the election – Pittsburgh is wrong and won't admit it – good day  17:13 Est 1/2/09

donny st louis – not responding to call

walmart bombthrat(bombthreat)  in TX – there are a few things going in walmart in lubbock these days – it coudl be connected – I would bet money on it at this point.  - all the activity at walmart discourages sales and certain higher class people who normally don't shop here and MIGHT WANT TO START - that is the way to stop them from starting  - walmart online might be an interesting tool to use with some.

Eliot spitzer hotel.  - for Obama – this occurred earlier. 


Phoenix Jim – 70 – auto bailout philosophy- it sounds liberal but is not – govt buys 1 million car in 2009 and 2010-  city and satate cars are from GM -  pay upfront -   I think govt car issues need not be as big as the 3 commercial car comapnies if that is the need – we don't need them – we dcould make a different  - I don;t understand why Gm does so much better abroad-  I would guess they can get away with more BS here – and try to sell at premium in US – and in other coutnries they actually compete – they could price different in other countries than in US – and with Nafta – not NAFTA WTO – mroe taxes for foreign cars in their countries-  WTO prevents taxes in some palce-  I would think pricing is done differently – so big 3 – gouge US customers potentially – but American.  The need of police and other things could be accoomodated without big 3 – make a plan – but get rid of unions and unprofitable companeis that don't want to be in capitalism any longer and it sounds liek they will not disappear they are children who want extra cookeis and think they can get ird of or neutralize opposition. 

Reno- Rick -0 how u doing -  don't understand the economy-  that's a code – they all rate their education – and he slipped in something softly while I was typing – car thing – they are being boring to try to get me not to lsiten – see where I don't see   - give me a million dolalr caller – H beer industry ever need a bailout or porno industry- they might with me -  we need big 3 for war – no we don't – we probably could “Create” an industry as needed.  -  we DON'T NEED THE BIG 3 -  buy a wii – do GM workers want to get government salaries if they want a government bailout – militay salaries? - I am not for that either

Miami – charity – dumping thousands of shoes – I need shoes – sometimes – glue could be drying out – oh . . . . wait there is a backup isn't there – did someone figure that out – I didn't want to mention that – there is a backup shoe – unless someone threw it out.    And I got around the trek coming up it woiuld appear. 

NY family – sppecial needs son left strapped to a public city bus seat or a bus seat overnight – could not get up – amber alert – silver star alert dea l-  on kfyo – ho ho - `16:03 EST 1/2/09  - when do these people get arrested for like terrorism.   - like with kennedy and burris – they are like poison pills – the senate should throw them out or challenge them along with Franken – but each one will stir up a hornets nest and that is the point – others can play games if they get struck down.  - lost special needs child. 

Avalanche issues in WA – people want to go snowboarding anyway – risk getting caught by going through roadblocks-  yes we can. 

Jennifer  she was on a charity person – non-profitr worker – one of these was - – didn't complete a point – seemd to jump all over- may be making fun of what my wqriting sounds like – but she is on air – and that was an interesting call – I also wasn't typing on computer- which may be why she was not coherent-  she knew she wouldn't catc h me-  writing off computer which somehow I can listen and write off the computer better.   - started with thing about some liberal callers not stupid. 

TGIM – Thank God it's monday- we are still going to see plenty of fruicakes -  Travolta's son has died – that chruich scientology is not such a good thing – they lie. 

I got the brother of Obama and the aunt of Obama points on Limbaugh – a flwesh eating troll would be kinder to deal with as president.   The cia again 15:52 Est – on kfyo – their ads are more common and I am beginning to think it no longer signals what it used to. 

tax cuts drive economy – defucut spwedning gets an economy moving – Reagan did it – Jeff – he seemed to get angry as I elaborated on the last call -his tone got hostile – I wans't listening to him. -  caller Jeff - - I had a computer error which caused a lapse- 15:48 eSt 1/2/09

save money for a little while – this caller sounds almost pittsburgh – the diction on that – anybody who pays 0 taxes-  there are people who don't buy anyhting  - they pay no tax – yes so what the caller is trying to do is say my way of life will destroy everything – couldn't we just revise how taxes are collected -versus killing me off- if that is issue – I need a lot less services than people to because I don't own a home and it does reduce waste and not owning a car reduces use of gov't services so is it so unfair I pay little taxes-  the gov't power of Pittsburgh does not want to risk reducing size so it wanted o condition me against my will to spend more- but that is against the constitution and they “overlook” what is lost by taking hte attitude they have the right to condition me to spend more to float their gov't when they are losing people and city services aren't so necessary and perhaps they should cut jbos out of the city governmwent-  because they do have less people – and they try not to.   Tehy don;t want to hear later that will lead to more jobs- better o get rid of unproductive jobs- but Pittsburgh didn't work that way

Mark Stein  - for Limbaugh – 1/2/09
Zaron – Candian lsiten ot Limbaugh – may know host – are you following Canada gov't and mistkaes.  H Jim Jeffords – switched parties – on being refused to teacher's association -  civil war and total collapse – in US over teacher awards – Canada – Quebec – politics flipping parties – Vermont – is not Granholm that is MI – telegenic – granholm is telegenic – what comes of her mouth does scare me though – and I do listen. 

and yes the comment about Obama gets less check over than any foreign national in this country is true - I didn;t think about that- the media is really like turning a blind eye - cause it is hard for me to see that-  I complained a little - I didn't realize how blatant it was and that no person entering this coutnry got such a look over.  That is true though

CA – Ken – tried to catch me with many numbers – pretty much kept up  - more is spent on CA's worst performing school systems – I did not get down the 20,000 – I did get down the 13,000 or first number on that score – so I got down the point – and he went through several sets of numbers the  school system ones and I guess not numbers-  but various sayings with ford -

sicne I emailed switzerland there has been a burning sensation in my privates specifically in my “member” - first a sharp pain – when I got the swiss emial address as it got dropped it appears – the burning with a little pain – is still going several imnutes later- I did eat an oragne and maybe acid- oragnes don't suually do that.  - I sense a beign downstairs who resents me getting out of being sick agian.  I stayed up here in covers and my body got warmer versus helping her with groceries when she could have been carrying a germ from walmart customers or people in walmart when resitance was down. 

government can put conditions on giving you healthcare if it is socialized

socailized healthcare – don't cure illnesses – want them to be chronic- a

Or I think – soicalized medicine – never heard you before are u english – I screwe up that question several months ago when i heard Mark Stein the first time.  - more MRI machies in philadelphia than in all of Canada – oh there's no black market-  yes – doctors become terrorism possibilities if they are immigrants – as mine was who was not american.  - and I did remember that. 

Rush will be back fighting fit on Monda – he needs a suit of powered armour – along with giant cattle prod that can zap callers voer their phone line.

I get it that Arjn(arn) is the test of whether the enviro-wackos are sincere Or wheter they are anit-republcian and the failed the total governor test - because they hate Arn despite the fact that he has supported everything they wanted.   SO theuy are just democrats in disguise out for political power and not serious - if they were - they woiuld support arn- by the way - when are we ammending the constitution to allow for immigrants who havebeen here 20 years or so to run for US president - after the Obama administration - yeah that sounds like good timing.

India guy – 1 + 1 =3 argument - - whether democracy would spread from Iraq or not – is the middle east better with the Iraq of now or the Iraq of Sadam Husseiun – the caller is controlling the call.   And he mumbles at times and  circumnavigates – gettinjg off here and now.  Onto theoretcial and historical without application to now-  he is not applying historyu to present – jsut saayin history said this – not connecting – very sophistric.

Obama take a look in lungs and see if they're healthy-  call 1 and threat 1 for the new year- my lungs and cancer  threats before  -  smokled for 24 years – and low and behold he may not survive.  H Frank Sinatra – mob call -   caller  I swmoke – that's my right- my favorite host caller said – the host is a problem. 

never make a joke – someone will do it for real – I wish that were funny – it is too true. 

payless shoes – peopel did make fun of my shoes from payless – then I started going to walmart for those too – payless may be another “funny” comapny or have contributed – they have a store near DAM which I shopped in.    

Reeducation camps for Rush – I would not be surprised. 

There is no wainscoat in my bathrooms – and yes – the nuclear wackos witched to global warming and no one said anything.

Mark Stein – for Rush Limbaugh

yes I thought it was weird on the BBC where the BBC was discussing tony Blair's man boobs – it woudl not be discussed on US news – aussies too eh  - maybe tony blair and I have something in common. 

I have noticed that Gaza seems to be a hot plutonium chernobyl sized potato for Obama- I did notice that initially – the timing

we're

10:21 EST let's try again 1/2/09 – nope a third repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error

ho ho ho – grabbed privates or touched them and itched chin with middle, index and thumb of left hand – as I thought to wait – they threw in a  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error – to force me to quite and indeed the internet connection has stopped working.  Going to try to get at it a slightly different way – mother slammed a door jiggling my door-  just one big happy family here.   - um all American rejects is being a bit too kind and doesn't quite get what is going on – but they do raise an important issue.   This isn't miscommunication from neighbors – this is an attempt at total control and destruction of others – but we're only buying stuff and playing games-  yeah and that is the scary thing you can almost rule society buy just knowing a few games and buying stuff.  - I forgot to put a time on this – and I also will note on the restore got blasted by kfyo – some reason left the volume up -  9:35 Est 1/2/09

and they did the same error again 9:36 Est – as soon as I tried to mail a second time – on yahoo mail. Hmmm – that's odd.  I wonder if the internet connection will get severed today again?

the page count on call to arms was low by 48 pages - so there may be a book missing from the set I received as well. - I used Ravenloft Realm of Terror as a benchmark - cut outs aren't counted as pages so likely a book is missing though can't be sure with description of box's contents which the publisher did not put on the back - Ravenloft Realm of Terror - the boxed set is selling for is $3.10 used - lowest amazon price - I own that one copyright 1991 - actually mine is 1990 checking - amazon lists 1991 - the book in mine is also 144 pages so it looks like the same item.  - same #1053  - number given by publisher on my box and in amazon description – the price on the boxed set in front of me on the back is $18

my point is the updated version this boxed set – is – from the amazon listing. 

Ravenloft Campaign Setting: Core Rulebook (d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) (Hardcover) – well this one update published in 2001 -  224 pages low price of $12 – I can't but though cuurently – I believe it was higher and like $40 or something when I could buy it a week ago  - I couldn't find it a $12 when looked for it or something like this a while back and even that is high – considering other prices on other items

if they did a hanbook and a dungeon's master's guide there probably isn't a boxed set

Ravenloft: Player's Handbook (v 3.5 Core Campaign Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $35 – that is spiked – it retailed I bet for around $20 asa that is what most of hardbound books go for – can be $25 maybe $30 – but $30 should be and not a players  handbook – I don;t know on this what it retailed for at time of release – someone is spiking this price – boxeds sets and like a dungone master's guide should be roughly equiavlent in price in a series .   The new ones are $62 on amazon as low price – these books are not baseball cards – this is very odd. 

Ravenloft Dungeon Master's Guide (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying, Ravenloft Setting) (Hardcover)  - low price of $34 on new book – new is lower than a used

Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying) by Monte Cook (Hardcover - Sep 1, 2000)  low price  $3.15  - I own a copy of this now – but this book should have retailed for about what the 3.0 Ravenloft boxed set went for – the publicated dates are similar – not a decade apart- YET – the used price at amazon for one item is four times the other- 

Ravenloft is a horror series-  I just identified that as a no – no – BUT – the devil is in the details – a key point of Ravenloft is that the wicked are made lords but then punished as well – like if someone wanted to caricature  oh a famous software CEO – I don;t know what is in 3.5 – but it is spiked – and the gamma world I got -

Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas (AD&D Dark Sun Accessory) by Nicky Rea (Paperback - Jul 1996)
8 Used & new from $23.49   -  I do own this one now – similar to the amazon price – shipping not inlcuded that I paid- looked on back cover sold for $15.95 retail on the back – most dungeons and dragons go down  copyright 1996-  there wasn't much in here that was useful for my purposes – BUT – there is a story in here – it's about the creation of Athas and about how a powerful sorcer who wanted to eliminate many races from the face of the world to give it back to certain groups – it turned a forest planet into a desert – that is the one little thing that makes this book stand out – not a long book – 96 pages – I would expect $3 for this maybe $6 – but given what other D &D supplements there are – this is gets targeted – the rest of the book is on some spellcasting things – additional spells and this and that – few creatures – but nothing several different books don't contian – other books – many ohte books contain similar things-  wizard's handbook is similar..  - The history is the only thing I didn't have. 

The gamma world I bought isn't even on amazon any more – it appears -  Bil gates destroying gamma world books – ho ho ho – yes the Alternity gamma World campaign setting book – by Andy Colins and jeff Grbb – Jeff was with Gary Gygax – he has been there a while -  copyright 2000 – 192 pages or so – oh – the cover I got is there – but is not the graphic that comes up with amazon – the book is on amazon – just not with the cover I have – or that is there too – but as a backup picture – not the main one shown – there is a different cover shown -
Gamma World (Alternity Sci-Fi Roleplaying, Gamma World Campaign Setting) (Paperback)  - low price of  $24.95 – for the new book – the used ones are more expensive- odd how that happens.  - I paid  $7.65 for mine on amazon on  12/16/08 – plusa shipping -  but priced jump of 3 times in 2 weeks -

things like that can happen – but shouldn't ahppen often on amazon -

why are books important – shutting of messages – Dugneons and Dragons reads like a parable – many parables and like with defilers nad preservers – there wan't much in there to read or to use for what I want – BUT – it had a message – severe intolerance turns a desert into a forest – and it was a wizard giving a place back to the people who were there first – people in the US first-  it is a message against what is going on now- that it leads to a desert -

The Galactic Guide of Babylon5 will not have much on planet typing -  BUT IT MAY HAVE A MESSAGE  - it will talk about he different alien races and how they evolved – many of those have been worthwhile – there are messages in them -

SOMEONE IS OVERPRICING BOOKS ON AMAZON THAT CONTAIN THE WRONG MESSAGES – INTENTIONALLY SPIKING THE PRICES-  I AM A REASON TOO – BUT THAT REASON EXISTS AS WELL – KILL OFF THE SCIENCE FICTION THAT GIVES THE MESSAGE THAT CERTAIN ACTIONS BREED DESTRUCTION – WHAT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED ON MEDIA AND IN PRINT IN NEWS – GET THE LAST REMAINING SOURCE – STORIES – so that all moral conditioning is controlled-  nifty huh – the technology revolution in operation right here.  - I think the Wizards of the Coast may be writing about this one for a few years to come as well.   There is a modicum of material.   Several new Demon Lords could come out of all of this.  - and here i thought it was just a bunch of innocent role palying games.   - yawning as I am about to email – scratching back of head too – with right hand – and scratched scab with left by left side of nose.   9:25 EST 1/2/09. 





All The Ways to be Screwed Over at Amazon.com
I don't know if it – rubbed left edge of mouth with left thumb as I am about to write this – it is bad to have to be suspicious all the time and worry about little things that in the past most of the ime if I let them go they turn out to be nothing – but these days a lot of times they turn out to be something.   People are scheming and trying to be a little too clever – in short they switched products on me and tried to pass one product off as another one and used that to influence my buying habits on another product – scumbag.   I think the short version won't do – I don;t know the products before I buy them.  I ordered on amazon a boxed set of babylon 5 – there was a person selling a set for $4.95 or something  $4.75 I think or $4.79 – under $4 – the next price is $18 – on the selling list which should have been a tipoff that something could be wrong – I knew that – it was worth the risk – for that price – Because that can also be someone trying to get me a book – happened many times in the past or at least once and probably more than once – now  that pattern can be different if there is a friendly seller and a cometing hostile seller – usually there wil lbe a bidding war.   Itching right thigh with right finers -  but in this case I ordered it-  I got the product – it looked great – but there was a lot of air in the box – huge box and not much inside – it was the Revised Edtion – box says that on the cover and not the regular edition that I received- Call to arms – Babylon 5 – when I wanted to find out information for the galaxy guide of Babylon 5 it was readily available online – like I even found a site – the attic I think a premium role playing game seller-  who previewed the first five pages – there was the review that was like the 1st or 2nd item on webbrowser search list that was the review for amazon that gave it 3 stars and said it was nice but not what the person wanted unlike star trek or star wars games – just a one line review – how to tie things in – the first thing I noticed or on first inspection I noticed the box I received was priced at $50 – and it had two small books – each under 100 pages and then the cut outs for ships in it – BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF AIR IN THE BOX IT WAS PRETTY BIG AND EMPTY AND i DON'T KNOW OF A COMPANY WHO DOES THAT  - because this was $50 and only had 2 books and I ASSuMEd that they gave me the whole set of things in the box – normally when one orders an item on amazon – amazon does have a policy you can't sell incomplete items-  pages missing – so a ruelbook missing would count like that – but because the offereing was priced at $50 as a retail price on the box and I saw what was inside – I thought that maybe the galactic guide that was set to purchase was a ripoff -  BY THE WAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE JUST SHIPPED IT TO ME VERSUS PLAYING GAME AND THAT'S NOT THEM THAT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HOLD UP ORDERS I BUY AT AMAZON – YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST SO THAT A BOOK WILL ARRIVE ON A SPECIAL OCCASSION – VERSUS JUST GIVING IT TO ME WHEN I BUY IT – BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OUT – YOU JUST HOLD IT UP TO PLAY WITH – IT WAS SET TO ARRIVE JAN 9  WHEN THE ELECTORS FOR PRESIDENT READ OFF THEIR VOTES – WELL THE OTHER SIDE USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE AND CONVINCED INTO THINKING YOU HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER REASON AND IF YOU DIDN'T MUCK AROUND SO MUCH THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED-  WHEN YOU PLAY THE BIRTHDAY GAME – PAUL MCCARTNEY GETTING FREE ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF NIXON AND BLAGOJEVICH GETTING ARRAIGNED ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN – THEY USED IT AGAINST YOU HERE – AND IF i DIDN'T CATCH IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN FULLY THROUGH AND THEY STILL GOT ME TO BUY STUFF THAT THEY NOW CONTROL AND DON'T HAVE TO DELIVER- THEY REALLY TURNED IT ON YOU AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH MY ORDER YOU CHOSE TO AND I WANT TO A MAKE A BIG NOTE OF THAT ONE BECAUSE I'M NOT A FAN OF YOUR TRICK PALYING IN GENERAL AND YOU  FORCED ME INTO A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY YOU LIKE TO DO THINGS AND I DON;T CHOICE AND HERE IT SCREWED UP AND I HAD TO CATCH – WHEN YO HAVE TO MANY HIDDEN MESSAGES FLYING ABOUT THE TRICKS GET A LOT HARDER TO PULL OFF AND IT GETS EASIER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRICKS.   Itching slightly under left armpit with left index fingers.  
But it was just too easy to find exactly the information I wanted for once on call to arms – no I mean the information on the web for Babylon5 Galatic Guide – I was hoping  against hope to find a few page book preview – and I did – but it was just enough to convince me not to buy it – because it wasn't what I fully wanted – it showed the piece I was looking for and it's not what my first objective was – BUT there may be other things in the book that interest me and they oddly didn't show me that part.  But they gave me enough combined with my purchase which seemed to be very expensive for it's retails price – I only paid $5 plus shipping for the box – so I didn't feel so cheated-  but because the offering was not up to par with other books of theirs – I canceled the order for the Galactic Guide – Babylon 5 – through amazon – and I wasn't initially planning to do that-  THEY did choose to make it come Jan 9 and if they didn't pull that it would have come – probably would have been okay as an assessment and everything would have been fine – again the whoemver- government – will hold my orders so that they don;t come at a good time – or they come when something happens – but with the recent game too of – if it gets held and I didn't want it – then they want me to return it and get something else – so a hold can mean to wait or it can mean to hold(refund – actually cancel the order) – they were depending on me to know what I wanted to buy and what they pushed me to buy – the other side flipped that on them – by giving me reason to think that I had ordered something I didn't or wouldn't like and would feel it was a bad deal – and that the reason it got held was not for waiting for a date – but in order to get me to return – like I promptly and correctly with the other two books of 4th edition dungeons and dragons which looking at their peers will not make me happy – the other side caught the pattern and mimicked it and got me to take an action I didn't want to take.   And I bet supplied the used star trek books I ordered that pretty much fit the price of the babylon5 book new that I just canceld the galatic guide – and the hinted star wars and star trek and i already bought the rules for star wars.    Bit upper lip as I mentioned that.   So what happened – I tried to confirm what was supposed to be in the boxed set.  Unlike the Galatic Guide for Babylon 5 where the information I wanted popped up quickly – this time which is more usual for me I hit every dead end – movie references – there is a call to arms movie of babylon 5 – I went to yahoo shopping to find a seller – that I got a lot of junk and not the set I wanted-  I had to go back to amazon to get info this time – no info garnered that was useful on the search it turned up this time – but amazon had a page count ofor a box set – and I checked the page count of the item I ordered – against the pages I got and it is short a bit – I do not – I probably can get back to item description to see if the seller noted he was not ACTUALLY selling the item that was listed – which can happen and has happened in the past on amazon – where – they say = hey I warned you in the notes don't you read the notes-  and it's your fault for not reading the note – that this was a Spanish version veggie tales tape when you ordered fro mthe section on english version veggie tales tapes-  but it said in the notes it wasn't english – see you missed a detail – it's your fualt – versus – should have listed a spanish version tape in an english section to begin with?  -  Let me see if I can find the original description and see if the seller called out the difference.  - I don't see hwo to get back to his original description – but he sold me a different item – that from the cover looked very similar – and because that item was not as good as I expected that influenced (my decision) to cancel the other item with the additional descriptions and other information that was so readily available.   And it is the same seller who may pull the same trick – of course  I get to rate him a second time as well.  - same seller as babylon 5 faked sale.    Rubbed left side of chin with right index gienr as I wrote that.   - I was putting more books in a box – and mother woke – up – the trick on their side was to get me to order a bunch more books and have my room look messy again – because I am not getting any boxes that are very good to put books in – they're all small boxes – and mother was up in a flash – like at 6:30 or 6:00 when I figured out I could put the mail into the smaller boxes and use the remaining fairly large box for books – which neatened things up a little – and maybe it isn' by accident I haven't received any boxes for books.  I did throw one out several months back – but at the time I ahd more than enough storage capacity.  But mother was up  here and had an argument abotu the german inheritance = wanting me to fidn the address of the mayor of Shankenzell – german town where my fahter's family is from – we have not received the inheritance from my great uncle who was a POW in the USA for being a german soldier in WWII – and I think he would be rolling over in his grave if mother received the money and at what mother has done to me – and she said would use the money from Germany to buy a car.  But we shall see – the mayor of Shakenzelle controls when she gets it and she mentioned the tax that NC charges on inheritance to make (me) nervous – but as I recollect that would have been paid out of what I received or the state would have paid that.  She would have had to.   She was trying to get me to argue with her and if i went on the comptuer and looked up shankenzelle – it would tag my computer-  she does that-  she had me order for christmas last year – this book she never read – a cartoony sort of physics – book which sat on our coffee table – she also has her own computer downstairs – she could look it up – she doens;t she asks me – I declined – she wants to write the mayor to request the inheritance.   I don't wnat to dig into the emotions too much -  I could live without the money- I do grow tired of this house game where mother pretends to love me and take care of me – when she hates me and is trying to torture me that is her hope I will tire and get out.   Resting forehead on first two right index fingers (joints) at that thought and forgot about the joint part until I coughed – but I know that she is trying to be nasty enough to me to get to leave or do something that will shatter the current situation – she mentioned the taxes to make me nervous – I mentioend that above – but saying it down here made mne catch the error above.  But I woiuld appreciate it if the government wasn't too cute in ending this – if you tell me I have four years with mother and I have to watch Barack Obama screw up the coutnry-  I am trying to get prepared to deal with that.   You can even keep playing with my amazon orders and I will be more wary next time. 



wpht's audio stream links are working again – good to know 4:42 Est 1/2/09

Fireworks at 21:30 to 22:00 EST as I was going to sleep – rubbed bottom of nose of nose with left index knuckle.  The dogs were back barking loud enough so I could hear them too – and fireworks go off traditionally the night new year's eve not the night of new year's day -  again we are taking the “gives you hell” from all amreican rejects a little too literally and still with the we're going to get rid of you – not with just a we hate piece ot it. 

- education with levin – I did lose  -forgot what should go here – I bet it is not so perfect - - one thing that just came up – I do golf worse than the union memebers do.   At least the UAW ones because I ahven't played golf since 18 I think. 


businesses in CO suffered because of the “mad bomber” - let's get this straight – the whole holiday boost of sales thing is stupid and should be stopped-  but we get more money during the holidays – BUT people purchase a lot of stuff they shouldn't – don't and don't use in the absurd idea of trying to guess what someone else wants without reading his or her mind – which is crazy.  It woudl be better to do the shopping throughout the year and not encourage like a spending hangover during the holidays – it swells Christmas but starves Jan and Feb and the buldge in sales is  harder to staff and inventoryh than a more stable yearly business – why have a shot like that – we make more money-  but you do it for all the wrong reasons – and overall things would be better if it weren't done – less returns if people didin't buy at Holidays as well – and just bought when they wanted or needed something – through the year.  It works pretty well for me.   Versus – oh Christmas – gifts are good – gifts aren't good gifts suck and there are always nightmares with gifts to other people – because it never works out right- get yourself what you want with the money you'd spend on others and they can do the same – most people do have the money to do that- people who don;t are the exception to the rule- please no – “I can;t eat and have to pay the mortgage and had no money for christmas gifts for my children and I really needed others to give to me” - stories – that is not the norm.

like if everything keeps – and the entire UAW and SEIU are invovled in my case – could you like arrest all of them so that none of them could work at GM and then shut the company because it has no workers – that might be itneresting? - they'd scream – we wouldn't have a financially disfunctional company aroudn for 10 years that is “too big to fail” - it miht be an alterenative solution to resolve GM issues arrest all the workers for harassment, collusion, and racqueteering – though the prison system is probably more expensive than even a union job – but not by much and the unions are fairly criminal in some of their activities it appears to me – they do “lean” on people not to do things and that is not legal – and like murders on buses – beatings of bus drivers on buses to get their way.   Get more people to drive. 

the marines like “move along” from All American Rejects – I think although that one is good too  -my pick for explaining things would be “Gives You Hell” - one of these days we'll stop fighting – cause that is a central problem with a society – not picking one side over the other – but that not neither tolerates the other and ALOUGH ONE DOES TRY VERY HARD TO PRETEND OTHERS DON'T EXIST  - everybody knows someone is around somewhere. - looking at the ending – he got it right – but society doesn't see that yet – they ot it right – bands are teams oo I guess. 

rubbed chin as I mailed boortz.com.  Before 16:41 EST 1/1/09  16:10 maybe

Weaalth envy – listening to the guy go on about the $500,000 parkin space on boortz- not saying don't apss a law but people should do that in moderation – shouldn't be ostentatious with wealth – the way he says it does reek of wealth envy – and that he keeps putting not fiar to the middle class into his argument – that people buy $500,000 parking spaces.    And indeed even in Colorado that seems like – someone set that up just to play with people-   And to me there is an issue with actual value to society being out of line with monetary value – too many people are making too much money inflating the price of goods – that is true – weird things happen to prices on the elite scale of money and no one says anything – the $500,000 NYC studio apartment – and the people making money off of these items want the current system to continue – the issue is many people don;t profit and have to provide the actual “value” of each of those dollars – many of which have little actual value i nthe realms where they are created – in truth – capital in the stock market is totally fictitious unless you can buy real goods or saervicdes with it – but there is a disconnedct in how dolalrs are created and inflowed and outflowed and the market and how dolalrs are inflowed and outflowed in the rest of the economic system – in short people cheat like anything on the market – and actually on several markets-  real estate is an issue.  Price inflation which in some areas is not stopping.  Or is only halted.   Ca is kind of foreclosures and that money will get transfered to the banks of CA – or does it go out of state – jsut a thought – west losing power – political power and financial power – even in CA – though maybe an intrastate scam versus an interstate scam.  But back to the first point-  I am not for regulating the wealth of the rich through artificial laws – you can only be so much wealthy – nor for – rubbed  right calf with left foot – coughed – passed gas – nor for – now I forget – I will get hat(that) one though – nor for – licked lips lower lip as I got it – nor for forcing a lef(lifestyle) on wealthy – I may think about that a bit-  not force – but mka(maybe) not encourage meaningless wealth displayts(displays) – do you need 10 cars ? - you can have them but maybe there should be a tax past a point – not sure on that – a lot is wasted in wealtheir communities – for very little good reason – but I am not for telling a perosn – don;t be ostentatious – you have to live this way -   the way to fix wealth is to restructuv(restructure) how businesses are formed and how profits are distributed and the control structure – the CEO model creates the obscene wealth in US – as does the t hing where peopel don't realize they could be CEO – and the elites to control and fix that market – prevent information to publci to reduce competition for CEO jobs – there is an effort to keep dumb and ignorant which does artificdially inflate CEO pay-  and even a libertarian should agree that is an error in capitalism – more people who could be CEO should know it and compete for it – TWO – get rid of one central head like that and focus one person – that thinking will change – is chaing – freeware – it's not one perosn – it may not be fully happy and finances haven't been worked out – but it will – that model will get better products to market versus traditional comapneis – who are too fixated on making money even at the expense of thers and general public.   But reducing wealth displays to assuage middle class – that fixes nothing – the guy is basically telling them – you can do it-  jsut be secret – our society has too many secrets -  I do soemtiems buy books I read online - - Barnes and Noble said that that helped their sales – in this age – I am more used to checking out a product mnore thoroughly before buying it – I think that could yet be perfected.   It is sort of agaisnt the idea of “old capitlaism” - to allow use and thorough or more thorough testing of product – better to get the sale than to worry about customer disappointment is the theory. 

But wealthy envy is an issue – people are beign sold soemthign and do not understand what they are giving up – the military is a good candidate for unions – that is scary – speak the language of bread – uggghh – but not the language of doing but of complying – but they don't know well enough -  um if things don;t change I will soon have to delete comments@ whitehouse.gov and vicepreisdent@whitehouse.gov form the email list – he's not getting direct access to what i say at this time if ever – he tried to kill me – or had others do it for him – or did not check those who supported him who did and he is making moves to collude with them and has made his own actions in support of it with his person and his close associate – and he may be an illegal immigrant being crowned president-  which theoretically can't happen legally – and he will do something to me with the power he has – he won't play by the rules -  there was a book on Dragon empires in space – which was kept cheap  in order to – it looked like what I wanted – but it was designed to assuage me – the story line in it was designed to assuage me about Obama – and suggest it will not be the end of the USA-  I am not convienced of that- and I just passed gas on the last line – mother's foot mvoed too – can hear it – so it does appear if Obama gets power I will lsoe my freedom -    got off my intended topic and I wanted to add something else-  touched right index finger to left thumb – rubbing right calf with left foot – the middle class and class envy – people are s(not) self-satisfied which blocks much of that- on a personal level it does not bother me that Bill gates is wealthier than I am or that a parking space costs $500,000 – the waste bothers me some – but I do not desire their life – for it seems foolish – the price paid.   If more people were satisfied with what they – the wealth envy issue would go away-  moeny in most cases is not the issue – it is dissatisfaction with life-  and people get so caught up in that illusion that they do not understand.    And that gut on boortz about the parking space it seems many resent wealth.

I would probably have liked the Galactic guide of B5 that I returned  on monday when some additional information appeared out of nowhere – I hope the guides I got on star trek were worth the trade-  sharp pain in my side as I was thinking this – the price was right – I did not consider fully if what I got was a good replacement where i was looked over a small amount of the purchase fully – it is quite possible someone didn't want me to see a storyi nthe galactic guide – like I don't know – was i getting hlepd or hurt – it appeared that i was getting helped-  I got two used books for the price of a new one – and at times – beneficial deliveries have been made to me that way – But uncertain – and the door just bumped-  the background writing of the role palying game for babylon 5 is well done and a good distraction even if the galaxy guide-  the definiton of the planets is not so good-  we shall see-   because the review for that guide on amazon – mentioning what I bought in the end – prompted me to buy it -and I did not fully consider if it was not worth it – it was lower priced – that immediately draws some suspicion – again – but it could be for two reasons – one good – one bad – they do both – and much of what I bought on ebay was spiked-  the first batch – on the second – they let throuhg stuff I wanted to see – though one did not go through without a fight – they did block earlier things I wanted with high bids-  like as a gorup – I guess I will find out as things come in – itching chin and by right lip edge with right thumb and index finger.  1/1/09 15:49 EST

about to mail this one for the first time on yahoo.com – got my first  repeatingaudiostopbykillingprocesses  error  as I got to the mail page  for the new year – 1/1/1/09 15:26 Est – joy oh rapture. 

1/1/09   


FOX – early this morning you had all those beautiful picture of HI as someone is celebrating his win it appears and you are showing your support by showing the “the beauty” of HI – the “beauty” of Hi golf courses was one of interest to me-  and I have to admit – when I went to HI – I got sick and had to get an injection at the doctor in my behind – in addition – HI when I saw had bugs – there were none in the pictures – hmmm -  HI is nice but AK is nice too all depends what you like.   

On that note – Junea or Anchorage for state capital – sounds like AK is a good place to try out allowing legislators to telecommute – as well as city officials -  AND – I think a governor is saying that centers of money and power – Junea won;t give up the state capital because it loses 25% of the business  if it does – like that attitude is definitely involved in like Pittsburgh and urban and suburban discussions – where – things and power is kept downtown on purpose because even though the downtown admits at times it is not the full center – it won't give up the money or power – Chicago is similar- and Chicagoland is much bigger andm ore prominent complete with like skyscrapers in corn fields – Itasca – than suburbs of Pittsburgh  - but I think the AK governor might also be saying that yes – my East Megalopolis peers do not want to share bureacracy and pwoer with TX and with other parts of the US because it costs them money and they would scheme to keep the money – and another near deletion occurred here-  seem to be doing a string of them – I never did them before-  that is a gremlin and not a goblin isn't it-  mother – I know gremlins can play with computers too – they play with codes lines being wrong and keys touching when they're not -but they do stuff as well.  - licking upper lip-  - the east coast share power as it is not the only part of the ocuntry – hit some other odd key- shifted paragrpah and seemd to delete words – In addition I preached a node organization to cities to allow city and suburban people to better accesss the other pieces and take advantage of opportunities of both places – walmart and chicago mile – which is impossible without a car and  I don;t think super centers are allowed around Chicago.  Definitely not in Chicago – not even a walmart in Chicago – and Chicago is big and target is there at the fringe – southwest – sam's in Evansville.  - but I had more access to stores like that in Pittsburgh because of an “oversight” in their transit.  It was on the way to the airport.    Itching right thight by pelvis with right index finger -  but my node sytstem and flexible architect are what cities fight and cities fear losing with less cars – there is revenue in parking in not making parking efficient in cities -  $500,000 for a parking space in Colorado -  it's not usualy worth that much in Chicago but city parking 1 miel out of downtown was around $1200 a year to rent – for the parking.   That is not a loop price.   And someone wants that revenue – versus having a stronger and better working transit system.   So the AK governor is right- being practical is second to making money.    - In my case people seem willing to kill over it.   Touching upper lip with tongue.

for the last email – the full version 

cbs news – touched left eyebrow with right hand finger as I wanted to note the barter system and barter populatiry scares me – technically barter should be illegal as I noted before – not without using the monetary system – they are setting up a system to hedge out hyperinflation for their “friends” while other people starve and irt makes me queezy just to see it all getting set upo - 2nd CBS news story on this I have seen in recent months of online systems establishing a barter system – you cannot have an official system that does n0ot(not) use currency – it should be the equivalent of counterfeit – that is the essence of what it is – coughing as I put that up.  It may technically be legal for one person to trade with another – and technically nothing is wrong when a group does it-  BUT – they have made it official and are suing barter in exchange of money – we may need barter if we do get hyperinflation and money becomes worthless – maybe they are trying to block that by getting barter declared illegal early – bringing it up to get it struck down so that everyone suffers inflation and only black markets survive – I nearly deleted this section – the paragraph and my door bumped a little as I caught the error – and it just did a second time where my paragraph disappeared – and a hacker is probably behind that – deleting my paragraphs and hoping I won't catch it as I type merrily away and don't always look at the screen – perhaps forcing barter sites to have currency equivalents available and never allowing just a barter price – that may be one way to allow it and have it there if needed  - But not allow simply exchanges between friends -  and my door bumped again.  Bit into upper lip as I noted that 1`4:56 – total transformation ad on kfyo and a seagle circling in the space in front of the house by my window.

the new books weren't in amazon's inventory – but oddly it was advertsing them – but the new books I bought were not counted against my cash – there was an error somewhere – BUT I didn't see because the new books I bought were not coutned – the money was never deducted and no I didn't make a second check – against the checking acocunt shouldn't have had to – I sbujected from the book amoundt – assuming that came out – and each book amount was allotted for – so it should have worked – the only reason the error wasn't spotted in a nicer way was that none of the books listed at amazon were in stock – they all became out of stock as I ordered them – but there still had to be a math error or a new charrge – you did cheat – twice – you got me -  YOU CHEATEDLIKE HOLY HELL AND ON TOP OF TI WOULD NOT LET ME PURCHASE NEW BOOKS TO FIND THE ERROR -THAT WAS REJECTED TWICE – YOU MADE SURE I SPENT A FEW HOURS GETTING USED BOOKS – TO MAKE IT HURT – YO UDID WASTE MY TIME – BUT YOU CHEATED EVERY WHICH WAY – WE'RE CLEVER – WHAT IF A FRIEND REFUNDED $20 – OR STUFFED IN ENVELOPES EVERY SINGLE BOOK YOU DIDN;T SHIP ME – THAT IS JUST AS FAIR AS THE WAY YOU PLAY -

Is amazon going over to the dark side?

even boortz.com is lsow - the events are slow 1/6/09 11:52 ESt – the scroll bars – scrolling down to hit the submit is the biggest headache on boortz and on several senate sites – the up and down scroll bar stops working – you can only use the arrows and the response is delayed – 30 seconds. 

People are not happy about other people dying and losing their homes – but are only too happy to harass me – an interesting – “fair” standard -

rumbling in the area – motor not sure what ti is – can't see it – I would guess a plane -not the typical commercial plane.  11:45 EST 1/6/09

Laura Ingrahm – the coroner – how to live longer – wear gloves watch hands – well I don't – seem to be fine – and she started off with you could be a mess inside - - the internet is back on computer – bees flying into car windows – a lot of people get convertibles though.   - she is a medical examiner -  
totally ignoring and not listening to me – the patient said that or the  person – the person speaking saide that and I didn't pay attention to what she was saying and she didn't probably get to threaten in some way so at times it is good to ignore people.  True.  11:43 EST  1/6/09 – sort of sun break through the clouds – happens a lot right now. 

a pilot died at cherry point during the holidays and a marine died – and someone local may have wanted to complain to me – I think knocking off my harassment is a small thing to do – you're not supposed to do it anyway -

11:26 Internet connection at the station – the line is down – not my computer – a gift form the devils who are afraid of me getting a book about them – burning throat a little. 

Again both sides had t ocooperate to get me to screw up – I can see where the military thinks that a good lesson – you had to induce the problem – I said I don;t approve of that – I can't stop you – I don't agree with doing that as it goes to trust – you don't listen to me – or ignore what I say there – and this is a test of me – but we ahve no standing contract – the contract we have is fudged and I'm sorry – you lied and misrepresented to get what you watned – you didn't need to do this to me - - but it's not about my protection right now – it's about the test about testing me – you shouldn't really have that right without an agreement and you don't have what I feel is a valid agreement – the contract is usually spelled out when you get it = not written in invisible ink.  And to other – I screwed up – you cheated to get me to screw – with ebay – you had the people on your side not even allow the conditions to duplicate – whatever – like it doesn't count if you cheat and it looks like you cheated – didn;t balance the checkbook – but I did baloance the checkbook unless something extraordinary happened OR I made a math error and I know you were trying to get me to do that – make a small error I wouldn;t catch.  Apparently for around $30-40   and a lot of what is said on the radio are threats that I'm better ignoring than listening to – you never will say things in a way where it is clear.  It's intelligence to get our message – well I choose to ignore them and I guess I better work on whether I cross the Canadian border – Mexican border and swim out of the country – yes I normally don't go out more than 5 feet here because of what could be and is out there – it is unacceptable the deal proposed – my money is my money – if it's not it is how much it is not upfront – you don't get to direct me whrere you want – that will not be – I suspended because I thought help was needed – it is not a permanent condition.   The book should have also been availabe the first time – and you cheated there too – I wasn't allowed to get it and then I definitely had enough money – I won;t live in your country – it won't be my country -  as the military no doubt jet flies overhead 11:19 Est – you had to cheat to win – with a real opponent you may not be able to cheat – there are scenarios where you can't fix things – if you have a system structured around cheating – it could all blow up in your face in one instant.   You lose by winning.  Because of how you won.   It should have worked 3 or 4 times and you had to block and block and block.  And I could go without internet, TV, or radio for 14 more days.  Longer potentially. 

Somehow my checking account was off by $30-40 and I was balancing it the whole way – why did the $40 amazon order go through – 2 days ago -  I canceled that and bought something else-  unless the cancellation doesn;t rescind the money immediately – because last night I placed a third party order and the sales bounced most of them – but the amazon sales never bounced and what happened several times with the new sales is it would say in stock and then  be out of stock – what gives – if there was  a shortfall and I somehow made an accounting error it should have shown up with the new items ordered directly from amazon several times – but in each of those cases – even if the items were in stock – they would be taken out of stock – and I checked the last time to make sure the items were in stock – and it didn't matter once I placed the order – how did it get off – was there a charge withheld – from last month – I  know a caller made the comment on radio balance the checkbook – not balancing the checkpoint – that shouldn't have been an issue – I balanced to the check and to blanace that came in – and as there is one inflow that should have been sufficient – the only way it's not is if a charge came in from last bills – but there shouldn't be one – I shouldn;t have had to check last month because enough time was allowed for things to clear.  - the balance did say $10 last night and it didn'teven register -because I had calculated and trsuted the calculated – and you won't tell me what they did to throw it off and it is clear they planned to throw it off.   Why did amazon cooperate? - because they did – it would have been much less of a problem to loose the two items from amazon – but you wouldn't let that happen – every order I placed with amazon – i placed like 3 orders for amazon things-  and none of them were there  and the last time – I checked availability first – and the items disappeared when I ordered them – what gives is amazon hositle? - Why are you making a deal with them – unless you plan to kill me too – and everything is fine – this was an experiment and now you kill me – I could see that – because that couldn't have occurred without cooperation – why does that keep happening where you blantantly cooperate with the other side – I don;pt understand that took time up – and you meant to waste my time and make shop and you knew you'd take it all away.  Fuck you  -there is a reason – whatever – so neither one of you may help me in the end – and everything didn't happen or something – what am I to make of this – this is another one where both of you cooperated to go at me – I'm not changing – kill me then – If yo uwon;t give me the rules and let me make decisions – I didn't give to churches in the past – and definitely – I came to the conclusion that charity has its time and it is not every time and I don't think its now – and yo uare again changing the rules-  nothing is said it is done and I find that unfair – like the rules are never the rules there are additional rules-  no one like playing a role playing game like that – where the DM – actually paranoia is based on that- but in normal role playing – that is what breaks out the arguments and the frustrations is the when the DM – well I didn;t want you to go there so – I kind of changed things – it's not a game if the DM always wins – or has perfect control – and you are no longer playing a fair game with  - not having bus fair in Pittsburgh with the full groceries and thinking I had it – I don't approve and at some point you will need my help and i may not cooperate – because you like just forcing me to do what you wantand that's not how it's to work. 

Herr Strauss – prat on TX – again he does nto sound super ethical and I wish there were someone else-  he is not the governor and he is not in fully control and he can be managed – and letting him voice opposition opinion may be good for TX even if he is sleezeball – or sounds like it.  - he will hang himself if he is a sleezeball.

wizards don'tgenerally build bunkers when they can create antoher dimension to go into – and with Barack Obama I think I may need to go into another dimension he would go after my bunker.  -

1/6/09 -8:35 EST – computer is slow on internet – like last night – despite measure to alter – a little slow to get to new sites .

Thinking Deeper Then Polar Bears and Cow Methane Generation in 2009 – I Hope Anyway

Mis country tis of thee sweet land of liberty – say what ? - you can't sing that here fool - it violates the noise ordinance, besides your not part of the professional singers unions os you cna't sing outdoors – gonna find ya and bringyou in for a psychiatric evaluation – you should know better. 

Another Villian in the Online Mist
much of what I got from amazon is perfectly scammed – t olook useful – but hedge a little unuseful where possible – one thing did slip through and despite their efforts – I will draw some use out of what I purchased – but they tried to scam it all and I would wonder if eve ntheat buyer on ebay – his timing is bad – the things I might have gotten from him that would be most helpful or would have been positive without question were not up for bid when I had money – when I had the least useful stuff was up for bid and much of what I got from the first batch which is the best timed for me to bid on – wasn't so useful – I  looked in fartherand found other things – and was outbid on all of them – and they did push me over which works with not outbidding the rest of ebay – but most of those things although the topics covered were as desired – they were light on charts and heavy on things that may not have  been as useful – the title was deceptive to the content – or the content wasn't precisely what was hoped for – in the recent batch – someone figured out that the way to be least helpful when searching for new gaming systems – was to give me two new games – star wars and star trek – who basically lifted their system from d20 and relied more on the movie title to sell the book than the game mechanics – both have some inspiration – but neither – with star wars I was hoping for a system used to deal specifically with the force like psionics in dungeons and dragons – they turned more into indvidual spells being cast – which doesn;t capture the idea of two jedi battling – and it imitates other things I already have access to – and amazon cooperated to a large degree – not allowing me many of the books I ordered and encouraging me to get the fourth series which I will try to return – I may be too late – but which is nto very useful – so very few of the high tech people have ethics – even amazon would rather kill me – because they helped – they wouldn;t let me get new books – they suddenly became out of order so they wouldn't arrive in certain cases the back order date kept increasing.   I couldn't get extreme paranoia-  like I thought that was other poeple doing things like that – because they do things like that – like make a special book arrive on a certain day – which means when two books came together – John McCain's and the navy seals in an amazon box – that was amazon doing that – not John McCain – amazon is like netflix – so every  one of the key websites for young people is controlled by a dark side power who favors Obama and will tip their website towards Obama.   Well another turncoat revealed – I wonder if there are any more.  The book or video on mccain and the book on the navy were ordered in 2007 and not very close together – so it was odd to get them on a similar day. 

and I do remember who was called chiapet and what that referes to. 

well instead of driving me out of high school which was tried they feel justified in friving me out of the country – and the vice principal seems to be asleep this time – to the person who felt justified in destroying someone who preached a different system of government that might be a threat to the current government- of course the US government came out of precisely condition – democracy was dreamed up first it appears in the French and Possibly British Monarchies and would probably be equally as heretical in that time period as anything I say today.  Perhaps you would have killed off John Locke and Richeleu and the philosophs who came up with the idea for a US style democracy – they were a threat to the monarchs – should they have died?  Should they have been hounded to death  - perhaps because the new democracy in the US does not seem to believe in democracy at all anyway. 

Obama putting the budget online – AND letting the activist groups directly supervise congress – ARRRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! - the activists are the one who that will help. 

Seeing as the audio stream stopped as I thought the winning thought to this thought stream 15:51 Est – and I wasn't touchingthe keyboard so there was no good reason – but it was “highly coincidental it stopped with a throught stream like last time” -   we seemed to have this conversation -
You should have  been paying attention to your checking account and blaancing it -
Yeah but normally amazon deducts when you buy stuff -versus with me it didn't deduct like 4 -5 times in that last foray which is what screwed me up and that doesn't happen. 
But it could happen and you should have planned for it – statement close to this
Yeah but beheadings on greyhound happen too and I don't them when I take a trip on greyhound because they aren't really accidental – and right at that thought it stopped – the audio stream stopped. 

cia commercial disrupted by sound silence a first 15:54 EST

Somehow my checking account was off by $30-40 and I was balancing it the whole way – why did the $40 amazon order go through – 2 days ago -  I canceled that and bought something else-  unless the cancellation doesn;t rescind the money immediately – because last night I placed a third party order and the sales bounced most of them – but the amazon sales never bounced and what happened several times with the new sales is it would say in stock and then  be out of stock – what gives – if there was  a shortfall and I somehow made an accounting error it should have shown up with the new items ordered directly from amazon several times – but in each of those cases – even if the items were in stock – they would be taken out of stock – and I checked the last time to make sure the items were in stock – and it didn't matter once I placed the order – how did it get off – was there a charge withheld – from last month – I  know a caller made the comment on radio balance the checkbook – not balancing the checkpoint – that shouldn't have been an issue – I balanced to the check and to blanace that came in – and as there is one inflow that should have been sufficient – the only way it's not is if a charge came in from last bills – but there shouldn't be one – I shouldn;t have had to check last month because enough time was allowed for things to clear.  - the balance did say $10 last night and it didn'teven register -because I had calculated and trsuted the calculated – and you won't tell me what they did to throw it off and it is clear they planned to throw it off.   Why did amazon cooperate? - because they did – it would have been much less of a problem to loose the two items from amazon – but you wouldn't let that happen – every order I placed with amazon – i placed like 3 orders for amazon things-  and none of them were there  and the last time – I checked availability first – and the items disappeared when I ordered them – what gives is amazon hositle? - Why are you making a deal with them – unless you plan to kill me too – and everything is fine – this was an experiment and now you kill me – I could see that – because that couldn't have occurred without cooperation – why does that keep happening where you blantantly cooperate with the other side – I don;pt understand that took time up – and you meant to waste my time and make shop and you knew you'd take it all away.  Fuck you  -there is a reason – whatever – so neither one of you may help me in the end – and everything didn't happen or something – what am I to make of this – this is another one where both of you cooperated to go at me – I'm not changing – kill me then – If yo uwon;t give me the rules and let me make decisions – I didn't give to churches in the past – and definitely – I came to the conclusion that charity has its time and it is not every time and I don't think its now – and yo uare again changing the rules-  nothing is said it is done and I find that unfair – like the rules are never the rules there are additional rules-  no one like playing a role playing game like that – where the DM – actually paranoia is based on that- but in normal role playing – that is what breaks out the arguments and the frustrations is the when the DM – well I didn;t want you to go there so – I kind of changed things – it's not a game if the DM always wins – or has perfect control – and you are no longer playing a fair game with  - not having bus fair in Pittsburgh with the full groceries and thinking I had it – I don't approve and at some point you will need my help and i may not cooperate – because you like just forcing me to do what you wantand that's not how it's to work. 

Herr Strauss – prat on TX – again he does nto sound super ethical and I wish there were someone else-  he is not the governor and he is not in fully control and he can be managed – and letting him voice opposition opinion may be good for TX even if he is sleezeball – or sounds like it.  - he will hang himself if he is a sleezeball.

wizards don'tgenerally build bunkers when they can create antoher dimension to go into – and with Barack Obama I think I may need to go into another dimension he would go after my bunker.  -

1/6/09 -8:35 EST – computer is slow on internet – like last night – despite measure to alter – a little slow to get to new sites . 

star registry -commercial kfyo – one of the guys when I was in temporary labor for 2 days – the first day the guy who was my boss – had a star registry thing in his car.  - but he and the other one -gave the pittsburgh story of being hand to mouth and sick and have to keep going – and I now realize that was a line – it was Pittsburgh's way of pushing me away from what i was doing which would have potentially  hurt their plans.  Even a small amount of income – would have been hard for them to control so they gave me the worst jobs to discourage me from taking more -and that was planned – like spanish – the argentinian non-credit spanish teacher – they moved to break my connection with her-  they did the same with temporary labor so they could control me better.

Mark Levin – I should hear the whole show – of 1/5/09 still missing a few minutes in the middle but two main threads of thought where a gauntlet goes down -

I do feel a bit – I used the anology of a trapper keeper or there was something similar from meade where a gorilla was i9n the commercial and he stomped and and tried to tear it up and then after all that used it – I fell kind of like – oh a little tickle in throat – we are in the morning – th's addressed- it got me to think about carrying the packages that came yesterday up the stairs in my right arm – nd the joints were oddly in pain – we do keep down the meat I have – it's never red meat – it's white or turkey and it is – Ican only have os much of it – she only puts a portion out never serves the whole much of the time and she is doing sauces – tomato sauce doesn't make it that often – and I know they are trying to get me sick – we couldn't let me had all the vitamins – like we didn't let me buy that a while back – like the books at amazon where they just go out of stock if you don't want me to buy them – I tried to buy something really high in nutrients – and you wouldn't let me get it – geting onto other thoughts and  getting farther away from topic – could discuss classical music – or issues with dinner-  I will note that the classical CD from walmart arrived yesterday – it is scratchy – skips quite a bit – and something seems wrong with it on day 1 – it does play currently – I am not overly fond of the selections – the one that i thought i would like for sure which was the reason I got the Cd – that dirge is normally done in heavy organ music and this CD has a much lighter feel to a dirge which highly inappropriate-  much weaker – someone got rid anytthing in walmart for $1.88 that would appeal to me I have a feeling – because I was struggling and this was a compromise – I knewthat getting it – but even this – the key part is messed up – a dirge that is played more like a lullaby – someone manipulated so that I would get very little I wanted to hear at home.   - I had criticism – with the scary sounds- actually mother gave it to me – I guess I'll write fast – it got – I may have thrown it out – something happened to it – but I had a tape of scary soudns where the sounds did a very good job of painting a picture of a story – it took you very well from outside a haunted by sound to inside to different scenes in the haunted house and there was organ music in the house that got louder and louder and at the end of the tape you were in the room with the organ music and the house exploded – witches cackling and the regular-  but all around that theme – I ahve been looking for something ever since 2004 – and I have not found it – the organization of the sounds and the way you can imagine the various scenes and there is a point to the sounds placed that makes the tape – classical music suffers from this – repeating patterns – there is no strong story many times – not every time – but many times – there's only a melody that doesn't repeat for a minute – versus a constantly changing melody throughout the song- modern songs – may nto change melody throughout – but the words change and thus it is always new in some part – classicla doesn;t have words – unless you include opera.   Carmina Burana – does change throughout.   The moonlight sonata changes a lot as well and builds well – at least through a movement which is enough – it doesn't really build movement to movement.  - done with music – I am worried how my “doctor” will affect my long term health with the nutrition and knowing she is trying to control what I eat – and what nutrients get in my body.   I sort of keep a can of the pizza sauce – tomatoes that I know tastess pretty good by me as a ward against mother dearest – that if she fights hard this way – I have one thing left- touching forehead to first two right index figner joints- 
I realize that the constant questions are not necessarily meant for discussion they are meant to make me feel like a beat up suitcase and the constant presure is kept up by manyt people not to be honest – but just to win through wearing me down – it does take away energy from other things – and I won't hide that that bothers me – that being the punching bag to prevent the mob from getting to castle freankenstien and killing the scientist and creation is not what I wanted.  Mother might be up – or the friendly devils are starting their morning bombing practice  - fur elise is growing on me – as their is some complexity – still was looking for an encore to the moonlight Sonata #3 – and that is not here – I guess mother was and I spoke to her early this morning so what will happen to me innards now that she has that-  I usualy try not to speak to her till dinner time – somehow I have less issues in my body that way-  I left one thing above – I wonder if people could n't make soundscapes-  of mvoing through a farm – a factory – an office – the day at work – a thunderstom- a montage I guess of sound – but one to illustrate an experience – to educate through the sounds heard what a life is like- computer science might even be interesting.  - a thought – mother did just speak with me 6:13 EST – I took a little vitamin C for my sore throat and until mother spoke with me – I bet I wans't gettingsick today – now she will work on it all day. 

Not getting on to the important things – the two points presented for argument – stopping to put a blanket on as I get to them and notice my side is cold so I am shifting – before I need to go to the bahtroom which will come let me try to write.

The first point – is that if you take away traditional worship – some seem to have concluded that inevitably leads to failure – Mark Levin was arguing that both fascism and socialism rejected God and that others feel that is what happens when you reject God – I will leave out most physical signs while typing – the toes -  the are doing distractions so i ahve to fight that – but that is the basic argument if you leave out God you get a failed state – some people are not fully honest that they like people to fear God and leave that myth of god because they are easier to manipulate and won't seek fully to understand and deduce out what is going on behidn the scenes if it is just God and God just can do things.   Certain people like to use that to exploit people, and they use that to control people through church – neither a worthy objective.  But both yes Karl Marx is ocrrect perhaps in saying that in truth religion is an opiate of the masses – to a large degree – that blind faith without any understand – I don't support that – blind with understanding is something that I support, but Marx is correct that religion can be an opiate to the masses and definitely I don't like the way the other side likes people so fully deluded that they make illogical choices which the other side likes because it keeps the 2 tiers of society as they are – which is the intention.  - got off thinking of changing the music – 6:27 – but that socialism will lead to destruction – how much different is libertarianism from socialism – getting off shouldn't bring uop that thought – but there is nothing wrong – in ideal – with trying to provide needed resources to people and correcting the abuses of capitalism – there is nothing in that ideal- and yes – that gets me on a tact into thoughts I don;t want to do right now – I was going to say socialism may be like the light bulb – where the system isn't right and something else needs to be looked at – not state run – I have to think on it-  the first version of our constitution failed too though – as a reminder – the Us was not an automatic success story – and the issues in the US system are there and saying it can't get any better than this – that is bunk -  but I wanted to note – to toally blow up this argument – that Sadam Hussein had essentially a Fascist state and instead of running from religion  HE EMBRACED RELIGION – religion works well and that need to go to church can be used well in a fascist state if the state runs the church or controls it.  The South used the church with slaves to teach obedience ortried to use it that way.  It was a source of freedom because the wrong bible passages got used – but the Southerners tried to correct for that and essentially Hitler was Smarter and Hussein was smarter – they never read the wrong bible passages – just kept in the people's ears what they wanted to hear- yes we can,  yes we can – But i can definitely say that religious fascism works well – but that was Isalm Christianity could never do that – oh boy – what about the forming of the Protestant religions in Europe during the reformation or enlightenment – 1800s isn't it or 1700's actually Napolean's era.   Euroep has a lot of history – we're getting to Israel – that's next question.   Catholicism had a brush or two of being totalitarian and being corrupt in its past.  And yes kids – perhaps you should ask the mormons whether the other protestant religions are not capable of making a totalitarian state – isn't there a reason the mormons went to Utah. 

Okay second part ofthe first qeustion socialism – well that didn't work – next – but what can we learn? - that if turn off belief blindly and there is no replacement that that does not work  -I am not proposing that and I am not proposing socialism the way it was – I want to hold on my proposal – not hold back- I haven't fully formed it – I like and see the need for a market or the use for one – but clearly – i feel that social customs are changing because of education and that – they are trying to make me forget – that there it is – that the modern systems are too good at fooling the market – that is being so fully demonstrated right now it isn't funny – you're not supposed to be able to do censorship via good pricing  in capitalism – unless there is a sincere need – but you're not supposed to be able to take an idea off a capitlist market – and with the dungeons and dragons price fixing thing – you are trying to – yo uare trying to now stifle in role-playing with me-  is this what you did to art and do to music -  YOU ARE BY YOUR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THAT CAPITALISM IS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REGULATE YOUR BEHAVIOR  - the market was there to equalize and to allow exchange of products – it was not there to be a vehicle by which to deny products – and while it is clear others are fighting back – you can effectively deny me a book or two – and put them way out of my price range – and deny me their contents in my studies – which means you can do it with anything and you are trying to set up that system – where price controls who gets access to what knowledge.   NO – this shows that the US version of capitalism needs modification more than anything else – this display that has been put on.    I do not have an example of God in socialism – but it could be – clearly in Ravenloft – they propose an example of socialism with religion – Zakata – I would have to look – there is a cleric that rules one of the terror domains – and you redistribute crops – and you starve a family member as part of the religion – it is a horror thing – but the proposal could be feasible as socialism system with religion – noyt the starvation though humans do a lot of crazy thngs in real life – but the use of God to encourage socialism – Jesus and the early Catholics there is that passage – they weren't super capitalists - - let me find the ravenloft reference -  in Ravenloft the example is G'Henna is the land the lord of it is Yagno Petrovna – it's a myth but a clear example of how a scoialist systrem could work with the church as a center – and there are real examples – the puritans did socialism – the US puritans – I was going to look at Buddhism and India where Brahins are above princes in the social hierarchy – but no the puritans suffice – the purtians did a socialist system based on religion – we had socialism in the US – but it didn;t work – AH but that doesn't matter to the proof – socialsim isn;t perfect in Europe either-  the question was not whether socialism worked – but whether not beloieving in God lead to socialism – I have given counterexamples where believing in God not only may not protect you from socialism or fascism  - BUT instead religion is an excellent enhancer of both socialism and fascims and  KEEPING PEOPLE BELEIVING THINGS THAT ARE NOT LOGICAL AND KEEPING THEM IN A STATE WHERE THEY DO NOT QUESTION I BELIEVE IS MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOCIALIST OR FASCIST STATE -  the land of strawberry short cake or caillhou – everything is perfect.  There is no evil. 

Oh boy and that is question one – and now question – poor jews – I kind of want this one to be quick so – I will address directly 

Muslims are Islamo-Nazis who want to kill everyone including all other nations – I do nto think this ids what they want – I don't bin Laden and Hamas are the same person or belief system – same with Iran – I do not know there belief system  - in general Arab culture feels that Madonna and encouragement of homosexality – encouragement of pronography of drugs of sex of rich and poor through lending money – Isalm teaches and feels that this situations which arise in the west are evil from what I udnerstand  it views the freedom of women as perhaps a reason for the coming immorality that is sees i nthe west -  IF I HAVE IT RIGHT – IT'S ARGUMENTS ARE NOT SO DISSIMILAR FRO MCONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS SECTS IN THE US  - Isalm wants to wipe out what it sees as evil – We do not seem to want to take a critical look at what our style of capitlaism has encouraged in our culture and not look at that some things we do are nto so defensible – Isalm is saying we have a better solution – our way is better – that may not be true – but they have an objection to our culture and instead of answering it – wesay they are terrorists for not wanting to be caught up in our culture and we are ignorant of the idea that our culture affects them and their children – in honesty the Islamic fundamentalist argument against the US – is the much different than the Christian fundamentalist argument against me – or Pittsburgh's argument against me – though I am trying to address yo+ur concerns – you instead send an army to suppress the muslims – there was some good intent – the US military -many of its memeber do not love te muslims – or even toelrate them with equality – and definitely to the military the thought eradicate the threat to the US – versus needing to win a discussion – most of the US will not have that discussion with Islam which is what will end the war – you have to separate the true terrorists from the people who believe we are evil through hopefully ignorance -  THOUGH I AM STARTING TO WONDER ON THAT POINT -  you are not showing the best side of our tolerant democracy with me – there is some terror for terror's sake – bin Laden can hoenstly claim – you didn't listen to anything else and the peaceful people weren't getting through to you – it took blowing up the world center to get your attention in any menaingful way to that we have concerns you are wrong nad you are affecting our children – and looking into my homeland -  THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT A CORRUPT CULTURE WHICH ALLWOS THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY AREN'T THERE SOME OF YOU BILLIONAIRES WHO MADE MONEY OFF THE HOUSING CRISIS – and I forgot the next thought – but something like – we are having objections from our society to look into cleaning it up and addressing some of the issues – I had a stronger point – but it was along those lines – and we do need to address apaprently fairly large corruption – many US people who opted for a corrupt system as long as they get a good job.  Needed to clean nose all the sudden – but there are oddly issues – ah – I was going to say above – the issues that have turned up have proved Bin Ladin partially right that there is corruption and there are problems in western culture – the yes we can  . . . . destroy all your liberty movement is not proving Bin Laden wrong.  I knwo I should take a southern attitude and just disagree without being disagreeable and not discuss it like has been done for several decades which has led to this wondrous position we are currently in .  It is going to be cool turning the internet connection  back on  and you have to read al lthis – contemplating the music – you can have complexity in a softer way in music –this morning it works – but normally I want it a little faster – more complicated – got into a loop – mental loop – rubbed back of head iwht right hand as I realizedthat.  7:20 EST

Now the poor Jews part from Mark Levin
Arabs keep all their land – we never get our land-  I have to check census – there are a lot more arabs than jews – for recorded history they have always been in that region after Mohammed and those events took place -  THAT IS HOW THINGS WOUND UP -  they were occupied too – they did not keep Austria which is where the Ottoman empire used to extend to.  - it might be interesting to look up why constantinople fell and became Istanbul – like the other Christians acted kind of like people are acting now and allowed a tragedy to occur.  Rome and Italy and Russia were disinterested fro what I remember of history and would not aid Constantinople in staying alive.  - mother asked if she could takethe package to the post office for me – demonstrating myh inability to do basic things without assistance.   Ant got in a loop and rubbed top of head as I got out of it.  In History the jews have not been in Israel before 1950 ish for many hundreds of years I beleive – Israel was a state that ceased to exist – we ahve a bibilical claim – or a claim in the torah to ti – we were there – like should Ares and Mars and Jove be the principle religion of Israel – it is history – it wasn't a current claim in 1950 – in addition owning land was invented in the UK in 1700s wasn't it – the jews were in Israel in the past – and come back to Israel – saying it had to be theirs by a biblical claim on the land – we don't really want to start doing that – because like the Aztecs would demand mexico – the Pequots would demand CT – other indian US tribes would demand a lot – Europe would be a mess again – should the British reconquer Britanny isn't it inf France – the stuff the 100 years war was about?  - The jewish claim to Israel in 1940 or whatever was not any stronger than that-  Arabs havne't been fully better treated – they lost different wars and had a different history with their land than the jews and the jews chose not to have a coutnry elsewhere – that was a choice – it had to be Israel – uggghh0-  that is not what the plymouth rock pilgrims chose.   And yes I do not recognize the torah nor the bible nor the Qu'ran – there is a new spelling – as legal documents or unchangeable rationales – jews don't recognize mecca as sacred – but Islam says it is so – Is Rome not holy? - BUT – with a country you do ask for international recognition and that is not done in a religious text – but that is the claim of Israel – or how it started -   Mark mentioned 500,000 jews thrown off land – by Arabs – I don;t knwo the time period on that – And 500,000 comapared to what – how many were in Palestine? - there are 400,000 in Gaza in addition to the disruption to egypt – Iraq – again I identified the middle east as one of two big poweder kegs on the world surface – for the US – China and then the middle east -  INDIA AND PAKISTAN WITH LIKE 1 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ARE LESS OF A PROBLEM I THINK – CONSUME LESS TIME AT THE STATE DEPEARTMENT THAN ISRAEL  - you decided to uproot people from the land they were currently living on and force them into a state where you were dominat – and did so on a biblical claim – claim of a religious – the pope of the past tried with the crusades – it didn't work out so hot.  Weren't the arabs there in 1000 AD ? - like it was the Christians against the Arabs.  The arab people and religion made different choices – where they made good ones they made out -  where they didn't things happened – perhaps certain ideas in Judaism have not led to the most successful society and that is the cause of past troubles -

The world hates us – I really didn't shout this – but there is a sense – I definitely have gotten this in spades – there is this -  NONE OF YOU MATTER THIS IS VAT OUR HOLY TEXT SAYS WE SHOULD DO AND WE WILL DO IT – AND NONE OF YOUR BELIEFS OR YOUR VALUES MATTER – WE WILL PRETEND TO LISTEN NICELY AND THEN DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY  - WE ARE THE CHOSEN OF GOD – YOU ARE NOT  -  that doesn't go over too well with the neighbors – that like in the end their beliefs are crap and you have no intenion of respecting any of them – it does come out – I realize these days not every jew feels the way of the above statement – but it is there – I had a jewish boss tell me he was not jewish enough because a baptisement in Israel is worth more than one done in the US – that is scary to me as a concept.  And it is not based on a rational belief – religious beliefs are not always rational – Shiite muslims – and the suffering for their cleric who died in that ceremony where they cut their scalps – the jews just believe their religious text – words a jew wrote down for eternity entitle them to a piece of land in Asia I guess technically – ya know in several million years it will all be lava ? - what then?    Will the jews occupy Israel when it is molten rock or as it falls into the earth ? - it happens in time – rubbed face with left hand like 5 lines up .  Scratching privates – nearly got into a loop -  

it is hard in this century to deal with customs based in relgiion – sacred burial rights on ski slopes in CO – no I am not a full fan and some time in the future – those lands may be less sacred – it is not rational – for now – we don't need them – would any of the indian tribes ever explore rejoining the  US?   Canada and the US may join before that happens.  I will not force that – just saying it is not the jews who are the only who do odd things because of religion – okay okay – you didn;t have to mention worshipping a guy getting Roman corporal punishment – and yes believing not so good tasting white wafers are flesh and a communal cup of wine is blood – I hear some protestants serve grape juice instead  - but yes – Christians are general cannibals and practice cereonially eating the flesh and blood of christ at every mass and we supposedly believe we are doing that-  I should say they – I did it for a while – stretched atrms and both hands came down on top of head.  I was thinking at the time – the issue with religion is osme people like how it effectively controls people – you have to go to mass or are supposed to  - and it allows certain people to watch you and see you a lot in a predictable pattern – like I don't have to deal with that and more you can't see me get at me -  I go out as needed – no perfect scheudle – a caller on beck was saying I would destroy their way of life preach osmething ocutner to it – weren't the same arguments done with mormons – I don;t mean to keep using them – but yeah  they have some of the same issues – where the majority decides they cannot exist.  There was a realyl nasty kind of – he is saying something that will destroy our way of life and that of our children – shouldn't we kill him and stop him – phrased so they wouldn't get in trouble – but it was there. 

So perhaps demeanor hurt the jews over time, perhaps just the way events played out.  In any case god doesn;t give fully nfair shakes – you make your choices and he responds.  Maybe one day she who knwos- not right now though.   She is trying to become God by getting rid of God.   History occurred and there are reasons things happened – the Muslims did different things than the jews did and wound up in a different place.

I was wondering how an innocent reading commercial to children from the ad council could be corrupt – because they they liked to show it to me – encouraging children to read in realms of fantasy – it then struck me that as a child – being exposed to real knowledge in physics and history and other subjects is probably the true power of books and by pushing the reading campaign to children into fantasy they are blunting the useful education they could receive-  I did touch my forehead to my right index finger joint.  And now rubbing forehead – with back of left hand - - remembering other things I could do – on kfyo -listener progrma – rubbing my nostril  with left index kncukle – touched pinky of right hand while curled to back of left hand by thumb- but they stopped showing me ads on hulu.com once I figured – even childrne's reading is spiked to be negative – or towards the overall goal of making people stupid – it is not good to see the coordinated effort – can arrest most of the bureaucrats in DC?

Mis country tis of thee sweet land of liberty – say what ? - you can't sing that here fool - it violates the noise ordinance, besides your not part of the professional singers unions os you cna't sing outdoors – gonna find ya and bringyou in for a psychiatric evaluation – you should know better.

much of what I got from amazon is perfectly scammed – t olook useful – but hedge a little unuseful where possible – one thing did slip through and despite their efforts – I will draw some use out of what I purchased – but they tried to scam it all and I would wonder if eve ntheat buyer on ebay – his timing is bad – the things I might have gotten from him that would be most helpful or would have been positive without question were not up for bid when I had money – when I had the least useful stuff was up for bid and much of what I got from the first batch which is the best timed for me to bid on – wasn't so useful – I  looked in fartherand found other things – and was outbid on all of them – and they did push me over which works with not outbidding the rest of ebay – but most of those things although the topics covered were as desired – they were light on charts and heavy on things that may not have  been as useful – the title was deceptive to the content – or the content wasn't precisely what was hoped for – in the recent batch – someone figured out that the way to be least helpful when searching for new gaming systems – was to give me two new games – star wars and star trek – who basically lifted their system from d20 and relied more on the movie title to sell the book than the game mechanics – both have some inspiration – but neither – with star wars I was hoping for a system used to deal specifically with the force like psionics in dungeons and dragons – they turned more into indvidual spells being cast – which doesn;t capture the idea of two jedi battling – and it imitates other things I already have access to – and amazon cooperated to a large degree – not allowing me many of the books I ordered and encouraging me to get the fourth series which I will try to return – I may be too late – but which is nto very useful – so very few of the high tech people have ethics – even amazon would rather kill me – because they helped – they wouldn;t let me get new books – they suddenly became out of order so they wouldn't arrive in certain cases the back order date kept increasing.   I couldn't get extreme paranoia-  like I thought that was other poeple doing things like that – because they do things like that – like make a special book arrive on a certain day – which means when two books came together – John McCain's and the navy seals in an amazon box – that was amazon doing that – not John McCain – amazon is like netflix – so every  one of the key websites for young people is controlled by a dark side power who favors Obama and will tip their website towards Obama.   Well another turncoat revealed – I wonder if there are any more.  The book or video on mccain and the book on the navy were ordered in 2007 and not very close together – so it was odd to get them on a similar day. 

and I do remember who was called chiapet and what that referes to.

if you legalize marijuana – and create amarket – there would be less incentive to steal microchips -oh wow – which helps the profit margin of silicon valley.

-texas heart institute pursues expansion into China-  NOOOOoooooooo – Chian and healthcare – China has its fingers in very nasty things- it is heavily invovled in a lot of problems-  - ti was involved in my case – in PA and NC – do not mix our healthcare with Chinese doctors – they did that in Pittsburgh – you too can be anesthesiatized only to the point where you are paralyzed and conscious so the doctor can open you up and you cannot scream – but you cannot let him knowyou are awake – yopu know the poison toys and stuff – passing wind as I write this

well instead of driving me out of high school which was tried they feel justified in friving me out of the country – and the vice principal seems to be asleep this time – to the person who felt justified in destroying someone who preached a different system of government that might be a threat to the current government- of course the US government came out of precisely condition – democracy was dreamed up first it appears in the French and Possibly British Monarchies and would probably be equally as heretical in that time period as anything I say today.  Perhaps you would have killed off John Locke and Richeleu and the philosophs who came up with the idea for a US style democracy – they were a threat to the monarchs – should they have died?  Should they have been hounded to death  - perhaps because the new democracy in the US does not seem to believe in democracy at all anyway. 

Obama putting the budget online – AND letting the activist groups directly supervise congress – ARRRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! - the activists are the one who that will help. 

Seeing as the audio stream stopped as I thought the winning thought to this thought stream 15:51 Est – and I wasn't touchingthe keyboard so there was no good reason – but it was “highly coincidental it stopped with a throught stream like last time” -   we seemed to have this conversation -
You should have  been paying attention to your checking account and blaancing it -
Yeah but normally amazon deducts when you buy stuff -versus with me it didn't deduct like 4 -5 times in that last foray which is what screwed me up and that doesn't happen. 
But it could happen and you should have planned for it – statement close to this
Yeah but beheadings on greyhound happen too and I don't them when I take a trip on greyhound because they aren't really accidental – and right at that thought it stopped – the audio stream stopped. 

cia commercial disrupted by sound silence a first 15:54 EST

my browser slow across all websites - all events are slowed down - Rahm Emanuel - universal civil defense training - the issue is the way they are doing it is that it is not voluntary but mandatory and it will be used as a social control - the military is a place to test out people - you can control their envrionment - in a gremlin's hands that is deadly - NO - they will find the strong people and kill them if not aligned- Voldermort running Horgwarts - controlling any upstarts.

Sean – talking about living throuhg Carter years – with a relatively young male voice – he is giving a clue to age – technically I lived through the Carter years – even if I don't remember it.
