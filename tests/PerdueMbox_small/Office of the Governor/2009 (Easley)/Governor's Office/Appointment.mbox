Dear Governor Easley,

I understand you were interviewed last week by a local television station regarding tornado warning systems and other severe weather notification capabilities. I was traveling and missed the broadcast, but was told you talked about siren based solutions. Additionally, I read several articles in the News and Observer where you expressed a genuine interest in indentifying solutions that help protect people and their property in our state. One such article written recently by Martha Quillin, “Radios best bet against twisters” (http://www.newsobserver.com/print/sunday/city_state/story/1306204.html) was particularly interesting.

This article stated that information provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will help protect lives and property and that everyone should buy a NOAA radio. That will only help if you’re sitting next to the radio in a time of need. I am a founder and Chairman of the Board at a RTP based start-up company Velleros, Inc. At Velleros, we believe there is a better way to get this critical and time sensitive information to people in harms way. Velleros has created a carrier grade mass alerting and notification application that enables telecom carriers to reliably notify their subscriber customers of time-sensitive events such as tornados, tsunamis, severe thunderstorms, child abductions, chemical spills, civil emergencies, and product recalls. With regard to the weather alerting capability, Velleros polls NOAA every few seconds and can send customized voice or text messages to multiple end devices such as mobile phones, land lines and computers in the form of voice calls, emails, pop ups or text messages just to mention a few. Because it’s customizable, the Velleros platform can be configured to call you and wake you in the event of eminent danger from threatening weather by ringing your mobile and/or home telephone(s).

In addition to the weather service alerts and notifications, Velleros provides community-based notification features that enable Universities and State-and-Local Governments to reliably notify their respective communities of emergency situations or other time sensitive and important information. Velleros’ alerting and notification applications are also planned to be compliant with requirements for a new capability mandated by U.S Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Commercial Mobile Alerting System (CMAS). CMAS is based on the Warning and Response Network Act (the WARN Act) legislation passed by U.S. Congress in 2006. The WARN Act seeks to leverage carrier mobile phone networks and technology to augment the current radio and television based emergency broadcast system in the United States. CMAS deployment in the U.S. is forecasted for 2009-2010 and will include four levels of alerts of which one is severe or threatening weather.

I would like to talk with you or someone at you office about how best to use the Velleros platform to protect people and property in our state. I can be reached at my Velleros email account, jwhitehurst@velleros.com or my mobile at 469-583-5227.


Best Regards,

Jay Whitehurst

Dear Honorable Governor,

Thank you so very much for responding to me.  I spoke to Mr. Arron Syrett; Director of North Carolina Film Office this afternoon.  I must say he is a brilliant young man.  Very professional you would be proud of him. 

He briefly spoke to me about the 15% incentive of $7,650,000.00 million dollars to the organization if we keep the jobs here in North Carolina.  This is our intention with the creation of this film.

I will get back with you with a complete agenda of the projected movie with it's theme, "The Making of David King of Israel."

We are expecting an estimate of 1.6 million people to participate with this project,  to come to North Carolina with new jobs for the area. 

Thanks you for your assistance.
