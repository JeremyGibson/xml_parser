Dear Governor Easley,

Today I attended the North Carolina Army National Guard 1-113th Field Artillery Alpha Battery's Deployment Ceremony. Representative Patrick McHenry send a personal representative, the Governor-elect send a letter, Senator Burr sent a letter also, but my dear Governor, you are the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF for the National Guard. Your lack of attendance or representation was reprehensible. This unit is the first National Guard unit to be sent in its entirety to a combat situation in Iraq TWICE, and their Commander-in-Chief was not there. President Bush, the U.S. Military's Commander-in-Chief, travels to Iraq periodically to thank the troops. Is Lincolnton, NC too far away?? We are not a combat zone here in Lincoln County. The disappointment in representation from our elected officials rippled through the audience in attendance. Our mayor, a former Alpha Battery Commander, did attend though. Perhaps you can send him a Thank You card.

Sincerely,

Sebrena Pearson
Army National Guard Mom
