Hi Natasha,



William Dudley Whitley was a coach and mentor to Gov. Easley when the governor was a young man growing up in Rocky Mount.  Here is a quote directly from the governor concerning his friendship with Mr. Whitley.  Thank you.



“Coach Whitley taught us more than athletics.  He never scolded or preached to you; he just led by deed and action.  We worked together at Denson’s clothing store every Christmas until I finished law school in 1976, and it was in those later years that I got to spend a lot of quality time just talking to him about life’s challenges.  He was good to talk to because he was a thinker, and he also encouraged me to go back to law school.  He and Sheila were a great example to all of us.  They had such a great marriage; they were buddies.  They showed us what a marriage should be, how to love and raise your children and give back to the community.”

Hello,

I was informed that Gov. Easley attended the funeral of William Dudley Whitley. Could you please get a statement for me from the governor about his relationship with Mr. Whitley, and what it was that compelled him to attend the funeral service held Monday.

Thank you,
