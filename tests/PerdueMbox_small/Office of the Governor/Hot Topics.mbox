To Whom it May Concern: 

We are opposed to the changes being made in the school students.  The large class sizes will not benefit our children.  Laying teachers off will hurt the school system deeply.  Why is the lottery money no longer designated for education?  Are we getting funds from some other sources to replace the lottery funds?  Govenor Easley passed a bill stating that the school system in North Carolina will get a percentage of the lottery money.  One of the incentives for getting a lottery was to use the money toward the school system.  Now we do not have those funds.  The employees at cumberland county will, possibly, lose their bonus money.  This is a very very serious problem that will hurt our students and our staff in the school system. 

In addition, the new position created for Dr. Harrison, the former superintendent, is not at all a great idea.  However, Govenor Bev Perdue chose Dr. Harrison.  The public had their chance to vote and June Atkinson was selected as state Superintendent for schools in North Carolina.  The position Bev Perdue created is not legitimate or honest.  There is no way Dr. Harrison should be placed to work over June Atkinson.  Furthermore, we do not need someone to do the job that the superintendent of schools is capable of doing.  It appears as if Govenor Bev Perdue created this position because she is very good friends with Dr. Harrison.  Now we have to create a new salary to pay Dr. Harrison, and this is money that should be used toward our education system and paying for teachers and teacher assistants.

The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  These budget cuts affect students greatly.  How are students expected to learn in class sizes that are already over crowded?  How are teachers expected to survive without the bonus checks and the ABC money?  Teachers and teacher assistants are under payed as is.  Most teachers and teacher assistants work two or three jobs just to support themselves and their family. 

We should be striving to enhance our school system.  Students need to be trained and educated to become leaders and a success in their career fields.  With all these changes, students will not receive the attention and help needed to be successful in the school setting.  Teachers' attention will be focused on those students with behavior concerns.  There will not be enough teacher assistants to assist teachers with the children.  Furthermore, teachers will not receive the pay and bonuses needed to help them pay bills, food, gas,  mortgages, rent, car notes, and car insurance.  Think how this will greatly impact teachers who are single parents.  Most are already struggling. 

Many will have to make a career change.  There are few incentives that currently exist that help motivate people to become educators.  With all these changes, many will definitely not want to be in the education field.  This will leave us with a shortage of teachers and assistants.  Please respond promptly to our concerns.  We will appreciate it.

Sincerely,

Ms. Hodges, Miss Malloy, and Miss Brown

Dear Governor Perdue,

Since the start of the North Carolina EDUCATION Lottery we have always purchased a few tickets a week mainly to help the schools (and of course hoping we would get lucky).  As you have decided to take education money to balance the state budget we have decided to no longer purchase North Carolina EDUCATION Lottery tickets, we will now purchase our lottery tickets in Virginia.

We feel exactly the same way about the Highway Trust Fund money being used for the general budget.  It is time someone in Raleigh learns how to reduce spending and to quit taking money from funds set aside for new highways and education.  There is no way a business could operate the way State government does.  Please rethink your position and leave the Highway Trust Fund and the Education Lottery money along.

Thank you for your kind consideration to this matter.

Sincerely,

Jack W. Hutson and Sandra W. Hutson

Dear Governor Perdue:
Thank you for your support of increased funding for the education of all students from K-12. A sound education and access to health care are basic needs of society and without them our state cannot progress. I am a supporter of Rep. Pricey Harrison's bill, HB 362, which would prohibit the solicitation by the UNC system and by the community colleges of information concerning a student's immigration status. I am aware of the excess of heat over light being shed by political opponents on this issue.
I am a retired cardiologist who volunteers at a church-related clinic here in Raleigh. Recently I spoke with a Mexican woman whose children are in the situation which this bill addresses. They were brought at age 4 or less to this country by their parents. They have completed or will soon complete secondary school here and desire higher education, which they are denied by current policies. We must not try to do immigration reform on the backs of innocent young people. To prevent them from fulfilling their potential is an offense against them personally and denies the greater community the benefit of their educated talents, plus their bilingual, bicultural background, which in themselves is an asset in the modern world. Immigration reform is a multi-faceted, complex issue and must be dealt with by the U.S. President and Congress. Mean-spirited, short-sighted negative sanctions against young people are not the way to do it.
Thanks for your thoughtful and perhaps prayerful consideration of all aspects of this issue. All best wishes for your success with the many demands of being our Governor in this very difficult time.

I am a property owner at Kure Beach, NC and am writing to urge all of you to support Senate Bill 6 and House

Bill 26. This legislation is for a Stay of the Beach Plan  insurance rate increases as high as 17% and for wind and hail

Deductables raised to 2% of insured value.



The North Carolina Coast creates benefits for all North Carolinians and should not be forced to bear the full impact

of this economic blow.

Ms. Perdue,

I am writing to ask for your involvement in the case referenced above. Clearly Judge Mangum is not ruling based on what is in the best interest of these children. Their mother removed them from public school because it was not a good option for them. The facts show the children have thrived in the homeschool environment, and there is no evidence to suggest a change in their schooling is necessary.

Judge Mangum is reported to have said, "that ordering the children into public schools would 'challenge the ideas you've taught them.'" Since when is it legal for a judge to impose his beliefs over those of a loving, nurturing mother whose children are doing well?

Please help put an end to this abuse of power. If this case is allowed to continue as is, the rights of parents throughout North Carolina could be in jeopardy.

Sincerely,

Dianne Nemitz

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am very disappointed that your administration and the Division
of Air Quality have accepted Duke Energy's request to reclassify
the Cliffside coal plant expansion as a "minor" source of
pollution. This pollution permit could allow Duke Energy to
avoid compliance with the Clean Air Act.

This is also not in line with your campaign pledge last year to
make North Carolina a leader in clean energy.

Mr. Gunter,



WCHS can give out all the constructive criticism it feels necessary, but WCHS cant take any in return to make thing better. Strange!!!



I tried to talk with both you and Mr. Ramon at the inception back in November or December of 2007, where Mr. Ramon promised me that he would fix my concerns. That you personally call me and told me that you were privately investigation my concerns over one year ago.



I feel that I need to ask the question:  What type and form of Human Services agency is being run in Wake County North Carolina? As from what I have personally experienced is inconsistent with the by laws of the U.S. Justice Department, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services out of Atlanta George.



Jacqueline family is raising this concerns to fix these issues.  Instead WCHS, the State of North Carolina, and all the person in power, twist, distort, defile, berate, take out of context, and ABUSE THERE POSITION OF POWER, CONTROL, AND ATHORITY to the demise, disadvantage, destruction of the concerned parties.  I feel that WCHS is acting beyond the scope of its charter, and authority with my daughter, in regards to who and how she was on October 1st 2007 thru July 28th 2001. As Jacqueline has never isolated, not visited with, and not kept her bonds with her African American family Ever in her natural born life. Jacqueline has never been imprisoned within the state of North Carolina either, where as she is not free to travel outside the state.



My daughters first language is Flemish, then French, and then English.

My daughters religion in Baptist not non damnation TV.  Our pastor just preached last Sunday about the effects of TV ministry taking away for the personable body of the church in itself, and the body of the sprit in the congregation.

My daughter never had a broken down bicycle in her life, or hand me downs, or had to fight with a sibling or any of her needs. No money in her pocked to buy a stick of bubble gum.



And we never sent my daughter to school with a 102 fever, in the cold, or failed to take her to the doctor, pediatrician, eye-doctors, or any medical care provider. In fact we took her too much, and that my wife was to over protective, as well as my self. In particular with our daughters vocational, family, and medical needs, and after school programs, trips, library visits, college funds, and maintain bonds, visits, and contact her family provided what ever she needed as a village does to raise a child. Like it use to be when I was growing up, that the neighbors would see that the children of the community were cared for as though I was their own flesh and blood.  Which was not maintained by the Judge, Mr. Singer, or the WCHS Social Workers.



Jacqueline feels betrayed, deceived, and hurt. In that WCHS, LCSW Peggy Wallace provide clinical services upon my daughter or over one year telling her that she would be able to go home to her step-mother and father once they completed some services. That in fact they had completed back in early June, July, and August of 2008 in the commonwealth of Virginia, and some in Wake county to the satisfaction of the licensed trained facilitator of those service. Which the State of North Carolina refused to acknowledge, respect, accuracy report on, obtain progress notes, or grand full faith in credit too. Because the father and step-mother, grandmother, grandfather, friends relative, aunts, uncles, and cousin of my daughter are of African American decent, and the mother is of the majority.



My wife, my mom, my dad, and all of us feel betrayed by the State of North Carolina, as persons of color, persons of monitory, persons of European decent.



Why hasnt WCHS address what really and truly happened to the mothers other three babies, toddler, and infants true story of abuse, neglect, and dependency from the Administration of Childrens Services, 8 year history with Child protective Services of the State of New York where she lost all her children too, by forced removal, and involuntary termination of her parental rights..  Where three or four different courts of competent jurisdiction on at lease three different and separate occasion, have established the dangerous propensity of this parent. To the effect that the State of Texas, under the rules and regulation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told WCHS that, this parent has serious issues with her past, and present criminal convictions, and not caring for any of her other three children for over 14 years, or providing any finical support?



Yet this parent is obtaining, all expense paid tripe



A.      It is the general feeling and consensus, Jacquelines African American and European African family, friends, relative, and her church in Hampton Virginia that Wake County Human Services hates, disregards, and totally refused to grand full faith and credit to anything that come out of Virginia. Which was found to by Jacquelines Home State by a court of competent jurisdiction.



B.      Where as from the inception of this matter of my daughter Jacqueline Francoise Davis,  That Danielle Doyle, Janney Magri, Lisa Seller, Peggy Wallace, Attorney Albert J. Signer, Attorney Hal Anthony Morris, Attorney Charlotte Mitchell, Attorney Richard Croutharmel and the Honorable Judge Eric Craig Chasse, have been practicing racial,  gender, religious based discrimination against my daughter, her parents clinicians in Virginia, the courts in Virginia, and the family friends and relative of Jacqueline Francoise Davis who all live and reside in Virginia.



C.      It is the general feeling, concern, and consensus of Jacqueline and her African American, and European African the family, friends, relative, at the underlying issue here is money federal funds & tax payer funds where as WCHS is refusing to spend any of those allotted funds for minority in Virginia to help my daughter or her African American family.  Instead WCHS forum shoppers and discriminates in volition of the civil rights act, with a non-minority majority parent in this matter on the basis of race, and gender.



It is the general feeling, concern, and consensus of Jacqueline and her African American, and European African the family, friends, relatives, that John Tanner, Warren Ludwig, and WCHS are funneling those federal funds to non-minority contractor that are only willing to play ball with WCHS in their professional services in childrens protective services, as employs under the guise of independent contractor.



1.       My daughter feel that she as been abuse, neglected, and dependant by the care and custody of her foster parents Ms. William and Ms. Pembroke.

2.       I my wife, mother, father, family, friends, and relative also feel that these foster parents, have neglected my daughter mental healthy, welfare, and bonds and ties to her family, and minor society against her wishes and her will.

3.       Jacquelines family has been, and is being subjected to racial and gender base discrimination in violation to Jacqueline constitution right of maintain her African American roots within in her family. Where as my wife and my mother, as well as all these other African Americans were a vital part of Jacqueline life. Until WCHS became involved with it tortuous third party interference, with contact, visitation, written communication, freedom of speech, freedom from isolation and imprisonment of my daughter by your agency.



1.       I feel that both you and Mr. Rajano are public servants, and that you and Mr. Ramon have been intentionally making yourselves unavailable to the African American family, friends, and relative of my daughter for almost two years now.

2.       I know that WCHS has used and abused federal funds in this matter to discriminate against my daughter on the basis of Race, Gender, National origin,  disability, in altering the fragile, impressionable mind of a 6 year old, now going on 8 years old. To further the racially, and gender based discriminatory practices of those in power and control at WCHS in this matter.



By identify some areas of concerns of violations of Title VII, WCHS, its agents, and the State of North Carolina has turned against my daughter, in all her rights to her African roots , family, friends, relatives and love one by any means necessary. Because I choose to exercise my constitutional rights to try to make thing better.

Dear Gov. Perdue:

I am emailing you with concerns re: the apparently approved 2009 insurance
rate adjustments to the North Carolina Beach Plan and Homeowners Policies.

I have just retired and moved from Indiana to Kure Beach. There are many
reasons why, and I may not be fully informed, but it seems that the rate
adjustments are particularly "heavy" on those of us who choose to live close
to the ocean. Since Kure Beach is a part of the entire state, it would seem
to me that the state would not impose on part of the state a different
standard or assessment of fees? After all, other areas of this fine state
can experience ravages of nature in ways that the coastal areas do not.

I would ask that you support efforts to stay the Beach Plan increases.

Thank you for taking time to read this email.

Sincerely yours,

It has come to my attention that a series of bills either has been or soon will be introduced sponsored by extreme Animal Rights activists, HSUS, and PETA.  Most of our citizens and farmers dont want interference in our private lives or personal decisions regarding care of and reproductive status of our pets.  I would urge you to use the North Carolina Responsible Animal Owners rather than HSUS or local activists for your animal related problems.  Responsible animal owners do want Animal Welfare but not Animal Rights imposed limits and restrictions on our pets, our tables and our clothing.

Dear Governor Purdue:
Â 
I am writing to you today to voice my concern about (and vehement opposition to) the proposed 5% increase in taxes on alcohol in your recent budget proposal.
Â 
You state in your budget summary that "As families and businesses across our state are tightening their belts to make ends meet, government must do the same."Â  However, rather than tighten your belt to fit the budget realities, you have opted to give state government a raise on the backs of those of us who enjoy an occasional beer (and the brewers who make that beer).Â  Can you imagine the reaction of my employer if I were to demand a raise based on a behavior of my boss I didn't particularly approve of?Â  I would (rightfully) be laughed out of the room (if not fired outright).
Â 
The further claim that increasing so-called "sin" taxes is justified to "help offset healthcare costs associated with the use of tobacco products and alcohol" heaps insult upon injury.Â  As you are no doubt aware, scientific studies reaffirm the benefits of moderate alcohol use (in case you areÂ unaware, a handy review of the health benefits of moderate alcohol use can be found here: <http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/alcoholandhealth.html>http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/alcoholandhealth.html).Â  No such claim can be made on behalf of cigarettes, and to lump them together as equal contributors to increased health care costs is to pretend that any user of alcohol is an abuser of alcohol.Â 
Â 
I know pulling an extra $500 million dollars in tax revenue into the state's bucket has to be tempting to any politician (especially when incomes are down so the state's income tax revenue has dropped), but please take a moment to consider what it means for a moderate user of alcohol, for example, someone who drinks one beer nightly with his or her dinner and enjoys the health benefits that result from such moderate use of alcohol.
Â 
One of my personal favorite beers is brewed right here in North Carolina by Highland Breweries.Â  It currently sells for $8.99 a six pack at my local Harris Teeter.Â  Now, admittedly,Â $8.99 is on the high end for a six pack, butÂ goodness grows in North Carolina, so I think it's worth it.Â  Thanks to your tax increase, that six pack will cost me an extra $.45.Â  Over the course of a year, that's over $23 (for the sake of easy math, I've presumed I drink one a night, butÂ skip Sundays in a nod to the old "blue laws").
Â 
Sure, as you said in your press conference, "those of us who choose to use those two products can afford to suck it up."Â  I can also choose to buy a cheaper beer that's not from NC.Â  Heck, I live in south Charlotte a mere hop, skip and a jump from the state line, so I can choose not to buy any alcohol in NC at all (don't worry, I'll stay under the legal transport limits).Â  But those choices aren't exactly what you had in mind when you mentioned choices, I'm sure.Â Because those choices, when taken by any significant number of people, would kill several good North Carolina companies that brew wonderful beers, and inflate the South Carolina treasuries at the expense of our own.
Â 
Additionally, beer taxes are a regressive tax, placing a higher burden on those who can affordÂ it least and North Carolina already has one of the most burdensomeÂ beer taxes in the entire country (<http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/n_c_has_fourth_highest_beer_tax>http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/n_c_has_fourth_highest_beer_tax).Â 
Â 
I urge you to reconsider compounding this already unfair tax burden in the face of the economic crisis we face (and to certainly not use that crisis as an excuse to ply your tax increase).Â  North Carolina citizens and North Carolina beer drinkers deserve better and are paying attention.

Thank you for your consideration,

Dear Governor,

I have spent the last 34 years working in the public sector and now I find myself unable to work, and had to take a medical retirement from my job as a Police Detective with the Mount Airy Police Department that I spent 22 years devoting myself to the citizens of Mount Airy. I applied for Social Security Disability and have been turned down two times. I am waiting for a hearing before a judge, but during the mean time I am without any insurance. I draw a check for 1500.00 a month, and they want 1100.00 month for insurance. Now I don't know how to pay for the insurance, pay the power bill and buy food, along with putting gas in my vehicle to go to the doctor, oh, did I mention that I have to have my doctor write my prescriptions using the Wal Mart 4.00 List.  I see other people talking about they received disability and I can't get it. I guess my skin color is not the right color.

Now for the reason for my writing, I have read that you plan to increase the education budget, I have a serious problem with that. First, it galls me to see all the illegal's getting use of the money. They are taking away from our American children, they are costing the school system more money because they have to employ more teachers to teach them to speak English. Then they qualify for free lunches. Secondly, can't you see that raising the taxes on cigarettes will only put more people out of work. This is not helping the economy. This "sin tax" should be attached to the "ho's" that are having babies for money. Tax them to have these children out of wedlock, that the taxpayers have to raise. I raised my two children on my own, they should have to raise theirs on their own also. I am getting tired of my tax dollars keeping of these low life's. I get mad when I see these illegal's driving new cars, bragging about getting free money for housing, health care. When I have to pay for my health care. With all my heath problems, I really get upset at them. That they are using my money, when I could use my money to pay for my heath care, but my taxes are going up to pay for illegal's.

How about trimming the fat with these programs first, then trim the fat in your own office. We the taxpayers of this state are sick and tired of hearing about more money being poured into programs for the illegal's.

Help us legal citizens get the help we need, after all we are the ones that have to pay for it!!!!!

Oh, by the way, find out why it takes someone up to two years to get a hearing for disability. I have already been waiting a year, I don't know if I can wait another year without loosing my house and everything else that I worked hard for.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I worked very hard on your behalf.  I did so because I have 10 grandchildren near Charlotte and do not want to see any more "bad air" days from coal burning or hazardous, costly, radioactive nuclear power plants anywhere near these precious children.

Therefore, I ask that you do what other States are doing - Treat what should be public utilities as servants of the public, not allowing them to greenwash us while they continue to pollute and take public monies to make a killing on pre-construction costs for water-wasting nuclear reactors with hazardous waste costing billions that Wall Street wouldn't touch.  

In these tight economic times, we must concentrate on resources that could quickly solve our energy problems by the use of solar, wind, wave, geothermal and efficient building codes as well as feed-in tariffs.  Green jobs far outnumber those in the aging fossil fuel or concentrated nuclear power plants that share the deadly W's of water, waste, weapons and Wall Street.  

NC could be the innovative renewable energy center of the nation.   Duke wants to keep us stuck in the past while getting paid pre-construction costs in the billions over a 5-10 year period and further polluting our air with coal.  Their solar program smacks me as too little, too late.  Half measures avail us nothing. 

Please do not listen to the lobbyists paid by Duke. or Progress  We, the citizens who helped you get elected, are not available to lobby 24/7 as they are.  We are depending on you to protect the public from bailout type scams by big corporations.  We will work hard to see that you are adequately rewarded for doing your difficult job, but we will no longer be conned and scammed or allow politicians to work for the highest corporate bidder.  Time and resources must be used wisely in the public interest.  The truth will set us all free.  Duke, too, whether the big shots who hide behind corporate structure are willing to admit it or not.  Please help by disallowing Cliffside and any new nuclear reactors until or unless the huge problems they pose are resolved first.  Doesn't that make sense to you?

Thank you

Governor Bev Purdue,

My name is Jessica Madden, I'm from Robeson County. I am a student at University of North Carolina at Pembroke and a recent recipient of the 2009-2010 North Carolina Child Welfare Collaborative Scholarship. I also worked for you in 2004 as a Governor's Page in your office. I have heard that you are trying to get rid of this program. I believe this program is beneficial to the social work field and to the children most of all. If this program is cut money will be lost and children will suffer from not having the best educated social worker to be there for them.

Thanks for your time
Jessica Madden

Governor Purdue,

I was very disappointed in your proposed budget as it relates to State Employees.  I have been a state employee for 3 years and love my job.  I did not expect to get an increase this year and thought there would not even be a slim chance for one next year.  However, I did feel that I would at least be offered some bonus time.  I was surprised that nothing was offered to those of us who have not reached longevity service with the state.

Now I do understand that bonus time is a debt on the state financials due to the fact that most employees do not use their bonus time, and should they leave employment with the state down the road, the payout of bonus time is at the rate of pay when they leave the state.  So why not put a "use it or lose it" stipulation on the bonus time?  State that employees must use the bonus time within one or two years.  Since no increases have been set aside in your budget for employees for the next two years, that would not add debt to the state.  As much difficulty as you have keeping state employees or attracting younger workers, this seems like a fair compromise.

I urge you to please fight for the interest of state employees.  We are a dedicated group of workers and feel that we deserve a little more consideration than we currently receive.  I would also appreciate a response as to why offering bonus time with a stipulation that it must be used within a 1 or 2 year period would or would not be possible.  Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
Jane Schairer

It seems that early retirement packages for people who have 26-27 years 
service should be seriously considered when looking at options.  Some of 
the reasons for considering this are as follows:

1- Layoff and furloughs for employees who are within this service range 
is likely to have a long-term impact on such employees since most people 
have their highest salaries in the last 4 years prior to retirement.
2 - The retirement funds are separate so this would move a number of 
people off State Appropriated dollars.  Universities and agencies could 
be required reorganize to meet operational needs and not fill positions 
vacated by early retirements which would result in a savings in State 
Appropriations.
3- Some employees who fall within this service range would not be 
eligible for early retirement due to age if they were faced with layoff 
and this would be a very ungrateful act toward many who have given years 
of dedicated service to the University and State.  This doesn't seem be 
just, especially when many may have had excellent evaluations during 
those years of service. 
4- If folks move from a State Appropriated source of salary to the 
retirement fund as a source of salary it would have less of a negative 
impact on the future economy in North Carolina since they would still 
have a source of income comparable to their current income.
5- This option would have much less of a negative impact on families.
6 - This would only add 3-4 years to the number of years these employees 
would be in the retirement system.

Sincerely,
Wendy Mann

I am a proud 27 year state employee with the DOC. I work here att  Alexander Correctional Institution as a Food Service Manager III. I drive 102 miles a day round trip to work from Yadkin Co., where I began my employment with the department as a correctional officer. I have witnessed the evolution of DOC from 96 small field units with 9 000 inmates staffed with a bunch of farm boys with little or no training to the large Institutions we have now with over 40 000 inmates staffed with the best trained employees in the nation. Today even with the massive unemployment in the state we still are not able to hire the employees we need to staff our Institutions an maintain a safe work place, due to the freeze in hiring, and now our state lawmakers want to Furlough state employees who make over $ 30.000.00 a year, as if they don't have bills to pay like all other the other hard working employees do. Everything is going up and our pay in the department of corrections has not kept up with the cost of living npw for several years. I have reported to work on many days when I should have stayed home sick, I have well over 2 thousand hours sick time on the books and 300 hours vacation time. I have work long and hard to assure I was able to provide for my family and now we face the real possibility of as much as an 8 % cut in pay when we need it the most.    I received a notice from Yadkin Co. that my property was reappraised and increased by 30 thousand dollars or about one third. Please Please do not allow the furlough bill to pass we like every other workers in the state need every dollar we can earn just to keep up with the taxes and cost of living increases we face.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing in response to the news that around 1500 Wake County School employees will not have their contracts renewed in June.  I was surprised and very upset to find out that my daughter's kindergarten teacher was among those who may not have a position next year. We have only one daughter and this has been our first experience as parents with a school system.  We have been extremely pleased and thankful for our daughter's awesome teacher. Nicole is excelling and finding school a very fun place to learn.  In meeting other parents, we have heard nothing but praise and thankfulness for the teachers in our school. I believe that Wake County and North Carolina has some of the most talented and skilled educational professionals in the nation.

That's why I find it hard to believe that one of the places you are going to affect with budget cuts is school employees.  In these hard times, many companies are cutting employee positions with little effect to their product.  Our children are not products.  You may be able to cut funding for supplies, extra activities and programs with little impact to student's education, but you can not cut teachers without having a negative impact on the educational process. The children that are in school now will be the leaders and decision makers of policies when you and I are old.  Do you want to send a message to them that excellence in education is something we strive for, but only in good economic times?

Education is the foundation of a civilized society. I am sure that you, along with all those I've copied on this email, achieved your positions through education, not osmosis.  How did we get such great doctors in our area - through education. I could go on and on through all the careers and jobs, but it comes down to education, education, education.

I know that the economy is not doing well and there is only so much money to go around.  I am very angered, along with many other taxpayers, that our money has been given to large corporations as a bailout and then it has been used in wasteful ways.  As a taxpayer, I want my money back from those companies.  I am requesting that you, Governor Purdue, give this message to President Obama.  Our teachers need bailed out.  They will not waste the money.  I don't think they will spend millions to redecorate their classrooms. I don't think you will give them million dollar bonuses. I don't expect that they will buy any luxury jets to take our kids on field trips. I, a lifelong republican voted for both you and President Obama because I believed you both would work to make this a better North Carolina and United State. I don't expect to be let down. Save our teachers! Our future depends on it.

Respectfully,
Stephanie Marcum

Note:  A copy of this email has also been sent to Wake County Superintendent, Dr. Del Burns via ASKWCPSS.

Subject: use of gas chambers in county animal shelters

Comment: I received an e-mail and looked on the internet and was sickened and appalled to find out that my home state (my grandfather Ben E Douglas was mayor of Charlotte) allowed the barbaric, sadistic use of gas chambers to euthanize unwanted pets. Who could possibly justify this procedure? Would they take their children and grandchildren to see this horrific act that they are responsible for? And are they proud enough of this decision to tell their friends and neighbors what they authorized? Whoever made this decision or voted for this procedure should have to be present when it's done to witness what they are doing to this animal- in their face. What kind of person could do this? the kind of sick sadistic people who kill and rape children. THIS MUST BE STOPPED PERIOD. Create a law to have all pets neutered/spayed unless they are professional breeders who pay very large amounts for liscence to do so. If you're not stopping this you are a killer.

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Michael Hansen 3583 Boulder Ct Wake Forest, NC 27587-5946 (919) 528-1231

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am very troubled by the Division of Air Quality's decision to
classify the Cliffside coal plant as a "minor" source of air
pollution. You campaigned last year to put North Carolina on the
path to clean energy. You should have used the power of your
office to insist that DAQ uphold the strictest standards as
possible with the Cliffside plant.

On the first major energy decision of your administration, you
have failed the very voters of North Carolina who elected you. 


Sincerely,
Marcus Allred

Dear Govenor Perdue: 

Please halt the construction of the Cliffside coal plant.  We here in North Carolina suffer greatly from the climate pollution coming from coal-fired power plants.  Our health is damaged and our economy also is damaged by the air pollution that kills our forests and discourages tourism.  Clean solar based energy is the answer!

                                                      Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bev Perdue
Stop Clifside now.  The air is polluted enough.  Think of the public and not 
just the shareholders of Duke Energy.  I have a friend that works at Duke 
and even he says that Clifside is not a good idea.
Please put a stop to this plant!
Below are some more thoughts about this issue
Fire Division of Air Quality Chief Administrator Keith Overcash and replace 
him with someone who will fight for clean air rather than for polluting 
industries.
- Direct the DAQ to pull the Cliffside construction permit for violation of 
federal standards on Hazardous Air Pollants and Carbon Dioxide emissions.
- Direct the Utilities Commission to implement inverted, tiered rate 
restructuring to reduce statewide energy consumption.
Thanks for your time
Ann McMartin

Governor Bev Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

I would like to bring to your attention the heinous crime of dog
fighting. While this blood sport is illegal in all 50 states, I
worry that it is not being taken seriously enough.

As with any other illegal underground activity, it is impossible
to determine how many people may be involved in dog fighting.
Estimates based on fight reports in underground dog fighting
publications, and on animals entering shelters bearing evidence
of fighting, suggest that the number of people involved in dog
fighting in the U.S. is in the tens of thousands. And dog
fighting has been reported in urban, suburban and rural settings
in all regions of the country.

While organized dog fighting activity seemed to decline in the
1990s, many law enforcement and animal control officials feel
that it has rebounded in recent years.

And it is not just the welfare of the animals that is in
question. Dog fighting, by its very nature, involves illegal
gambling. Dog fighters often face additional charges related to
drug, alcohol and weapons violations as well as probation
violations. Arguments over dog fights have also resulted in
incidents that have led to charges of assault and even homicide.
Other charges might include conspiracy, corruption of minors,
money laundering, etc.

Dog fighting is a violent and highly secretive enterprise that
is extremely difficult for law enforcement and investigative
professionals to infiltrate. A dog fight investigation requires
many of the same skills and resources as a major undercover
narcotics investigation, and challenges the resources of any
agency that seeks to respond to it.

That's why I want to make sure our state's law enforcement has
the resources and motivation needed to take this crime
seriously. In addition, I urge the formation of a state task
force to address dog fighting. This task force would be
comprised of all the major stakeholders: law enforcement,
prosecutors, animal control, animal welfare groups,
veterinarians, public health officials, housing authorities, the
neighborhood watch and others. The group should identify the
nature of the problems in our state, the laws that could be
applied to these problems, and the resources that are available.
Dog fighting is most effectively addressed by a collaborative
approach to this heinous crime.

Dog fighting is brutal, and we need to be doing all we can to
make sure that we end this practice forever.


Sincerely,
Erin Hiatt

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Kim Carnes 531 Silversmith Ln Charlotte, NC 28270-0872

Dear Governor Perdue,
     Thank you for all you do to help the good folks of North Carolina.  I wish you the very best.
Please protect the economic opportunities that our State is counting on to bring us out of the recession.
One of the bright spots in our agricultural economy is the growing of grapes and the resulting wine sales.
Would you reconsider the 5% sales tax increase on wine.   This tax will drive down our thriving wine industries chances of success.  Thanks, David Fussell

Governor Announces Members of Budget Reform and Accountability Commission

Gov. Perdue this week announced the initial membership of her Budget Reform and Accountability Commission. The members will serve with co-chairs Norris Tolson and Hilda Pinnix-Ragland to help Perdue locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

âThe leaders I have chosen have expertise in the public and private sectors. This group can help me root out inefficient spending and outdated programs and bring greater accountability to state government,â said Perdue. âI look forward to working closely with the BRAC team to make sure our taxpayersâ dollars are being used wisely and efficiently.â

The commissionâs first task will be to conduct a detailed review of the stateâs entire continuation budget to identify inefficiencies and develop options for cuts and consolidations.

The commission members include:

Co-chair Norris Tolson â Retired executive with E.I. Dupont; former Secretary of the North Carolina Departments of Revenue, Transportation and Commerce; and the current president and CEO of the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.

Co-chair Hilda Pinnix-Ragland â Vice-president of corporate public affairs with Progress Energy and chair of the State Board of Community Colleges.

Norma Houston â Lecturer in public law and government at the UNC-CH School of Government; former chief of staff and general counsel to State Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight; and former assistant attorney general in the N.C. Department of Justice.

Dan Gerlach â Former senior budget advisor to Governor Mike Easley and the current president of the North Carolina Golden LEAF Foundation.

Curtis Clark â Former executive director of the North Carolina Statewide Performance Audit (GPAC); former deputy state controller for information resource management; former director of the Performance Audit Division of the North Carolina State Auditorâs Office; and the current Global Director for Regional and Local Government with IBM;

Charlie Sanders â Chair of the National Institute of Health and retired CEO & chair of Glaxo, Inc.

Ron Penny â Former director of the North Carolina Office of State Personnel and current professor and chair of the Department of Public Administration at North Carolina Central University and assistant to the university provost.


$56 Million for National Guard Facility

Gov. Bev Perdue announced Wednesday that work will begin shortly on a $56 million new North Carolina National Guard Joint Force Headquarters facility that will also house offices of the state Division of Emergency Management, the State Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation in Raleigh.  The project, which is expected to create up to 4,200 jobs, will be open to bids next week with work to start as soon as early summer and to be finished within two years.

In addition to the National Guard, the facility will provide the main offices for North Carolinaâs Emergency Management division, communications for the state Department of Transportation and the triangle area communications center of the Highway Patrol.  About $41.5 million in federal funding for the facility was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The remaining money comes from state general and highway trust funds that had previously been set aside for the project.

âThis project is big a win for North Carolina.  It provides a state of the art facility that will better coordinate key state services and is ready to put people to work in much needed jobs,â Gov. Perdue said.

Securing money for this project was a top priority for Gov. Perdue, who personally discussed it with President Barack Obama and with North Carolinaâs congressional delegation.  Fourth Congressional District Rep. David Price was instrumental in boosting the funding for the Army National Guard account in the federal recovery legislation. 

The new 237,000 square-foot facility will be located on an 18-acre site off of District Drive in Raleigh.  The existing facility will continue to be used by current National Guard offices now housed in temporary trailers.  Since September 2001, units of the N.C. National Guard have been continuously mobilized throughout the world.

The transition of the National Guard from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve requires more facilities to meet the increased service demands.  Also, bringing agencies that consistently work together under one roof, will streamline coordination and provide for more effective emergency response.

First Recovery Contracts Awarded

Work will begin in April on the stateâs first nine highway and bridge projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts total $36.3 million and were awarded this week by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidders, as required by state law.

âThese first road projects will create a wide range of jobs throughout North Carolina and can address some of our most pressing, ready-to-go infrastructure needs,â Perdue said.

The projects are located in Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties. Two projects, one located in Alamance County and one in Forsyth/Stokes counties, were let to contract on March 17 and will be awarded once the respective low bidders demonstrate that they have met âgood faith effortâ requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts. The disadvantaged business enterprise goals were met or exceeded on the nine contracts awarded.

The bids received on all 11 economic recovery projects let to contract in March came in more than 19 percent, or nearly $15.8 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts can start as soon as April 27, with the exception of the Currituck County bridge replacement project, which will begin after June 30th. 

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation trickles down into the economy six times.

In addition to helping create jobs, the nine projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. They include four widening projects that will help improve mobility and reduce congestion; three construction projects that will extend key corridors and provide regional access; and two bridge replacement projects, one of which will replace the stateâs fourth oldest bridge still in use.

For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov/>www.ncdot.gov.

Subject: Taxes

Comment: Dear Madam, We are very disappointed to learn of your plan to raise cigarette taxes. Surely you are aware of the effect on our economy, that you are putting 50,000 jobs at risk when we already have an unemployment rate of 9.7%, not to mention the millions of dollars in taxes that RJ Reynolds pays. With all the ranting and raving about the dangers of cigarette smoking, we have a hard time understanding why cigarettes are not made illegal. Could it be because the loss of the massive amount of money for the government from the excessive taxes? We believe that North Carolina citizens who choose to use the legal product should not be taxed more than any other citizen purchasing any other legal product. We think that cigarettes should either be made illegal, or that smokers should stop being relentlessly targeted as citizens who should pay higher taxes. Please reconsider. Answers to our questions would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, John and Sandy Slayton

Dear Governor,
     The growing of good North Carolina grapes and the production of delicious North Carolina wine is one of the bright spots in the recession facing our North Carolina farmers.  Many folks are converting their land from tobacco to grapes.  In my beloved Duplin County alone there are at least five new farmers planting grapes this Spring.
      Last year alone Duplin paid its 55 growers $2.8 million for their grapes;  whereas we paid the State and Federal Government $3.2 million.  Already taxes on grapes and wine are far too high.  These figures did not include the project additional 6.5% sales tax on Duplin's wine sales - projected to have generated another $1.5 million dollars.   Just think how much better our grape growers would have faired if these figures were reversed.
     North Carolina wine is not a "Sin" and should not be included in the "Sin Tax" mind set.
     Thank you for your continued support of North Carolina's growing grape industry.
     Thank you for your consideration.
With warmest personal regards,

David G. Fussell, Sr.

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue; Please reconsider your recent decision to sell drug alcohol on the Lord's Day. Such a decision is to invite the Wrath of God upon us at a time when we should be calling upon Him for Grace and Mercy. Instead of encouraging men and women to endanger themselves and others by this drug use, you would do well to discourage it. Why not limit the sale of this drug to 7 a.m. - 9 a.m. Monday - Wednesday only? God bless you to do the right thing.

When you begin your term with this kind of caving in to big
companies, they and we see this as the direction you will
continue to pursue. We worked hard here in Salisbury to get you
elected. If you do not uphold your campaign promises to work
hard for clean energy in our state, I , for one, will be working
hard to elect your competition in the next election cycle.

On the first major energy decision of your administration, you

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to support House Bill 2/Senate Bill 205, legislation that will make all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free. Please keep the bill strong in its proposed form without amendments. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. My support for a smoke-free environment is not in the minority. North Carolinians are voicing their support for smoke-free policies. According to an Elon University poll in 2006, 86 percent of North Carolinians agree or strongly agree that employees in North Carolina should be able to work in a smoke-free environment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that as little as 30 minutes of exposure can trigger a heart attack in someone with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. No one should have to risk their life to keep a job. Non-smokers routinely exposed to secondhand smoke have a 50% increase in risk of developing lung cancer. By helping to prohibit smoking in public places and worksites, you will play an important role in ensuring an immediate and dramatic impact on the health of everyone living and visiting our Tarheel state. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to vote yes for HB 2 and keep this legislation strong in its proposed form without amendments. Sincerely, Shirley Hux PO Box 7011 Rocky Mount, NC 27804-0011 (252) 937-6895

Subject: Domestic Violence

Comment: Dear Governor, I read the Star-news newspaper yesterday and there was a certain article that drew my attention. The headline alone said it all! âDomestic Violence kills 131 People in N.C. in 2008â. Iâve been going through a Domestic Situation myself, but have come to a dead end road. This letter will be a bit lengthy, but I hope my situation will draw your attention and somehow be able to give me answers and advice on what steps to take from here, because I am out of options. My Husband and I separated in March of 2008. I moved out of the residence with my 3 children and started a life on my own for the first time. I started over, it was a new stepping stone in my life to a brighter futureâ¦or so I thought. My Husband did not agree with the divorce. He was against it and didnât want our marriage to end. Iâm sure the reason to you why I left is irrelevant, but it had to do with all the things that Iâve been through throughout our marriage (2 years). It started with verbal abuse, all the classic signs that start the base of a Domestic Violence case (I know because I am a Police Officer). I would have never thought I would fall into the situation I am in now and I would have never thought that I would become a victim of Domestic Violence. I was in denial. I thought to myself âIâm a strong minded woman, a mother, a wife, a Police Officer, there is no chance on earth I would ever let myself get into this predicamentâ. Here I am, head first with no one to turn to because my options have ran out. âNorth Carolinaâs attorney general said Thursday that domestic violence killed 131 people in the state last year, and heâs urging victims to get court-ordered protection against their abusersâ.- Those words gave me hope to what I though was a never ending battle with no results or positive outcome. Hereâs my story: My situation is very different from normal Domestic Violence cases. I became a Police Officer in March of 2006. It was the greatest achievement I have conquered in my life (besides my children). I was sworn in as a Patrol Officer on March 24,2006 with the Leland Police Department. My husband and I were married for approximately 2 months at that point. Thatâs when it started. After giving birth to our Daughter in October of 2006 the verbal abuse got worse and resulted in Property Damage. My husband came home from school (he wasnât working at the time) and began to yell at me for a reason I still do not understand to this day. I decided for my safety, it would be best if I left for a couple of hours so he can cool down and we could talk like adults and handle whatever it was that he was mad about. He wouldnât let me leave in our family vehicle so I took my patrol car instead. He ran out and hit the back of the Patrol car as I was leaving and caused $400.00 worth of damage to the Patrol car. I was devastated. I reported it to the Sgt on shift that night and I told him I was not staying at my home that night and I would find other sleeping arrangements. How could he do this? I was embarrassed, I was shocked, I was scared, I was so confused. What do I do now? Iâve seen this time and time again, not happen to me, but on calls for service while I was on shift. I knew what was right, I know what I should have done, but I was in denial. I thought âit was just an accident, I probably provoked him to do it by walking out during an argumentâ. Looking back now and seeing the things Iâve seenâ¦â¦.I sounded just like âthemâ. It was all my fault, he wonât do it again, he didnât hit me so itâs not that bad etc. Needless to say, I stayed. The verbal abuse continued, but I always wore a smile on my face and never let it appear to bother me. Little things continued to happen, but I just brushed them off and pretended everything was going to be ok and that his behavior was normal. I was terminated from the Leland Police Department a year after my employment. The Chief knew I was having problems at home and decided for my safety and work performance that I should focus on resolving the issues at home because my âmind was not where it should be while at workâ. He was absolutely right! My mind was far away constantly thinking about everything that was falling apart in my family. I started employment with the Pender County Sheriffs Office in June of 2007. Things were better at home, I was able to focus on work and my children. My husband decided he wanted to become a Police Officer (he was in the military for 4 years and was medically discharged for PTSD and other various mental and physical issues). He made it through the academy after the 2nd try and applied with Pender County. He applied at various other departments but they sent denial of employment letters. Each time I would check the mail and see a letter from a department he applied at, I would open them. I know it was wrong, but he would be outraged and take his anger out on me if he knew departments were denying him. I would have to deal with it! My husband became employed with the Pender County Sheriffs Office around August of 2007. I worked for the Sheriffs office for about 6 months then Burgaw Police Department offered me a job with more money. I accepted the position. My husband was still working with the Sheriffs Office at that time and I was working at Burgaw Police department full time and Part time at the Sheriffs Office. My husband and I separated shortly after. Things started to get ânastyâ between the two of us. He realized I was not coming back and that I was serious about our divorce. A few weeks after, Pender County advised me that I am no longer needed. I was confused. Anytime I was called in because they were short on officers, I was there to take their place. They could always depend on me to come in to work when needed. I did my job, and I did it proudly. Despite the Officer safety issues, despite anything elseâ¦.I was always there. I felt my husband had something to do with it, but I left it alone, took what pride I had left and moved on. The stalking, the inappropriate text messages, the phone calls continued. I was in pure hell and sinking fast. I was drained physically, mentally and emotionally. Several instances occurred between the time I left to the time I filed for a Domestic Violence Protective Order. My life was threatened through a 3rd party by my husband, I was choked, pushed, held down, spit on, verbally abused and the list goes on. I documented everything. Anything that occurred, it was on paper. Dates, times, detailsâ¦.it was all there. My husband came to my house while I was at work, found the documentation and destroyed it. That was the last straw. I filed for a Domestic Violence Protective Order through the Pender County Courts. At the beginning, the clerk tried to talk me out of it and asked me if I realized what it would do to his career. I knew what it would do, but that was not my intention and the last thing on my mind. I wanted to be left alone, I wanted some sort of protection from him so he wasnât able to stalk me and send text messages and call. I wanted to feel safe at night and even during the day. The judge signed the order and it was put in place for 10 days until the hearing. It was continued once before it was heard by a judge to finalize the order. I was at peace! The phone calls stopped, the text messages stopped, the random drive byâs stopped! I was living a normal happy life. The life I deserved. I was served with an Emergency Temporary Custody Order by my husband. Our daughter was 2 year old at the time. 2 years I took care of our daughter, I was there for her at every cry, every laugh. I took care of her, then he just took her away! When our 50B hearing arrived, the custody hearing was also heard the same day, at the same trial, by the same judge. I was asked by the judge why I didnât have dates and times on the 50B and I explained to her why. It didnât matter. The judges in Pender County made it a big issue because my husband was still working for the Sheriffs Office. No one wanted to hear our case. During the trial, there were testimonies on what I went though, what happened etc. The 50B was dropped and we were granted joint custody. The judge advised me that I was immature to take out the 50B order and that the judge who signed the temporary order must have misunderstood what I wrote in the complaint because there were no dates and times on when the incidents took place. At that point I was speechless. I thought to myself âits ok for a man to threaten to kill his wife, to discuss with his friends (to full detail) how he was planning my death and getting away with it, it was ok that he choked me and pushed me in my own houseâ. Is this normal? The testimonies were there, the evidence was presented but nothing was put in place. The judge did put a 50C (No Contact) order in place but he knew he wasnât able to get criminally charged with a 50C so it was completely ignored! Back to square one! Here came the phone calls, text messages, visits to my house, calls to work etc. Due to the custody order, both of us are court ordered to initiate a phone call to the other parent every other night so our Daughter could talk to the other parent. I went to the extreme of purchasing a prepaid cell phone with no capabilities to text or to leave voicemail and provided my husband with that number and changing my primary phone number so he was unable to text or call me. It worked for a while until he got upset and blocked that number through his phone carrier. Iâm stuck again! He was giving me no choice but to give him my primary phone number so he could text and call anytime he pleases. On February 20th , 2009 I was moving out of my home in Burgaw and moved further away to prevent any other issues with my husband. As I was loading boxes into the moving truck, my husband shows up at my apartment with a gun, yelling and demanding to know where I was moving. He never pointed the weapon at me, but he made sure I knew it was there by taking it out if the small of his back and tucking it in the front waistband of his jeans for all to see. Charging at me he continues to yell and scream at me. My brother and sister heard and saw it all. They stood back and watched. I was frozen, I couldnât move. All I could get out of my mouth to say was âyour trespassed from here, leaveââ¦.over and over again I asked him to leave. My sister even took cover behind the moving truck because she didnât know what his intentions were. No one knewâ¦.he snapped! I called the police immediately after and they advised me to talk to the Magistrate on duty. After the Police left my husband sent 2 threatening text messages and said heâs going to end it, it will be the last time I see my daughter etc. After grabbing a couple extra things, we went to the Magistrates office and I filed a criminal complaint. The magistrate issued 4 warrants for his arrest (Assault on a Female, Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Misd. Stalking, and Communicating Threat). We left the magistrates office and shortly after the Magistrate called me back and after reviewing my criminal complaint she thought it would be best if I applied for another Domestic Violence Protective Order. The following Monday, I went to Pender County Court house and applied. I was granted a temporary order for 10 days until our hearing. The hearing was again continued! I went to court on Wednesday March 25th 2009 in reference to my husbands criminal charges. It was taken to trial. I brought the two people that were with me that day, we brought the phone that contained the text messages he sent. I testified to what happened that day and the Assistant District Attorney presented the evidence. Mr. Friend didnât deny anything. He admitted having the weapon, he admitted to sending the messages there was no denial in his testimony. His attorney made it clear that Mr. Friend was employed by Pender County Sheriffs Office previously (he was terminated at this point). We had a good case with solid evidence, with dates and times, with no time lapse between the incident, calling the police, and seeing the magistrate. Our evidence met every element for each crime that Mr. Friend admitted to. The charges were dismissed. The judge told me that I was using the Justice System to get back at Mr. Friend by taking out warrants. She also stated that if either one of us had any criminal charges pending that they better be dismissed! I was shocked, confused, upset at what had just occurred. The 50B hearing is on April 20th. Iâm sure Pender County Courts will dismiss this as well despite of the solid testimonies and evidence that will be presented. Iâm at a loss of words. When the threats start again and the harassment and the physical abuse, what am I supposed to do? Who can I turn to? I canât call the police, I canât go to the magistrate and take proper action to the crime that he has truthfully committed. I canât turn to anyone for help and advice, because Iâm immature and spiteful for applying for warrants and a DVPO with a legitimate reason and incident. I was so upset, I told the judge that I would be another N.C. statistic! No one will believe me (except the people who see it) and until Iâm 6 feet under the ground, I will continue to live this dreadful life with no one there to turn to because I have exhausted my options in doing the right thing by going to MY justice system to expect some type of protection! I took great pride and confidence in choosing the profession that I have chosen. To help and protect citizens, to see justice being served. Iâve advised many Domestic Violence women of their rights and Iâve taken off my judgmental blinders to see these womenâs point of view. I am at their level, Iâm a victim of Domestic Violence, but yet Justice is blind and judgmental because we are both Police Officers. Do I not have the same rights citizens do because my husband WAS a police officer? Is he wearing some sort of immune shield against the Justice System? Is he untouchable? I have proven time after time, beyond a reasonable doubt that he has abused me physically, verbally, mentally, emotionally but yet Iâm still at square one. There are still so many things I didnât touch on in this letter and I know I did a lot of jumping around, but what is my next step? Where do I go from here? How do I protect my children and myself? âWe owe it to those killed by domestic violence to look for ways to stop these crimes from happening,â Cooper said. I donât want to be another statistic! Can you please respond to my letter and guide me in the right direction. I want protection, not just for me, but for other women that have husbands in respected positions that were denied protection. Thank you in advance, Jasmin M.

Subject: Reject the National Firearm Licensing Propoasal

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would like to request that you ask our NC Senators and Legislators to propose to you the same memorial the Idaho has aske of its Governor to sign. I believe this would send a clear message to the the US Seanators and Congressman how we here in North Carolina feel about our rights under the Second Amendment. It has long been understood the the police and sheriff officers across the US have no direct law that states they must protect you from harm. Even if they were required to prtect each citizen, we as American could not afford our taxes to support such a numerous staff. Therefore, it is every law abiding citizens right and duty to protect their self and families form crimminals. I hope that you will take a stance with me on this issue. I appreciate your willingness to take the time to listen to your voters. Thanks!!!

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network. 

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

pollution. You campaigned last year to put North Carolina on the
path to clean energy. You should have used the power of your
office to insist that DAQ uphold the strictest standards as
possible with the Cliffside plant.

On the first major energy decision of your administration, you
have failed the very voters of North Carolina who elected you.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #11560] Time Warner Cable should Play Ball Now

Governor Perdue:

It's time for Time Warner to play ball:

The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) is the local source for televised sports programming including 322 Major League Baseball games, NCAA basketball, football and lacrosse, and tons of local sports programming I can't get anywhere else.

My neighbors with DirecTV, Dish, Mediacom or Charter already get MASN, but my cable company refuses to carry the network. 

That's because my provider, Time Warner, is blacking out MASN and preventing  me - and thousands of other local sports fans - from watching our local sports network.  And because of the Time Warner baseball blackout, I cannot watch the Washington Nationals or Baltimore Orioles games - which have been televised for years.

It's time for Time Warner to play ball and carry MASN.

Sincerely,

Ambrose Jones III
