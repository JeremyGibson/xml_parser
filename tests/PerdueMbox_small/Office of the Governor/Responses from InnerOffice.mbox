Hi Zipper and Dosie,  We’re Hans and Toby.  Allow us two to be the first to congratulate you on being the “First Canines of North Carolina” .  We are both North Carolina natives and couldn’t imagine living anywhere else but this great state.  I’m sure the both of you are so proud of your new Governor who just happens to be your moma.  We both wish you the best and maybe just maybe someday we’ll be able to visit you.  Make us proud as the two of you have some mighty powerful shoes to fill.  Best wishes, Hans and Toby

To Whom it May Concern:



In October a request was sent to our organization from the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) to submit a listing of potential and shovel ready regional infrastructure projects to be submitted to The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to examine the best way to direct regional infrastructure investments. 



It is my understanding that the Governor’s office submitted a similar list through the National Governors Association for the State of North Carolina.  



We would like to receive a copy of that listing. 



Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.

Dear Zippy and Dosie:

My dad showed me your web page, so I decided to send along a note and picture.

Congratulations on becoming our First Dogs! Our family is a big fan
of your mom's, and we are pleased she is leading our state.

Like y'all, I like to sleep and play. My dad says that I'm either in
fifth gear or neutral, nothing in between. I also like playing with
my ball and stuffed toys, and watching TV (Animal Planet and NASCAR).

I hope you're enjoying your new house. I bet there's a lot of
squirrels running around the yard for you to chase. Maybe one day I
can come over for a play date.

Take care.

I am a Reading Specialist in Rowan-Salisbury Schools. I teach children the entire day even though I do not have a classroom. However, I was informed today that I no longer receive Personal Days because the county does not get a substitute teacher for my position. I had to obtain a higher degree as well as an additional certification for my position, but I do not receive the same benefits as my colleagues. I serve 55 children daily instead of a classroom of 24 children. Is the new mandat e being interpreted the way the state intended? If so, how will you be able to tell if all school systems are enforcing this mandate? I have a friend in another county who only serves children for half of the school day, but she still receives Personal Days. How is this fair and equitable? In my own county some Reading Specialist earn Personal Days because their principals decided to contract Substitute Teachers for their positions. Obtaining a Substitute Teacher is a school level decision, so how is that fair and equitable? I would love for you to respond and explain the rationale for decisions of this nature. I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Hello Governor Easley,
Considering that I am a certified teacher currently in a counselor's position, I feel that I should be entitled to the same benefits as other teachers.  I am referring to the new House Bill number 15.  The Title l teachers, the speech therapist and myself are the only ones in our school who will not be able to receive that benefit.  It really upset us that we were not included in this, especially since we don't have to have substitutes when we are absent.  Although I feel that we all are teachers in every way, and should be treated as such, it seems that paying for a personal day would actually make more  since if you did require a substitute.  Could you offer some more explanation for our exclusion?  I  teach the children in guidance classes biweekly in addition to individual sessions, and feel that the many students I see on an individual basis are being taught many important skills to empower themselves in school and life in general.  Thank you!

Very Sincerely,
Diana Aldridge

Dear Gov. Easley,

I am writing on behalf of my granddaughter and the way the NC School of Math and Science has treated her. She was accepted into the school this fall. While there she confided to a dorm mate that she had tried to commit suicide once and had chickened out. The friend told the dorm mother and my daughter was called and asked to come get her. She was told she had to be evaluated and treated before she could come back. We did just as required. She spent a week at the hospital in Chapel Hill and was diagnosed as depressed. She was given medication and set up with regular visits to a psychiatrist and a therapist near Duke and the school. She came back to school, my daughter had to bring her each day and pick her up. On the third day they called and asked her to not come back. Their excuse was that they could not watch her closely enough. Now her therapist and psychiatrist both wrote letters to the school telling them not to ask her to leave, that she would be fine and was under t reatment. They would not listen. Instead they broke the heart of a lovely and very smart young lady. At the same time this was happening, some boys had alcohol in their dorms and they were allowed to stay in school. Yes, they were asked to leave and then were let back in. Now what does that say to other students? If you have to get help for depression you can't attend NCSSM, but if you break the rules drinking, that is okay. I am so upset with the school and how she was treated. She misses her teachers and her new friends terribly. Why would they do this to a child?
I think we have a clear case of medical discrimination. I would love to call our attorney, John Buric, in Charlotte and file a suit, but we are about to go under with our company thanks to this wonderful economy. We are in our sixties and are getting ready to lose all we have worked for. Every day is a struggle and now this is happens to our granddaughter. We would appreciate any help you can give.
Thank you for listening. Ed and Betty Kampschroeder

Hi Dosie and Zipper!
I just wanted to be the first dog from Oakwood to welcome you to your new neighborhood!  My name is Oliver, and I live right around the corner from you guys.  I love going for long walks around the 'hood, and my owners often take me by your new house.  It looks like a great place to live with its big yard and all those great flowers to smell.  And I'll give you a little inside info.  If you want to escape and cause some trouble with me, I don't think you'll have much trouble sneaking under the fence at the northeast driveway.
If you're lucky, maybe the Governor will take you to work with her at the State House.  I'm not into politics or history, but the State House is one of my favorite places in the world.  One word: squirrels!  They are all over the place over there.  I'm going to catch one one of these days!
Anyways, I can't wait til you move in.  Shoot me an email if you ever want to set up a play date!
--Oliver

Dear Governor Easley,

First of all, I can't believe that immigration is not a subject in your drop down menu!?!

I can't believe what I read on the front page of the News and Observer today (7/30/08), "Library arrest roils county". We're deporting someone back to Mexico who hasnt' lived there since she was 3?!? She was a cheerleader, honor student, librarian and young mother? Quick, let's get her off the streets and back to Mexico, where she's practically never lived.



Does anyone pay attention to the business school reports that say NC and this country cannot afford to deport all illegal immigrants either in terms of man hours, court costs and biggest of all, loss of labor? When will the witch-hunt end!?! We are a nation of immigrants - mine came from Sweden and England, where did the rest of us come from?



Why don't we focus on something really harmful, like the 80,000 jobs lost to China from North Carolina, also reported in the same newspaper edition. This is what is really effecting my friends and family! Cisco employees are getting pulled off of projects that are being shipped over seas and Marxavi Angel Martinez is our biggest worry!?!



Sincerely,
Kirsten Gardner

Kelley,
I believe this is just a legislative issue that she has.  She is making suggestions on changing the law and her husband is not currently eligible to apply for a pardon.

Visitor: Ms. erika duguay

Address: 675 british rd, kinston , NC 28501

Email: duguaymystang@aol.com

Subject: clemency

Comment: I have written and send an application to governor M.Easley a few weeks ago requesting clemency for James Burnette #1000129.Who was charged with child molestation a few years ago. Never was there any evidence or DNA found or obtained in this case.The child in question has accused several other guys in a previous matter.Those guys, sad to say were convicted. In Mr. Burnettes case, there was no physical or any other evidence that this crime had ever occured. It was pretty much his word against her's.Mr. Burnette was assigned a court appointed attorney by the name of Sharon Kristoff. I have made several attempts to contact Mrs Kristoff just to be informed that she no longer practices law.The system has failed Mr Burnette. My plea with you is to please look into this matter for me.And not only myself but his children also. Who at the time of his conviction were send to a state foster home. It would mean a great deal to me and his kids to set an innocent man free. Sincerly Erika Duguay

Mr. Easley:

I am a Hispanic American born in Austin, Texas. I served in the United States Air Force and holder of Four Degrees. The Degrees include a MBA, BA, AAS, and USAF Diploma.

In the last couple of years the native North Carolinians complain with our illegal immigration problem. Though I am not happy paying for illegal immigrant’s children to go to school or healthcare, it is the right thing to do. But one thing must be noted, people in North Carolina associate immigration with Mexicans, which is completely wrong. My child is often stereotyped at school and letters are sent home, in Spanish, for me to read. Well I do not speak Spanish nor do I read Spanish. We must also note that “Mexicans” are often uneducated, hardworking, and take jobs that other people do not want.

With that said, the problem is with the H1 Visas in North Carolina. I have five Colleagues that are currently working in North Carolina and have H-1 Visas. They are all from Canada and make over 70,000 per year. One would argue that the reason for the H-1 Visa is due to the lack of skilled works in the United States. However, most of the H-1 Visas are for jobs not requiring a high level of difficulty such as: Computer Sales, Computer Technicians, and Computer support. With the current rate of employment, you cannot tell me that Americans can’t perform the same job.

I am a Civil Engineer and was currently laid-off. With the unemployment rate as high as it is, why doesn't North Carolina or the Federal Government revoke all of these Visas to leave the higher paying jobs for our own country?

Attached is a photo of our rescued greyhound Candy, 12 years old.  A few months ago, after a brief bout with cancer, she passed away.  But she had a well-deserved and wonderful eight-year retirement in North Carolina from the tracks in Florida and Alabama.  She asked for little but was a great addition to our family.

I am writing on behalf of Joy Alford-Brand, candidate for appointment to the District Court bench in the 5th District. Joy is currently an Assistant District Attorney and she ran for a seat on thye District Court Bench during the 2008 election. Though she did not win, she did get 30,000 votes continuing to work and manage a great campaign. Joy is a great attorney with a lot of experience, character and integrity. She cares about the public and is passionate about the Democratic party, as am I. She will raise the standard for Judges in the 5th District and I am asking that you appoint her to the bench.



Thank You.

Hi Zipper. My name is Teasia's Gidget Goes. but I answer to GiGi or "G". My adoptive parents "rescued" me from what should be called a puppy farm in Havelock, NC in 2005 when I was 18 months old and have lived in Raleigh most of the time since then. I sure glad I got away from the "farm." I know of only three other Tibetans in Raleigh, except for you and your Mom. I am spoiled rotten. All I have to do is bark a little and my Dad jumps up to take me out for a walk. Most of the time we just "stroll" around. I was trained to be a show dog, but I am too large for my breed. I like better being a house dog.
According to what I am told, Tibetans first came to the US in 1956. A British surgeon stationed in India was given a Tibetan after she had performed major surgery on the wife of a Tibetan tribesman. Early on, we were so highly prized that we were hidden from strangers and owners denied all knowledge of our existance.
I have included my picture sitting on my Dad's lap that was on our 2008 Christmas card. I hope you like your new home in Raleigh. I like mine.

Subject: HELP FROM THE GOVERNOR

Comment: Hello my name is Jesse Tatum and im an resident of Fayetteville. In 2001 I was convicted of a felony and this changed my entire life for the worst. At the time I was 19 and was a very stupid, childish individual that kept bad company. Im not trying to pass the blame but I wish I could have changed those things of the pass. Now at 28 im a changed man , hard working ,smarter , voter for the democratic party , and i also have a family now. Governor Perdue it's been hard on me tring to get work and accomplishing my dreams seems out of reach. I would really like to enlist in the military and follow the footsteps of my father ,grandfathers and many great americans that risk thier life's everyday. I know that the democratic's parties campaign has been on change and chance please help me get a badly needed second chance in life. Thank you so much and God bless.
