I would like to submit the name of Mrs. Cary de la Osa for the position as the new Director for the Office of Hispanic/Latino Affairs.



I have known Mrs. De la Osa for more than five years as an active member of the Hispanic community.  She has also managed the day-to-day dealings of the office she currently works for and has established a number of community contacts, both

within local government and private industries entities.  She is a board member of the local Triangle area chapter of the American Red Cross and an Executive Committee member of the NC Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.



Please let me know if you would need further details of her credentials or a more formal letter of recommendation.

In addition, I can be contacted directly via my cell phone, at (919) 621-3434.



I appreciate your attention to my request.



Respectfully submitted,



Tomas Franklin Castillo
