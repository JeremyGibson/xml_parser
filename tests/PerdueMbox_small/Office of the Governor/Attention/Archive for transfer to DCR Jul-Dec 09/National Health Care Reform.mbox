Comment: We do not support obamacare. If it passes, the incentive for baby boomers now working for their medical care will cease to exist. I wouldn't want to be in office when a baby boomer is told they don't warrant the care they know is out there or they have to wait until beyond the time some doctor (or quack) gave them. Not a safe place to be anymore with the rage that's going on over this. I do believe I'll see the death of the democratic party if this passes.

Comment: Governor Perdue, The people of North Carolina voted you to this post to watch over an protect their freedoms and their rights. Obama's Health Care "reform" legislation doesn't do either of those things. Please do not allow this bill in it's current form to pass. Many more people will be financial harmed by this that will ever be helped. Ask the tough questions and get the answers we all want - reform the right way, not shoved down our throats and paid for by tax dollars. The US and the North Carolina economies can't not stand it, can't afford it. If this goes through, the revolution that follows will make President Obama's revolution look like an afternoon a the park. Please don't let this happen. Sincerely, Margaret Sollod, CPA, MBA, CITP

"But right now, I have a private company between me and my health care. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US, THEY CARE ABOUT OUR MONEY." BASIC HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE A FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY.

Subject: Public Option for Health Care: Means of Paying

Comment: (REVISED FIGURES AND ESTIMATES) Dear Mr. President, I would suggest that one obvious way to help offset the estimated cost (approximately one trillion dollars across ten years) needed to pay for the Public Option in Health-Care would be to impose, at the FEDERAL level, a tax of $0.50 per pack of cigarettes. Thus, one arrives at the following statements and conclusions: 1) Add an EXTRA $0.50 Federal Tax to every pack of cigarettes, no matter whether the pack of cigarettes costs $3, $4, $5, $6, etc. 2) According to the September 9, 2009 United States Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html), there are 307,401,855 people currently living in the United States. 3) According to the Centers for Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm), 19.8% of American adults currently smoke. (Twenty percent of high school students smoke, as revealed by samples of students.) Therefore, 19.8% X 307,401,855 Americans = 60,865,566 Americans who smoke. (This figure ignores the High School smokers.) 4) If each person smokes just 1 pack of cigarettes per day, one obtains the following figures: $0.50 Federal Tax/1 Pack of Cigarettes X 1 Pack of Cigarettes Smoked/Day X 365 Days/1 Year X 10 Years (estimated time needed to fully implement the Public Option) X 60,865,566 American smokers = $111,079,650,000 in Federal Cigarette Taxes. This would thus be around one-tenth of the money needed to implement the Public Option to United States Health Care. This figure is only an estimate, of course. Having never been a smoker (this information could be obtained probably from Pubmed or from the CDC web-sites), I surmise that many people smoke more than one pack per day. However, some people, especially those who are trying to quit, may smoke less than one pack per day. Therefore, the one-pack per day is just an estimate. Additionally, please note that the above figure applies only to Adults who smoke; High School students who smoke are excluded from this figure. (The data for them needed to obtain more precise estimates could be obtained from extant web-sites and/or literature reviews.) It should be noted, according to the CDC, the incidence of smoking in the United States has stayed at approximately 20% of the total population from 2004 to the present year. This seems to indicate that people do not really want to quit smoking. Indeed, I know disabled people (mental and physical) who have told me that, if given the choice between doing without cigarettes versus food, they would do without food. This I consider to be a very serious addiction. Therefore, I suspect that rich people (more than $250,000/year in income) will continue to smoke; poor people may or may not give up smoking if the Federal Tax burden on a pack of cigarettes increases. Inbetween income brackets, one would suspect that people will continue to smoke, thus generating monies for the Public Option to Federal Health-Care. The money required to get the Public Option "up and running" will, of course, probably be higher at first, after which the money required will level off. Mathematically and statistically, therefore, the money needed would follow a nonlinear (quadratic) line, followed by a mathematical "plateau" (asymptote) being reached. I feel that such a cigarette tax as proposed in this letter would be one part of the solution to pay for the Public Option. Sincerely, Walter F. Daniel, Jr. Charlotte, North Carolina wfdanieljr@hotmail.com

What is your position on HC reform?  Since much of the expense will be downloaded to the states, if passed, how do you plan to pay for it.

Comment: I am asking you Ms Perdue, to consider carefully how you will vote in the matter of Health Care Reform. There is so much that is unknown about the particulars of this Bill, that our Nation could end up much worse then before, if this is passed.The backbone of America, the middle class, would be dissolved simply by the weight that it will have to carry. Thank You.

Comment: How will Obama's Healthcare plan affect North Carolina's budget? If this plan passes will we not as citizens of N.C. pick up part of the cost? You, can tell I am not in the group that believes this is a free plan!

The speech last night only further validates the fact this bill HR3200 is too vague and should NEVER be passed.  Where is the monies coming from?...haven't you as governor already taken more tax money in your short term than should have happened?...tell your friend, Kay Hagan this democratic family says "NO" to this government-run anything healthcare, NO to ENDA and NO to any energy taxes...we are taxed to death and the town hall meetings have proven we democrats want "democracy"...not politics.  YOU have  put my grandchildren in debt and this HR3200 will only bury them...ENOUGH...it certainly leaves the doors wide open for illegals to be covered since there is no idendtification verification...it certainly will FORCE all eventually into the public plan and this MUST INCLUDE all elected offificials from the start...if you are going to vote it in as a voter and democrat, then you should be forced into this so-called great plan which has no real detail..only gives politicians the right to fill in the blanks as they go with this 53 member overseeing body....NO< NO< NO

Subject: My thoughts as an American

Comment: I did not write this but it tells you exactly how I feel so please take note of it . Thanks . Letter to the president. Let me first start by saying that, no I did not vote for you in the past election. No itâs not because I am a racist as I have been accused of being one for not voting for you. It is because the change you want is the change I feared. Do I believe that someone that is living off the government deserves some form of help with healthcare? Yes, I do. Do I believe that same person deserves the same health benefits that I receive that I have worked hard to receive (ex. Choice of doctor)? No, I do not. Do I believe someone on food stamps and unemployment should eat better than I do? Absolutely not. Just the other day I was standing in line behind a couple with their two kids with two shopping carts full of groceries. This was not the get by, cheap and quick meal stuff. But packages upon packages, of steaks, seafood, soda, junk food galore, beer and wine. The man pulled the beer and wine back. The cashier rings them up and the woman pays with food stamps for all of the food. The man gets to the cashier and asks for a carton of cigarettes and pulls out a wad of money to pay for the alcohol and cigarettes. I just shook my head in disbelief. How is it that someone on food stamps can eat better than my family. This outraged me. My family lives off of hamburger meat and frozen chicken. But here, this family is that neither parent probably works, but they are eating better than my family. I have worked since I was 16, and now go to school and work full time. My time with my family is very limited. But I want to be able to provide for my family so I am making this sacrifice. Here are some thoughts on the changes we do need and do not need. 1) We do need a change on public assistance. a. Anyone on public assistance should be forced to be put on birth control to eliminate the need of creating more assistance by that individual. It is truly sad to see individuals having babies just to get a bigger welfare check. b. Anyone on public assistance should be forced to be drug tested. For one, if youâre on public assistance you should not have the money to purchase drugs. But it is all too common to see. This also would eliminate not being able to get a job because of failing a drug test, unemployment goes down, and one less person the government has to support. c. Anyone on public assistance should be living meager not the high life. Unless you are disabled and can not work there is no reason for you not to be seeking work. I work 40+ hours a week and I can rarely afford to feed my family steaks. So why should someone that does absolutely no work be able to feed theirs steaks whenever they feel like it. There should be certain items other than alcohol and cigarettes that can not be purchased with food stamps. It seems like they are being rewarded for not contributing to society. d. The majority of people that are on Medicaid have some sort of income, whether it is welfare, or a low paying job. Make them pay small co-pays, I pay good money for my healthcare benefits but still have co-pays and deductibles and prescriptions that are discounted, but not under $10. My taxes go towards enough of public assistance that they can start making a contribution back to society and quit taking from society. e. It truly is sad to drive by a DSS office and see half the cars there are new or better than mine. When I think of someone in poverty that needs assistance I think of someone living in meager conditions and just making it by. But to see, they are living better than me it makes me wonder why I even bother to work, if they can do it why canât I. But, I know my responsibilities and I was raised that you earn your keep not have it given to you. f. We say there are not enough jobs; why donât we create jobs, unemployment goes down, in DSS to investigate and seek out individuals that are abusing the system. The only reason they are doing it, is because no one is stopping them. g. There should be some sort of punishment or loss of benefits for anyone that is neglecting the system. 2) Taxing the upper class individuals a. I know how economics works. I know there are a few certain individuals who provide the majority of things in this country. Let me ask you this, when you start taxing these individuals and corporations these huge amounts, what are you going to do when they get tired of it and pack up shop and leave. Itâs called class warfare and has been around for ages. The uppers live the high life, and everyone else wants to be like them. But I also know who puts the dinner on my table every night and I am grateful for that. b. Your plans for paying for all of these things can only go so far when taxing the upper class. Eventually you are going to hit a hard line and that's when the remaining taxes needing to be paid are going to fall into my lap to be taken care of. c. The upper class is only a small percentage of people, than you have upper middle which is slightly higher than upper class but lower than lower middle, and then you have the lower class. The lower middle class makes up the majority of this country. These are the ones, like myself, that are living check to check worrying about bills constantly while trying to provide for their families. Any extra money taken out of our checks is like putting a two ton weight on us, it's a burden and just another thing we have to worry about. d. I know many people, in this country are worried about the taxes that are going to be implied on many individuals and companies. The reason they are worrying is they do not want to see them close shop and head south or overseas. As the saying goes âDonât bite the hand that feeds youâ. 3) The justice system a. I have never seen a more corrupt system in my life it is truly amazing how a normal individual and someone with money are treated entirely different. If I was to go out and get drunk, and then get behind the wheel of a car and kill a pedestrian walking how long do you think I would be in prison? Probably half of the rest of my life. But if you have money you can get thirty days and then released to home captivity so that you can train. This makes NO SENSE!!! Every individual is equal is what it is supposed to be. I do not care if you are the greatest football player that ever lived, you should be punished the same as any other individual. Far too many times you see people walking for crimes they commit where a person without money would be incarcerated for many, many years. b. The system of checks and balances has really gone to the gutters. You have cops running the streets thinking they are superior to anyone else. Corrupt judges who will jump at the flip of a dime. And now the Supreme Court that has a judge on it that rules with compassion and not necessarily the law. It truly is sad that a Supreme Court justice has had not one but four past decision of hers overturned by the Supreme Court. Am I not correct in my thinking that the judicial branch is supposed to uphold the constitution and pass their rulings like that instead of âmoney and compassion?â 4) Healthcare a. This really is a lost cause. The problem in this country and the problem with healthcare are illegal aliens. They come over here and know the rules about hospitals, that no one can be turned away until they are stable regardless if they have insurance or not. These people took advantage of that fact and drove up healthcare costs. Eliminate this and illegitimate malpractice suits and you will have an affordable healthcare system. b. Medicaid and Medicare are not such bad programs. The problem is that these programs are strictly ran off of taxes and not making the members pay. The only exception I see with that is Medicare because these participants do not work and can not, whereas, most of the participants of Medicaid can work, but they choose not to do so. This goes along with that theme of if it is given to me why should I have to work for it. c. Three words for you âElectronic Records Retention.â This is 2009, not the 18th century. There is no reason that every patientsâ records should not be stored electronically. This would eliminate the space needed to store all of the tangible files, which in turn allows for more space for rooms, labs, equipment. This should have been put in place YEARS ago. This would help with mishaps in patient files leading to mishaps in care which in turn leads to malpractice suits. This technology can be advanced as far as the doctor or nurse scanning a medicine and being flagged over the dosage, allergies, or maybe they had already received their dosage of this medicine. We all know technology is here to help us; it helps us to eliminate problems. There is no reason the government should not have given part of the bailouts to perform these upgrades. This would temporarily create numerous jobs for all the people, unemployment goes down, needed to scan, install, develop, implement, all of these new processes. Than you have to keep it in place and running. d. I know many people are extremely angry over this healthcare overhaul. But it is rightfully so that they are. Youâre basically giving someone that does not contribute to society other than helping raise our taxes something that you work hard for. This truly is the problem with Socialism. I am not suggesting that is what you are trying for, but merely using this as an example. Many of the hard working, working class is fed up with supporting people that do nothing but leech off the government. Why do we have to go out and work countless hours spending time away from our families when all these people have to do is go down to DSS and pick up their stamps, checks, vouchers, and whatever else they are given. In what universe does that seem even remotely fair? It doesnât. This is the downfall of socialism. It does not work because you will always have people not doing their part to contribute and the others eventually get sick and tired of them receiving the same things they do for doing nothing. 5) Illegal Aliens a. Here is another opportunity for creating new jobs. Why donât we create numerous task forces, to search and seek out these individuals that are living here illegally? When they are found they need to be deported and sent back to their country. This process would begin helping healthcare and unemployment. After so long, there will be few if any illegal aliens living here, so the members that were on these task forces will have jobs to go to, unemployment goes down, to replace the illegals that were deported. Even then, they will still need people to patrol the borders to keep people from coming into the U.S. illegally. Are governmentâs main problem is greed; the second problem is we look at other countriesâ problems before we look at our own. I think the focus should be turned to our citizenâs before we worry about other countries, I understand natural disasters and other things require our help but for far to long I have witnessed us worrying about other countries poverty when we have plenty of it right here that needs to be dealt with. America is becoming a selfish place, but the government is making us like this. The government takes and takes for itself, but what does it give back. Laws that take away freedoms, more taxes on things we use that arenât good for us âsin taxesâ (Have to chime in on this, since when does the government care about what I do to myself, last time I checked I pay all my doctor bills, and for all of my medicines, so donât punish me for doing or consuming something that I like. It is my body, and I know and suffer the consequences for doing things to it), make us pay for healthcare for everybody, and the list goes on and on. Finally, I may be harsh but our country is not in the best shape it has ever been in. In fact I fear we are on the verge of a collapse. Racial tensions are high, citizen tensions towards politicians are extremely high, and all we need is the wrong thing to happen and you may see another civil war, or revolution to overthrow the government. As you can see over the last few months many Americans are tired of it, we want to see things change but for the better not for the worse. You want to create money for these programs reduce spending in other areas that are not needed, I see constant stories about senseless things that are being researched or studied. Eliminate all of these worthless grants that study something that has no value whatsoever to it. Who cares if a cow has feelings? Why do we need to know this? 130,000,000,000 years from now our universe may collide with another, last time I checked none of us will be around when that happens. PLEASE, throw some more money away. If you feel like giving out grants I can go do studies on how carpet mats down the more you walk on it. I just need $5,000,000,000 to complete the study and I should have results in 5 years. There is so much wasteful spending that if it were eliminated I believe we would come out of our deficit in 6 months. Quit wasting taxpayersâ money on useless things! What do I want to see my government do? 1) First off, the government needs to stop being greedy and start spending wisely. At my company, we have been told to only spend on things that are absolutely necessary. The politicians should spend money like they spend their own. 2) Quit wasting taxpayersâ money on useless things! 3) Get control of our country again, send the illegals back home, and make them go through the citizenship process to be allowed back in. If they are illegally here in our country and are sent home and then caught again they should be imprisoned. Another opportunity for jobs, unemployment goes down. 4) Get a grip on the public assistance programs. Stop letting people abuse it. Make people than can work, WORK! 5) Make healthcare more affordable for everyone, not by just offering government run insurance, but do things to make the medical field more cost efficient. Every little thing helps in lowering costs, not just making another insurance company for the others to compete with. 6) Quit wasting taxpayersâ money on useless things! 7) I would like to see the judicial system overhauled. Any corrupt officials should be banned and imprisoned. Again, more job opportunities, unemployment goes down. 8) Be wise about taxing. Just because people have boat loads of money doesnât mean they are going to sit there and let you keep taking more and more without doing something. When they decide theyâve had enough and close shop and head elsewhere youâre hurting us. Unemployment goes up. Thank you, XXXXX XXXXX

Subject: healthcare reform / service

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, âWe are confronted by insurmountable opportunities,â a quote from the late cartoonist Walt Kelly, is not normally connected with a conversation on todayâs healthcare crisis. Millions of people are without healthcare insurance (thousands more by the time you finish this letter). Hospital Emergency Departments are overcrowded with patients because they have nowhere else to go. Insurance premium rates are rising at a pace that few of us can keep up with. Medicaid and Medicare are being hit with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of filings and claims. Where are the âinsurmountable opportunitiesâ here? I would like to introduce you to one such opportunity â it is a way to provide 24/7 medical assistance/advice to all who are enrolled. NurseLine, a service offered by WorldWide Medical Solutions, LLC is a health information support service that connects a subscriber to trained professional Registered Nurses via an â800â phone call. Three hundred sixty five days a year our Nurses are ready to help a caller with what to do, when to do it and where to go to respond to their medical issues. Yes, it may mean instructing them to seek help at a hospital or with a doctor anywayâ¦or they might learn how to handle their situation themselves with over the counter products when appropriate. Our goal is to help people think differently about what their first course of action should be when they have a medical situation, and to call this support service before running to the hospital. In doing so, we can save the hospitals, the insurance companies, and North Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars. Is this even possible? Yes â our research shows we have changed the behavior of those who already use NurseLine. We found that 70% of the customers surveyed who had a pre-intent of going to the hospital before speaking to our Nurses were able to avoid an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Thatâs huge. The cost of an Emergency Department visit is one of the two top drivers of healthcare insurance rates today. With 53% of the Emergency Department visits being for non-critical care (which could be handled elsewhere) what would happen if we are able to cause the number of visits to drop by 10%, 20%, 50%...70%? What would happen if we freed up hospital resources for more pressing needs? If our Emergency Departments are already overcrowded now â consider what will happen when the next round of H1N1 flu or other pandemic hits. Our Nurses are ready and prepared to handle questions regarding the H1N1 flu right now. On an equally important level - for our seniors and physically challenged who cannot get out of their homes easily, and for people living in rural areas far away from medical treatment â speaking to a Nurse can provide a huge measure of relief. For those whose âfirst languageâ is not English or Spanish (our two default languages) â we provide medical interpreters for over 150 different languages through our Language Line feature that is included in this service. NurseLine can also be used to address general health and nutritional questions either with the Nurse directly, or through the pre-recorded library of more than 1,100 topics (over 600 in Spanish). The cost of health insurance for a family can range between $300-1,500 a month depending on coverage, deductibles and co-pays; expensive for most families, unaffordable for too many. NurseLine is not health insurance; rather it is health advice/assistance from Registered Nurses. It is an appropriate service for those who are un-insured, those who are under-insured, and even for those who are already insured. In partnering with North Carolina, we are able to provide NurseLine for $45 a family a year. No deductibles. No co-pays. No pre-condition exclusions. $45. And, from that $45, $5 of it will go into a pool for North Carolina to use to sponsor residents who are less fortunate and unable to afford any type of service. For every eight families that sign up, one family will receive their NurseLine service âgratisâ from the state. There are more benefits to this service which youâll find in the product sheet and FAQ sheet which I would like to sen you if possible. NurseLine is backed by a major health care provider with over 30 million members. Those who are interested may enroll on our website, www.wwmedicalsolutions.com using a state code (we would provide you) to secure your state rate at any time during the year. I would be happy to speak with you or a representative of North Carolina to discuss this service and how it would provide that extra level of health support for your residents. NurseLine is one of those opportunities we should not miss. Thank you for your interest and consideration. My contact info with toll free number is listed below. Best regards, Doug Decker

Subject: Idea for Health Care

Comment: To Whom It May Concern: This is not so much a policy comment, but a policy idea. Last year while I was unemployeed I went to get Medicade. I was told at that time, that I was not eligible for Medicade, due to the fact, I was receiving $280.00 per week, or in other words, I had income, so I did not quilify. When I asked the simple question of why after working and paying taxes, since I was 14 years old, I could not get help when I needed it, but the illgal imagrants could come in and get all the help they needed. The social worker, looked at me and stated, âThere is no way for us to track what Social Sucurity number, is matched with what name.â I was shocked by this. When I started working last year, I found out that there is a computer system avialable out there, that is simple and easy to use. You type in the Social Security number of the indvidual that is applying for benefits, and the computer system tellâs you what name is linked to that Social Security number. If every DSS across the country took the few minutes to type in a number to verify that the Social Security number is linked to the name of the person applying for the bennifits, that would SAVE our country so much money, Millions, if not Billions in fraudlant coverage. Now I might be wrong, I might not know the whole story of what is going on in Washington, however, from this stay at home mother, that is one of the easyest ways, and cheepest ways to save money for our contry. Thank You for you time, Kathryn Short

Subject: Health care and loss of job

Comment: Elvira White 5704 Walking Trail Way Hope Mills, NC 28348-9082 September 12, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: This message was just sent to the President. As a resident of NC and losing my NC job, I need your response Madame Governor. Mr. President, as I listen to you speak now, I needed to write you. As a 57 year old soon to be unemployed college professor (losing my job on December 11, 2009), with a pre-exisiting condition (degenerative nerve disease) I am looking at not having health care at all. I went to the Doctor on September 10, 2009 and was prescribed medication by my physician. The insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield REFUSED to pay for one of my medicines, their co-pay. The doctor has to submit a pre-authorization form and then THEY WILL DECIDE if they are going to pay for it and the pharmacy said it could take several days. I looked at my bank account and saw that I had $300 to last until payday and took the risk and said I need the medication. I had to pay almost $80 for 3 medications. The medication that the insurance refused to pay was $33.99, they paid $14.10 on the 2nd one and I PAID $10 and the 3rd one, they paid $1.43 and I paid $35. In total I paid $78.99. Something is wrong with this picture. Please DO NOT back away, Mr. President. We need a public option. In December, what am I supposed to do. yes there is COBRA but what does one pay for it with? I pay through my tax dollars insurance for government officials including members of Congress, now I need the help. To you Madame Governor, the university where I have two more months of employment is now trying to take back the unemployment that I got this summer when I was not working when legislators have insurance and privilege of working for these same universities. Something is wrong with this picture.

Subject: Rep. Joe Wilson

Comment: Rep. Joe Wilson from South Carolina is under fire from the Democrats for his outburst during Obama's speech. They claim he violated congressional ethics - that all attending members should remain silent during a speech. I agree that Joe should have held his words and aired his disagreement with Obama after the speech. However, Joe apologized and that should have been that. Well, the Democrats are so outraged even though they, under cheer leader Pelosi, violated congressional conduct by repeatedly standing and applauding every time Obama made a complete coherent sentence. Maybe they think the rules only apply to Republicans because they have been violating the Congressional code of conduct for years. When the Democrats violated that same code of conduct by heckling president Bush during his SOTU speech in 2005, where was the outrage of the Republicans? The Democrats repeatedly yelled "NO - NO- NO" when the president warned that the Social Security trust fund would go broke in about a decade. Time Magazine wrote an article about it that said: "No! No! No!" they shouted, inaccurately, when Bush asserted that the Social Security trust fund would, in a decade or so, start paying out more money than it takes in. If nothing is done, it surely will." http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,1025086,00.html The Democrats claim that Republicans failed to show respect while the President was speaking. How can they hold the Republicans to a code of conduct that they themselves have chose to ignore? Where was their respect when Bush gave his speech? Where was their apology to Bush for their lack of respect during his speech in 2005? The Democrats did not apologize for calling Bush a liar during his speech although they violated that same code of conduct, but heckling by the Ted Kennedy group is special; and, therefore allowable. After all, Ted got away with manslaughter didn't he! On another note, did Obama apologize to the Police for calling them stupid? NO! There seems to be a double standard now - a set of rules the Republicans have to adhere to, and no rules for the Democrats. The Democrats can do whatever they want! I don't know about you, but I am going to make a donation to Joe Wilson. No matter how rude you think Joe's outburst was, I think he was the only person to utter the truth during the entire speech. I am against this Communist take-over of our healthcare system.

Subject: health care reform

Comment: I am greatly concerned about the health care reform that is being proposed in Washington right now. I agree that health care reform is a necessity and that all Americans should have the ability to afford health care insurance. I truly believe that reform must include a real effort to reduce the growth of health care costs to make coverage affordable and ensure that the health care system is sustainable. I feel very strongly that we can reform health care without creating a new government-run plan. A government-run health care plan would: o Dismantle employer-based health care. Estimates show that 96 million people would be pushed out of their current coverage and into the government plan, thereby violating the shared principle that those who like their plan get to keep it. o Threaten our local hospitals because government programs underpay providers. o Increase the federal budget deficit and destabilize Medicare. The American people want to build on employer-based coverage and improve the current health care system. The American people overwhelmingly agree that health care reform should let people keep their plan if they like it. I urge our elected politicians to re-evaluate the health care reform plan that is on the table right now in Washington and instead, pass bipartisan, comprehensive health care reform this year. Sincerely, Rachel A. Wesley

Subject: Better Healthcare plan that will CREATE JOBS in your state

Comment: I am sending this email to all congressman, congresswomen, and state governors concerning a simple healthcare plan that will cover everyone -- one that we can easily implement and will provide in immediate stimulus to our economy by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. I am asking each of you to take off your party hat for a moment and read this from a non-partisan perspective. You are welcome to contact me if you like or would like to discuss this in more detail, but be open minded and receptive from others even outside your state. I send my initial idea to Senator Lieberman a few weeks back and was very disappointed with the response from his office that they do not reply to issues from citizens outside of Connecticut. We are going to have to be more open minded than this if we wish to make any progress. I encourage you to share this emails with others that are interested in this subject including your peers. I suspect many will not receive this message due to volume and filters so help me spread the word if you think it is an interesting idea.

Dear Brad Miller,



I cannot for the life of me understand how your party can outright mislead and lie to the American public. This is a well documented fact, When Obama spoke on Wed night last week, he knew that any verification of ID had been deleted out of the bill. His fellow Democrats killed the amendment that would have required authentication of citizenship. So how can you say that this mess of a Health Care bill will not allow illegal aliens to get free healthcare? Your not telling the truth Brad. This will totally destroy our healthcare system and bankrupt us.



The News and Observer should do a front page story on this. Please report the facts John Dresher. This is an outrage that the mainstream media is almost purposely glossing over these facts.



OBAMA SUPPORTS HEALTH CARE FOR UNLAWFUL IMMIGRANTS



By Frosty Wooldridge
September 14, 2009
NewsWithViews.com



This past weekend, an estimated 200,000 Americans marched on Washington, DC to express their anger, frustration and outright rejection of President Barack Obamaâs health care plan. It smacks of socialism from page one all the way to 1018.



President Lyndon Baines Johnson lied about the âGulf of Tonkinâ incident. The ensuing Vietnam War killed millions and cost billions of dollars. President George W. Bush lied about Weapons of Mass Destruction. His war continues at a cost of billions and countless lives. This week, President Barack Obama lied about his controversial health care plan. He said it would not be available to illegal aliens. If his bill passes, 20 million illegal aliens along with their children will tap into our health care systemâcausing untold costs and ultimate breakdown.

When you tell the truth, you never have to cover your behind. When you tell a lie, it will bite you in the rear-end at some point.



When Obama spoke the lie, he knew that any verification of ID had been deleted out of the bill. His fellow Democrats killed the amendment that would have required authentication of citizenship.



As Obama uttered the lie, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) could not stand it any longer. He shouted from the seats, âYou lie!â He spoke for Americans that donât appreciate the âlieâ Congress foists upon all citizen taxpayers. The truth: Congress made sure that no ID verification would allow any unlawful immigrant to utilize full, free healthcare without having paid a dime into it.



âThank goodness Joe had the courage to call the President out on it!â said former congressman Tom Tancredo. âIllegal immigrants are definitely getting health insurance under the President's plan. There is no question about it! Joe and other Republicans tried to get the Democrats to agree to an amendment to the health care bill which would have specifically required the government to verify the legal status of anyone receiving benefits under the plan and Democrats voted "NO" and killed it!â

CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf wrote, "Once the Democratic health care proposal is fully implemented, the number of people who are uninsured would decline to about 36 million or 37 million...roughly a third of those receiving coverage would be unauthorized immigrants."

Additionally, within 26 years, on our current immigration path, an added 70 million immigrants will call the United States home. Once here, they may tap into our health care system without restrictions. At the same time, they lack education, language and skills to pay taxes to support the system. It can only break down for all Americans and immigrants alike.

âBut the lies last night weren't limited to Obamaâs statement that illegal aliens won't get coverage,â said Tancredo. âThe President also claimed he will provide health insurance free of charge to those who can't afford it, the care will not be rationed, premiums won't go up, health risk factors won't be considered, no one will be excluded, taxes will not increase, and that none of this will cost the taxpayers a dime! Imagine: a huge federal entitlement for free!â

At some point, President Obama must contend with 20 million unlawful immigrants by enforcing laws against employers that allow illegals to remain within this country. He cannot hide from the facts; he cannot avoid the damage and costs at $346 billion annually; he cannot duck his responsibility to represent the legal citizens of this country; he cannot deny that 15 million Americans suffer unemployment and that 35 million U.S. citizens now subsist on food stamps.



Last Thursday night, Katie Couric announced that a whopping 13.4 percent of American families live in poverty. Last count, 35 million Americans subsist on food stamps. Over 15 million Americans cannot find work. In excess of 13 million American children live below the poverty level.

<http://www.newswithviewsstore.com/mm5/merchant.mvc>

However, 20 million unlawful immigrants remain within America utilizing our health care, our housing, our schools, our hospitals and our prisonsâat an astronomical cost to taxpayers of $346 billion annually. (Source: <http://www.thesocialcontract.com>www.thesocialcontract.com , economist Edwin Rubenstein report, winter 2008.)

Itâs time for Obama to cowboy-up. Send unlawful immigrants home by enforcing our laws. Simple, easy and smart! American health care for Americans! What a concept!

I also would like to know where Bev Perdue stands with our Healthcare reform and how she plans to keep us out of law suits because of the prison overcrowding? We can't not just keep putting more inmates at our understaffed prison facilities and expect our prison staff as well as inmates to be safe. Thank you and have a nice day.

Walters 5916 Marsailles Court Charlotte, NC 28277 Dear Governor Purdue, I voted for Barack Obama. I gave money to his presidential campaign. I receive emails and text messages from President Obama's party and staff. I continue to follow President Obama's health care initiative through reading a variety of sources and watching/listening to leaders from different walks of life. I listened to President Obama's address to the nation Wednesday on network TV. It was not clear to me that he addressed the many questions that have been asked of him and others in reference to the health care plan. The impression that I was left with is that the wealthy, those making +$200,000, will be supporting the majority of the costs and subsidies of the plan. As I am sure ,you as a member of Congress, must find it difficult to live on $200,000 a year. That amount is certainly not what it was even 10 years ago. Still left to the imagination is how the government can possibly handle these additional duties. A budget for the plan was discussed but very little information about where this revenue will come from. My husband and I are in our early 50s and have five children. Two from a previous marriage, both graduated from college; the other 3 are ours together, and two are in college and one is a senior in private high school. We work hard. We have both always worked hard; always with the goal of providing the best for our children in terms of college, education, books, etc. My husband and I have talked about what we plan to do once the children are out of college. We would like to do missionary work. Currently, I cannot see how we can possibly give up our work. Expenses have escalated, mostly due to our nation's deficit spending. I have thought a lot about this proposal and do not think it is good. I do not agree with it and I do not think the plan will be the save all for my fellow Americans. I do not appreciate President Obama saying that those who are talking against the proposal will "be called out" by him and his staff. That is a threat. Thinking back over the years, I remember the cost of medicine and prescriptions skyrocketed once consumers, encouraged by lawyers and others, started suing doctors and hospitals and drug companies. This lead to huge malpractice insurance premiums, spawned a whole industry of attorneys who do nothing but malpractice litigation, raised prescription drug research, tests, and medicines, which then passed all those increases to insurance premiums, medicine, hospitals, tests and surgeries. Ex-Senator John Edwards earned enough money as a malpractice attorney to build a 22,000 square foot home. Is it true that all federal employees, including elected officials, have lifetime insurance coverage? Do we the taxpayers foot that bill? To sum up, I believe that our country is going in the wrong direction on health care. Putting a cap on the amount of money that can be awarded in a malpractice suit would seem very wise. Putting the insurance companies on notice that gigantic pricing on insurance will not be tolerated. Please do not vote in favor of the Health Care Proposal. The plan does not add up and there are still too many unanswered questions. Thank you for your attention to my letter and my request. Sincerely, Elaine R.

Dear President Obama,

    You gave a wonderful speech on health care reform.  I encourage all of us to pray and vote for the best possible plan to protect us all.  It is "christian" to help each other like this.  I would give out of my little money to see to it that any child or adult could have heart surgery or chemo for cancer. I believe in most of what you are saying.  I live on disability and use medicare and need for that to be protected.  I have written you several letters and have enjoyed receiving a letter back from Michelle.  We are all in this together.  I need to investigate if I am going to be protected in my medicare first.  I lost my teaching job due to my ex-husband's white collar criminal actions and I need this protection.  I also liked your statements about Teddy Kennedy and that this was his greatest passion for affordable health care for all as a right and not a privilege. 

    See picture below of me with Ted's mother, Rose Kennedy, in 1976 at the compound.  From left to right, my brother, Dr. Robert Brawley, with towel on who had been swimming, my mother, Betty Brawley,  Rose Kennedy, Me, Jane Brawley Jordan in the yellow, my beloved Beverly Brawley holding my hand, who has passed to glory due to brain cancer this past January, 2009, my nephew Blaine who looks like John, John, although John was 16 at this time and Blaine was four, and my artist father Bobby Brawley.  We are Irish.  Rose was such a sweet person, filled with good faith.  The Kennedys and all of us must take a stand for each other as Ted's dream, Martin Luther King's dream and ours, can become a reality, only IF we act.

    With Best Regards,

    Jane Brawley Jordan

Subject: CC: Letter to Senator Hagan

Comment: Dear Senator Hagan, I am writing to you in reference to the recently implemented North Carolina State Employee Health Plan prescription medication tier and copayment policy changes for preferred versus non-preferred drugs. Specifically, I am concerned about the âbrand name penaltyâ clause that became effective July 1, 2009. Not only is it a glaring example of our failing health care system, it begs to question a myriad of medical, ethical and potentially legal issues. First, and foremost, from my perspective as a healthcare provider, it overrides my ability to care for patients on an individual basis. When a generic (preferred drug) is substituted for a brand name (non-preferred) medication I prescribe, it may not be in the best interest of a patientâs care and/or management of his/her condition. Second, in such instances of âmedical necessity,â there is no âright of appeal,â which precludes my ability to advocate on a patientâs behalf. Ultimately, the patientâs health may be compromised due to a poorly controlled medical condition. Unfortunately, the resulting dynamic is two-fold: further burden on the healthcare system in terms of increased patient care needs (i.e. more frequent office/ER visits and/or additional prescription drug interventions); and, more importantly, decreased functionality and/or quality in terms of his/her life. Third, the âpenaltyâ imposed by this new policy for a brand name (non-preferred) medication is exorbitant. To share a personal perspective, in order to continue to use a medically necessary brand name prescription medicine to manage a chronic condition, the following âfeesâ now apply: --for a 30- day supply through a retail pharmacy, there is a $ 130 âpenalty,â in addition to the standard $ 10 generic/preferred co-pay (total cost $140); --for a 90-day mail-order supply through Medco, there is a $ 284 âpenalty,â in addition to the standard $ 30 generic/preferred co-pay(total cost $ 314). It is also my understanding that there is a âpenalty rate scaleââthe âfeeâ varies based on the drug and/or drug class, with amounts exceeding those imposed in my case. In actuality, my personal experience argues more than just âexpenseââit poignantly substantiates my professional points, as well. I filed a formal letter of appeal with BCBS on August 15 requesting a penalty fee waiver based on medical necessity and financial limitations with regard to the above referenced prescription. On September 2, I received a letter of denial from Sandra Laswell, Resolution Coordinator, Member Rights and Appeals, Quality Improvement Department, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. In that letter, she clearly cited the reason for the denial as follows: âthe request for an appeal of the brand name drugâ¦[X}â¦is not a valid appeal/grievanceââ¦tier changes and copayments for preferred or non-preferred drugs cannot be appealed.â I have every reason to believe that there are other healthcare providers and NC State employees with the same concerns and/or facing similar dilemmas. Therefore, I respectfully ask for your consideration in this matter on both a state and national level as you strive to develop fair, affordable, cost effective and medically responsible healthcare policies. I sincerely appreciate your time and advocacy, Senator Hagan. Respectfully, Beth Moore, MHS PAC

Subject: Health Care Reform

Comment: Dear Governor, I have copied you on a recent letter to my US House of Representative and US Senator concerning my feelings about health care reform. I'm unsure about the weight that you can bear or influence that you may yield in this area, but please take the time to read my letter below and offer any assistance that you can. Thank You Mike Dear Mike, I'm very concerned and distressed about the recent events and debate concerning health care. The Republican Party is ABSOLUTELY WRONG with their opposition. They only believe that if they defeat Obama and other Democrats that it will save them in the future - I believe that they are afraid that they (Republicans) will never be elected again because health care will be overwhelming popular with the American public. Of note, I'm a registered Republican who voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time in the last election. I expect and DEMAND reform. I'm absolutely in favor of President Obama's proposals if they take effect over several years (tweaking and adjustments may be needed - but "sitting on zero" and no changes occurring is UNACCEPTABLE). Thank you for your time Mike

Subject: Health Care Policy and Concerns

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing to you because I am extremely frustrated, in pain, and don't know what to do.... I beg of you to put healthcare reform at the top of your priority list! I am 47 years old, married, and have a nine year old son. My husband and I had Medicaid (because we are both unemployed - laid off), and met the medical bill deductible), until 8/31/09. Thankfully, our son has Medicaid until the end of February. Because my husband and I collect unemployment (mine ends in about 5 weeks...), we are considered above poverty level, so we can not continue our Medicaid coverage. Apparently you have to be pretty much homeless and/or have HUGE medical bills to continue the coverage. I have had nine abdominal surgeries, and three here in North Carolina over the past four years. I may need another one. At the very least, I need to have an Endoscopy done. They may be able to fix my problem through this procedure. I am in horrible pain (doubling over pain), several times a week, and cannot afford this test, let alone go to a doctor! Being in pain almost every day hampers my job placement! So round and round I go... Last month I had four ER trips with two admissions... now that I do not have any insurance, I suffer. All the while, hoping and praying that whatever the cause of my pain is, that it is not cancer, etc. I need to be around for or son and husband!! Please do what you can to help the people that "fall through the cracks" because they make too much money for assistance, but yet not enough to get proper medical care...... Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Sincerely, Lisa Sherman

Subject: HEALTH CARE

Comment: Dear Governor Bev Perdue, I am writing to you because of my concern about HEALTH CARE.I am a BREAST CANCER survivor I was diagnosed in September of 2007. I was glad that I have insurance and in my opinion pick a very good one. I have $4000.00 dollars deductible but I was not complaining because I know it is important to me to have the best HEALTH insurance. I understand that the HEALTH CARE SYSTEM needs a REFORM but not with the expense of my life. When I went through the process of doing all the test MRI CT SCAN XRAY etc. it was nice not to wait for a long time. I spend a lot of money for my medical bills but in return I am still alive and very thankful to all the good doctors out there that took care of me. I understand that it needs reform but I don't think the Government run healthcare is the answer. Because of my HEALTH insurance even though I was dealing with cancer at that time I was not under a lot of stress reason being my insurance took care of the bill. I am concern that one day the cancer will come back then I will end up dead of waiting to get the test that's necessary. Please stand up for us and say NO to this Health Care reform we got to have better resolution than this. I pay higher deductible because I want the best coverage for myself and my family. My family are immigrant from the philippines my parents are working in walmart and have their health insurance they are in there 60's and still working. They work hard and have a mind set that we are priviledge to be here and we should not rely on the government to pay for everything.We are here and thankful for the opportunity we pay taxes every year. I thank you for giving me the chance to write to you. God Bless you & God Bless America! Sincerely yours, Jessica Hess

Comment: The rush to push government-run healthcare legislation through Congress is reason enough to staunchly oppose, but I am faxing you today to let you know that I OBJECT to the government taking control of my private healthcare decisions. Simply stated, the government has no business in the health care business! Although cost is a huge concern (because Iâm certain the working middle class will be required to fund yet another government plan), Americans are most concerned about government expansion and increased control over the lives of American citizens. Any form of socialized healthcare will devastate our nation, and I urge you to stand for the rights of middle-class Americans who have made it clear they DO NOT WANT GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE. Please know that I am watching your actions on this bill. Thank you, Tim Poole

CRFB Reacts to Release of Senate Finance Bill,
Releases Health Reform Comparisons Chart
September 17, 2009

Yesterday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) introduced the America's Healthy Future Act. Like the bills put forward by the Senate HELP Committee and three committees in the House, the Finance Committee bill would use government dollars to significantly expand health insurance coverage. Unlike the comprehensive "House Tri-Committee" bill, however, the Finance bill has been scored as at least deficit-neutral over ten years and in the tenth year; it is also likely that the proposal would generate significant savings in the second ten-year period.

"This is a big step in the right direction," said Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "We are heartened to see that Chairman Baucus heeded President Obama's call to make sure health care reform doesn't add one dime to the deficit."

The bill, which would cost around $800 billion over ten years, is paid for mainly by reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs, imposing fees on health care companies, and taxing high-cost insurance plans. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the bill would reduce the deficit by around $50 billion over the next decade and significantly more thereafter.

"Would we like to see a bill that does more to improve the fiscal health of the country?" said MacGuineas. "Absolutely. This bill absorbs a lot of money that could otherwise be used for deficit reduction. Obviously costs should be brought down and savings increased. For health care reform to be successful, we need to bend that health care cost curve significantly."

"However, given the competing pressures on policymakers and the many calls to ignore the fiscal ramifications of a bill, this plan accomplishes a good deal. Chairman Baucus has moved the ball in the right direction relative to the other major proposals out there - but there is still a great deal more work to be done, not just to make sure the progress in this bill doesn't get watered down, but to go ever further."

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has compiled a chart detailing various costs and savings within the major reform proposals. It is available on our blog - <http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102712739824&s=2159&e=001JkWwaftf9o5X2Zle1JY6BZU7FeNDkjMEa58S6fjLGSkuqaE5pqR-UfH1P8XPfT-nG5gfdNlHz3cuirkbAFXRRt-QREcE-KOX7IKA9hXfjhSM77kWNlhDQebRQkqiH5uu4JPpJin1ccKq-lB7-MCBCMh37wVpn7yBog1Pu5W5nDg=>The Bottom Line - and can be viewed below.

Comment: I am 60 yrs old. The only benefit that I currently enjoy from my retirement is an insurance policy that cost me $149 a month. My mother has severe alzheimers. My father has a degenerative bone disease in his neck that is causing degenerative disk. I quit work in Morehead City where I had lived for almost 5 years since retiring. I worked for East Carolina Housing authority in MHC. I quit work 13 months ago. I have been unable to get a new job in Greenville for these 13 months. I filed for family friendly legislation unemployment but was denied because I didn't get the needed doctors slip from my mothers doctor in a timely manner. Even thought the note stated that she needs to institutuinalized - My mother is still convinced that there's nothing wrong with her. She doesn't know her right from her left at this point. I have gone through what little bit of savings I had over the last year $7,000 -just paying my bills. I am currently getting by cutting grass for people and doing odd jobs. I have another 1.5 yr before I can draw my Social Security, Here's the point that I am getting too. I have been denied help from the State even after an appeal. Now if this Federal Insurance plan goes through and rates go up on Cadillac Insurance plans I am screwed. I am bouncing my butt like a frog at the end of every month now. Frustration is a word that I live with...... John Wilson

Subject: Health Care Reform

Comment: Good Evening Governor, Following is a copy of a letter I sent to the President. I'm sending this to you also because I believe the points are valid and quite easy to accomplish I'd like you to consider adapting them for the state of North Carolina as well. Dear Mr. President, Please DO NOT TOUCH OUR HEALTH CARE!!!!!!! We like what we have!!!!!!!!!!!! If you really want to help improve health care in this nation then take what is there and regulate what you should according to your guidelines, The Constitution of the United States, donât get involved with the competition of the private sector. Let the private sector do what it does (conduct business and compete for it) and you do what you were elected to do that is to uphold and defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and DOMESTIC. In order to get health care under control do what you are obligated to do under the Constitution of the United States, Article I section 8 (3) Congress is âTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with Indian Tribes.â Therefore 1) Enact laws that will put into place tort reforms, get the lawyers out of the ambulances and the doctors offices. 2) Lift limitations that keep competition in health insurance from crossing state lines. In doing this you will be fulfilling your obligation under Article 1 Section 8 (1) The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform through the United States. 3) Get rid of the Fraud and waste without a government program. There are private sector businesses that could use the work. Put some of the stimulus money to good use and invest it there. Respectfully, William M. Treadway
