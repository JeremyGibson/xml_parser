Dear Governor Purdue,

I am writing to you as the director of a child care program and a member of the NC Child Care Coalition. I have just read about the budget cuts to the Division of Child Development. I know that in this very difficult financial time cuts had to be made. I want to thank you for making those cuts to early childhood as small as possible. As an early childhood advocate I support your budget and appreciate your goal to protect those programs that directly affect our youngest citizens.

Sincerely,

Pam Anderson

Thank you Governor Perdue for protecting funding for early childhood programs as much as possible in your proposed budget.  I supported you in the election and I continue to support you as you navigate through the fiscal challenges meeting you in your first term in office.  Keep up the great work!

Governor Perdue,



I want to express my appreciation for your continued support in understanding the importance of Early Childhood Programs.  Recent research shows a direct correlation between quality Early Childhood Programs for students at risk and the drop out rate, the incarceration rate and the ability to financially maintain oneself rather that relying on welfare.  Students at risk can never catch up to their peers without a direct intervention before entering kindergarten because of the deceit in their language and early literacy skills.  These children enter kindergarten with a huge gap in their ability to learn to read. Without closing this  Achievement Gap we will continue to pay heavy tax dollars in incarcerating these young adults, paying for the children that they have through Medicare and WIC and also the countless other tax dollars that are spent because they are not capable of maintaining full-time work.



I have attached or copied the recent research that I have read so that you may be well aware of the importance of Early Childhood Programs.  Please continue to make this one of your top priorities so that at risk children can have the opportunity to enter kindergarten ready to learn, have successful school careers and graduate to become viable citizens of our communalities.

Dear Governor Perdue,
    I am writing to thank you for protecting Early Childhood Programs in 
your budget!  With over 30 years in the field working with young 
children and their families, I can tell you that now is not the time to 
cut back on the programs that support them.  It has been a long, hard 
fight to get what we need and in these tough economic times; I don't 
want our youngest citizens to be the ones that lose out again.  Please 
continue to work on behalf of the young children  (who can't speak up 
for themselves) and their families (who are struggling to keep things 
together).   We so appreciate your understanding and support!
    Thanks again,  Maggie Connolly

Subject: Early childhood budget cuts



Governor Purdue,

Upon coming into the Early Childhood program as an employee, I was taken back and amazed at how a program with so little funding and no PTA, exist and thrives. I am white woman raised in a middle class neighborhood, I work in a high poverty school. We are a Title I school and we squeeze every cent out of an already tight budget.  The impact that this program has on the children is unlike any I have ever seen, but the greater impact is on the families of the children.  Our program includes parent mandated workshops and participation, for their children to remain in the program. I have seen parents grow and flourish in their parenting skills, and gain valuable information on how to better raise their children in areas such as health, nutrition child discipline, and continued curriculum in the home. The reason this happens is the compassionate  intelligent staff that gets involved  in not only the education of the children but there lives as well. People go way beyond there job description and pay  to help families find housing  medical treatment ,shelters, food banks, counseling, jobs, extended care for their children.

Our West learning community has the highest poverty level in the school system we also collected the most coats out of all of Charlotte Mecklenburg schools, during the winter coat drive. Our own preschool being one of the top contributors, with nearly no showing from the very prosperous South learning community. How is that for people giving back and helping others in their need.

 In my judgment for the small salaries that educators make you are getting way more for your state dollars in all the extra social  work that is done at the preschool level. The determination, talent and help that I've seen the staff give, is nothing like I have ever seen in predominately white schools in the area. I have learned much on what getting involved means and going the extra, extra mile to help, it is just part of what we all do daily and we love it because we can see the difference it makes in people.

Here is an invitation to come and visit our facility to see first hand what goes on at the preschool level and how lives are affected daily for the good of the family and community.

Without this early intervention I know that these very deserving children would not have the advantages that their privately pre-schooled counterparts enjoy and thrive from. Let me insure you there are no frills, but only hard working staff members and parents whose level of dedication, once given the opportunity has been astounding. Our parent turnout for the workshops, book clubs, classroom volunteers has been so much more than I ever expected, these parents want what all parents do, to give their children the best advantage available to them. To deprive them of this would be a setback in the parents ability to seek help, guidance and employment during the time their children are in school with us. Please help us as we continue to help raise responsible citizens.



Sincerely,



Regina Homesley

> April 14, 2009

> Both the House and the Senate have passed policy and budget provisions which would dramatically and drastically alter North Carolina âs nationally recognized early childhood education programs.  This paper presents information on both of these proposals, and recommends alternatives to preserve and protect services to children in the early childhood education programs.

> The North Carolina Child Care Coalition urges the General Assembly to protect and preserve its nationally recognized early childhood education system by the following actions.

> 1)      Limit any funding reduction for either Smart Start or More at Four to the percentage amount established by Governor Perdue for all other education programs.

> 2)      Use the federal stimulus funding as required to support the child care needs of working families, without supplanting state funding for another early childhood education program.

> 3)      Use the federal stimulus funding to enact a market rate targeted to 4 and 5 star care and particularly focused on rates for infants and one year olds.

> 4)      Delay any restructuring of either the More at Four Pre-k program or the Smart Start early childhood system until July 2010 following the completion of a study and based upon recommendations from that study. 

>  

> The North Carolina Child Care Coalition has grave concerns about the current legislative proposals for North Carolina âs early childhood education system.

>  

> Â·         The combined total cuts to early childhood education are estimated to be $100 million, a 25% total cut in all early childhood programs:  child care subsidy, More at Four, T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood Scholarship Program and Smart Start.  This is a drastic cut in services that will destroy programs and adversely impact the early childhood system that has taken nearly two decades to build.

> Â·         The combined cut percentage to More at Four and Smart Start exceeds those borne by both the K-12 and higher education systems.

> Â·         Federal stimulus funds designed to support the needs of working parents for children from birth to twelve will be used to serve only four year olds if it replaces state funds for More at Four.

> Â·         The funding cuts will create serious infrastructure damage to the early childhood education system, resulting in lost classrooms, programs and jobs.

> Â·         The Senate Budget eliminates the More at Four Program by changing its fundamental structure from a pre-kindergarten education program dedicated to at-risk four year olds into a specialized child care subsidy program for four year olds.   Such a change would eliminate the current structure of leveraged state and federal funding supporting pre-kindergarten classrooms for at-risk children.

> Â·          Children whose parents do not work would not be eligible for the new subsidy Plus program.   The goal of More at Four is to prepare all at-risk four year olds for school. 

> Â·         Both the House bill and Senate budget propose to reorganize and restructure More at Four without studying or analyzing the impact of these changes on the services for children, the current early childhood education sites that operate these programs, or the local administrative entities involved.

> The Senate budget contains a special provision with multiple components that reduces state funding for early childhood by 25% with a cut totaling more than $100 million and eliminates the More at Four Program.  Specifically, the Senate budget proposal includes the following.

> Â·         Reduces state funding by $77 million for MAF, and replaces part of these cuts with funding from the federal stimulus package.

> Â·         Eliminates the More at Four program, as a high quality academic pre-k program targeted for 4 year old children at-risk for school failure and converts it into an expanded license and subsidy program (Plus) targeted to four year olds with working parents who meet subsidy eligibility criteria.

> Â·         Reduces Smart Start funding for FY 09-10 by $15 million dollars and requires Smart Start supported child care subsidies to be maintained at the FY 2008-09 level of $82 million.   This will force the $15 million funding reduction to be taken in the areas of professional development, health and family support because of other existing Smart Start legislative mandates.

> Â·         Moves a portion of the Office of School Readiness from Department of Public Instruction into the Division of Child Development within the Department of Health and Human Services.

> Â·         Reduces the MAF reimbursement rates per slot statewide while mandating that current MAF standards such as teacher qualifications be maintained.

> Â·          Diverts federal stimulus funds intended to serve children from birth to twelve whose families need child care subsidies to fund only four year olds in the More at Four program.

> HB 539 proposes to merge the Smart Start (SS) early childhood initiative with the More At Four program (MAF), by transferring administrative responsibility for the MAF program to the N.C. Partnership for Children effective July 1, 2009.  It eliminates all staff positions, but there is no budget information to indicate if cuts are being made to More at Four or if the integrity of More at Four can be protected, i.e., how critical elements of the More at Four Program will be preserved.

Dear Governor Perdue,

My name is Lori Burke, and I am a certified More at Four teacher in a local
Head Start Program in Wilkes County. I would like to thank you for
understanding the importance of high quality Early Childhood programs and
wee-educated teachers in those programs.

As you know, most of a child's brain develops in the first few years of
life. It is essential to their development that they be involved in high
quality childcare programs that enhance their development in all areas.

I am an early childhood advocate and received information from the N.C.
Child Care Coalition. I hope you and the general Assembly will continue to
view early childhood as a very important part of a child's life.

Thank you for listening. Lori Burke

Hello Governor Perdue:

Please speak to the House and Senate so that they can share your views on early childhood.  The proposed cuts will hurt early childhood programs and affect our economy.  The Senate budget goes too far in cutting and dismantling early childhood programs.  Please fight for the funding and operational integrity of all levels of education programs, birth through higher education.  Thank you.

My name is Margaret Soik and I am an assistant in the Pre-k room at Murphy Elementary School. I am very concerned about the cuts that have been proposed for early childhood programs. These cuts will be a disaster for many children in our county. This is a county who is struggling economically from loss of jobs. We have seen many manufacturing facilities and jobs eliminated over the last several years in our area. With this in mind, parents in our area who have found employment heavily depend on subsidy for child care needs because the jobs they now hold do not pay as well as the ones they had before the manufacturing jobs were elinimated.

I am the sole source of income for four of my grandchildren who live with me. My daughter who is their mother is bipolar and has not worked since last July. I heavily depend on my childcare wages check which subsidizes my very low income. Please do what you can to keep the early childhood programs in place so that my family as well as many others will continue to receive the help they need.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.\

Sincerely

Margaret Soik

I have been at G.W Bullock for 16 years and have seen our families grow so much through these programs. Families have become more involved and their self esteem has been lifted. If you cut the budget for these programs you are asking to see more and more drop-outs and gangs and drug use. Please know how much I love my job and care about making a difference in the lives of these children that others would just pass by.  I really care about their lives, Please consider what you will be doing to their future as you make your decisions.

Open Letter to My Elected Officials, Governor, and Committee Members
Re:  Early Childhood Proposed Budget
	I have been working with and for young children since 1971.  My
current position is as the Department Head for Early Childhood Education
at Tri-County Community College. I have been a Teacher, Child Care
Center Director,  Child Developmental  Training Specialist, College
Early Childhood Educator.  I speak from the wisdom of my many years in
the Early Childhood Field.
	My over all response to the proposed budget cuts for Early
Childhood  - Smart Start, More at Four, Subsidy. TEACH, is one of
disbelief.  If these budget cuts do take place, you would be operating
under the illusion that:
1) The majority of families are intact â when it is now less than
50%
2) Single mothers do not live in poverty â when 71% of single mothers
live at or below the poverty line
3)  Research on Brain Development is flawed â when we have the most
empirical evidence ever to prove the importance of early education
4) Offering our youngest children fewer quality child care/early
childhood education options would save NC  $$$$$â when in fact, all of
the children affected by these cuts in 2009 would cost the state 8 times
as much in 2017 - 2021 in needed remediation and support.  (Is it part
of your budget proposal to be putting aside extra money to take care of
these children when they later drop out of school or become
adjudicated)
5)  Children will do well in school without a quality early learning
environment â  when statistics will show you that these children are
not successful in school or on the tests, the passing rate of which we
base how much money our School Systems receive.  
     With over 60% of our childcare programs in NC still operating at a
quality that actually does harm to children, taking children out of
Pre-K and putting them back into our day care system is absurd. Would it
not cost more money to enhance the quality at the Day Care level through
the Division of Child Development than it would to support the excellent
quality of the More at Four Pre-K programs already in place???

Please, please, please rethink thisâ¦we would be setting up an entire
generation for failure if these proposed budget cuts are legislated.
Thank you for taking the time to consider the position of Professionals
who are the voice for the youngest children in our State.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to express my concern about an issue that was brought to my attention this week. It is about the More at four program being cut. It came as a shock actually to me, because just last week I was calling the news station and More at four headquarters to see how we could have my daughters Pre K teachers recognized for the hard work this year. So I take this chance as an opportunity to let you know that it would really be awful to loose such a great program for our children, our future generation. My daughter is the oldest of two in our family. My husband is military and I am an Air Force Veteran as of 2007. I got out of the service to stay at home with my children due to the dedication that is required of two military married members, and I decided my girls needed at least one steady parent always around. (Deployments happen all the time as you may already know) My daughter just turned 3 when I got out and I loved staying home with her. I took time during the day and worked with her on her alphabet, numbers, writing....etc. I literally got to the point where she was not staying interested in what I was teaching her because she was learning everything so well. Before she turned 4 I looked outside the home for help since as her parent I was struggling to keep her going, because I was running out of creative ways to teach her new things. I really felt she new everything! I learned about the more at four program and was so excited because she would be with teachers who have learned and know how to advance our children. Of course I was nervous of letting her go to a public school, and at orientation I was the parent who brought a list of questions to the teachers. I was worried about how they discipline, encourage, what they should know by now, and how much they involve us parents. Her teachers Mrs. Reid and Mrs. Presson were very warming to me as a mother and after my daughters first week in school I was at ease. These teachers are WONDERFUL!!! I had heard horror stories of how you have to literally make your presence known, or take the teachers disciplining your child, but I have not once ran into a problem. Her teachers talk to me everyday and I am always welcome in the class. Sometimes I will just show up just to see what they are learning and she is so happy there. They treat her and the others like they are their own children and these two women have so much patience. One thing that the teachers asked me at an initial home visit at the beginning of the year was "What is something Olivia needs to do well?" I said encouragement. We always acknowledge her when she does good and encourage her with everything. They really did listen to me, because Olivia will come home and tell me that Mrs. Reid or Mrs. Presson said she was a great listener today so she got to be the leader and hold the door open. Sometimes I will volunteer in the class and there are one or two kids with special needs and these teachers get hit, screamed at, and they respond with a gentle voice that calms the kids down. I personally don't know how they do it. I am not the only parent who feels this way about our teachers and we want to recognize them for their accomplishments.
     I think the best part of the year was when my four year old came home telling me what a compound word was. My husband and I were very impressed and we called our families in SC, and VA to let them hear her. I didn't learn compound words until after kindergarten, so that goes to show they really do work with our children. They have instilled a love for school in my daughter and have taught me ways to continue with her learning at home. Since she is my oldest I ask for help on ways to improve anything she needs with education and these teachers are more than willing to teach me. My daughter has even taught me a few things from this program. They have something the teacher does and it's called "kiss your brain" and they will kiss their first two fingers and tap their head when they say something correct. It's something we have welcomed in our house and my youngest daughter learns from her as well.  I was given a paper about a reading program from her teachers and I went to sign my daughter up and she is already on a first grade reading level! I couldn't put her in the program but I did ask her teachers to help me with some stuff over the summer so she stays on top of things. Her teachers automatically helped me and gave me great ideas. I have one of the teachers on speed dial and she will take my call at anytime of the day. They have taught our kids how to talk things out with their friends, and my daughter refers to everyone as a friend. Please don't get rid of this program. It is so important that our children learn early in life because technology and knowledge in general is very important to succeed in life. I truly feel my daughter Olivia has received a great step in the education system, and she has a 3 year old sister who I want to be able to have the same chance. If  I didn't put Olivia in the program she would not be on  the level she is now, because I didn't know what steps to take next. Even if you decide to keep more at four, but make it not free this would still hurt people. As I mentioned before we are a military family and we still struggle financially, and I don't want my children to miss out on any opportunity to excel in life because of our shortcomings. We already deal with deployments, and the economy, and every day struggles. Education is so important and should be extended to every child. On a different note, I know that there are parents that do take advantage of having their child in the care of another person. We have experienced it at our school, but these teachers look at every child as their own person. A parents shortcomings should not affect the future of a child. There are other parents who will always step up and help the teachers when needed and these children need this. Please again don't do away with this program. If you could only visit Tommy's Road Elementary school for one day you would see the positive impact Mrs. Reid and Mrs. Presson have on our innocent children. Thanks for your time. If you need to reach me I can be reached at this email or my phone at (919) 221-4321. My daughters school is Tommy's Road Elementary in Goldsboro.

Sincerely,
Melissa Holt

Dear Governor Perdue,

I urge you to step in and fight the Senate's budget proposal,
which would destroy "More at Four," one of the country's most
highly rated pre-kindergarten programs. Especially given this
economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality
pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human
capital -- starting with its youngest citizens.

Children and families urgently need you to speak out against the
Senate proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, which
would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at
Four. North Carolina voters and the nation, having heard your
support of high-quality pre-k in your State of the State
address, are watching.

North Carolina has been a national leader on early education,
and "More at Four" is one of only two state pre-k programs in
the country that meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by
the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER).
Please ensure that pre-k in North Carolina does not regress
under your watch and remains a fiscal priority in our state.

Sincerely,

> Six Economic Recovery Workshops Announced

Gov. Perdue this week announced that the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment (OERI) will hold a series of workshops across the state to provide information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. The first workshop is scheduled for April 28 at 1:30 p.m. in Winston-Salem State Universitys Dillard Auditorium.

> Workshop attendees will have an opportunity to hear from representatives of state and federal agencies administering the recovery funds. These representatives will discuss the current status of funds in their agencies, detail upcoming opportunities and explain the mechanisms for participation in the process.

> North Carolina is set to receive more than $8 billion in federal recovery money, and I intend for our state to not only be prepared to use this money to put our people back to work but also to spend the money with the utmost accountability and transparency, said Gov. Perdue. These workshops will build the bridges between state, local and county governments  and anyone else interested in utilizing recovery funds  to ensure this money is used to benefit all of North Carolina and our people.

> OERI Director Dempsey Benton will lead the workshops. The economic recovery funds are purpose-driven, rather than place-driven, he said. Its important that attendees understand the funded programs so they may actively participate. Its also important for participants to understand the expectations for efficiency, transparency and accountability in the investment of funds.

> Additional workshops will be held in Asheville, Charlotte, Greenville, Raleigh and Wilmington in the next few weeks. Details will be announced soon. For additional information visit <http://www.NCRecovery.gov>www.NCRecovery.gov. 

> State Board of Education and DPI to Intervene in Halifax County Schools

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the State Board of Education Chair and CEO Bill Harrison, State Superintendent June Atkinson, the board and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction will begin an unprecedented intervention in Halifax County Schools, one of the low-performing school districts in the state. 

> "My goal is to improve public schools and student performance," said Gov. Perdue.  "Dr. Harrison, Superintendent Atkinson and I will act aggressively in Halifax County and all of North Carolina to make sure our schools have the support, direction and accountability that give our kids a chance to succeed."

> Under the intervention plan, NCDPI staff will provide intensive support and oversight to coach principals in effective instructional and school leadership, to provide tools to help central office personnel better guide the school district, and ensure that teachers get the necessary support and resources needed to improve student learning.

> Halifax Superintendent Geraldine Middleton has been receptive to us and we look forward to helping her and her team move forward, said Harrison. This intervention is a partnership with Halifax County Schools, and one in which the state board and education department will guide professional development and create a supportive framework with one goal:  improved student learning and achievement.

> Activities already have begun in Halifax but will intensify this summer and in the 2009-10 school year.  Clear expectations and direction will be provided to local leadership, principals and teachers. Three weeks of professional development will be provided to all Halifax principals and central office personnel, and two weeks of professional development will be provided to teachers in the Halifax schools over the summer. This activity will kick off the 2009-10 school year and provide clear expectations and direction for educators in the district and schools.

>> UPDATE - Friday, April 24: 

>> Governor Bev Perdue today cleared her calendar to make an unannounced visit to Dawson Elementary and Southeast Halifax High schools in Halifax County.  She met with the principals, teachers and students, and observed a classroom of her choosing at each school.

>> It was important to me to get a first-hand look at the schools in Halifax County, said Gov. Perdue.  The state will work with local education leaders to maximize efforts to improve student achievement.  Strong leaders, strong teachers and strong community support can make the difference. 

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a Pre-K teacher in the More @4 program in one of the NC public schools.  I have recently read the proposed legislation and budget cuts for the upcoming year.  I must say as a parent of a pre-schooler and a public educator that I disagree with the cuts to the youngest student population.  This program has helped countless students enter Kindergarten ready to learn.  Cutting the funding will cause us to limit this service to the poverty level community that we serve.  It will also mean that students who need to be screened and identified for Exceptional Children's services will slip through the cracks.

I have been in education for almost 10 years now.  I used to teach 1st grade lower level students.  I saw the struggles that some children made daily.  I knew that they could have done better only if someone had intervened sooner.  The first years of a child's life are the most impressionable ones of their lives.  This is when they can easily learn a second language, make friends that look and act differently than just their family, and lay a foundation that will prepare them to receive an education and enter society as a productive citizen.  


Our pre-K program doesn't prepare these children by teaching them their ABC's, 123's, shapes and colors.  Our program takes students from at risk homes and encourages them to learn a better way.  We teach students how to respect teachers, students and administrators.  They learn how to follow a routine and classroom discipline so that Kindergarten is not emotionally and academically overwhelming.  They start out learning that education is fun, exciting, and useful.  Their parents are involved in education workshops, parent conferences, and school events.  They are proud to see their child(ren)growing in knowledge because they know that it will lead to a brighter future for them and America.

You may not see the results just yet because this program has only been in existence for the past decade.  Some of the first students have not had the opportunity to graduate from High School yet.  I do think that our program is helping K-2 teachers get students who are ready to learn and in turn is able to produce better readers and problem solvers.  Who then move on to the 3-5 teachers that can take these independent learners to the next level and teach to the individual student's needs. This also allows the state's EOG test scores to rise.  As these students continue on through to the 12th grade, they begin to focus on a trade/job or a college education.  Both of which have been the strength in America's work force throughout the 20th century.

Now that we are in the 21st century, the economic tide has turned.  If the cuts that you are suggesting go through, then I feel as though the state has not valued my work as an educator and that my efforts have been in vain.  I love my job and I love my student's as though they were my own.  I have spent countless dollars of coins that I have thrown in a jar on little extras that bring my lessons to life.  I am already struggling with my own family.  I am the sole income of the household.  My husband lost his job in December.  I have three children, one of which has Sensory Processing Disorder and ADHD.  Even on a teacher's salary, we qualify for NC health choice.  Times are tough for everyone.

North Carolina has been my home since birth.  I am proud to have attended the Nation's top school of education at Greensboro College.  I am happy to see the progress that we are making in public education at the early stages.  I am simply asking that you seriously consider budget cuts at some other places rather than the pre-k programs.  My colleagues and I can see the need to not open any new classrooms just yet; nonetheless, are these drastic cuts to our end of the system necessary?  Let's hold tight to what we have and continue to strengthen our educational system so that we can have citizens that can work for America in the future. 

I know that you have to make a tough decision.  Thank you for taking time to consider my concerns as both a citizen and an employee of North Carolina.  I pray you will make wise decisions about my family's future.

Sincerely,

Michelle A. Tuttle
