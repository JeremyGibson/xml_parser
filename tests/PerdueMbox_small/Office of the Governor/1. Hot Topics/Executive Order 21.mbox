Honorable Governor Perdue:



Please consider our desperate plea to exempt Community Colleges from Executive Order 21!  A

5% reversion will be a really serious blow to South Piedmont, and probably to most other Community Colleges as well.

Our enrollment is up 20% this semester, and it will probably continue to climb as more unemployed people try to acquire the necessary skills to enable them to find employment. 5% represents $600,000 to SPCC, and on top of earlier cuts is a real killer for us.



We really try very hard to do a good job of retraining as many persons as possible in our service area, but there are only so many rabbits that we can pull out of the hat, and an additional 5% cut may well put us beyond the breaking point.



Thank you for your consideration.

Frank Carpenter, Trustee

Dear Sir or Madam:

As the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Haywood Community College in Clyde, NC, I desire to request that community colleges be exempt from the additional 5% budget cut as imposed by Executive Order #21.  Our full-time enrollment for the Fall semester is experiencing a substantial increase.  Our part-time student count is down at the same time.  We believe more people are electing to return to school to improve their job skills in this economic downturn.  While the legislature allowed us to receive funding for our FTEs, the previous reversions and budget cuts are already affecting our ability to deliver a quality education to these folks.  A further 5% cut will definitely impact our delivery.  Please consider excluding us from this Executive Order.

Please do not consider cutting the budgetd of the Community Colleges.  I am a trustee at Davidson County Community College and know the value it adds to the economy of our depressed county.  Without our dollars we receive from the State we would not be able to educate the downtrodden citizens of our County.  Please consider our dollars we receive from the State as an investment in the recovery of our economy which it truly is.  Thank you Governor for your wonderful service to our State.

Dear Governor Perdue,
    In these economic times, it seems evident that our community colleges are playing a key role in the economic recovery, as well as increasing the tax base as people go back to work in the new fields for which they are training.  It is a fact that as the community colleges increase their full time enrollments (FTEs), they have to wait a full year for the allocations from the state system to catch up.  This 5% reversion under Executive Order 21 is especially difficult for them to deal with at this time.
    As a Brunswick Community College Board of Trustees member, and as the House of Representatives member from Brunswick County, I am asking that the 5% reversion under Executive Order 21 be reversed for all community colleges in the system.  Your favorable consideration of this request is appreciated.

Governor Perdue,

We at South Piedmont Community College are in a very difficult position if Executive Order 21 is enacted and requires us to revert 5% ($600,000) to the state. Our enrollment is up 20%, not including our continuing education enrollment classes which we predict will increase also.

Please be sensitive to the need of all community colleges during this difficult time, and please realize, as I am sure you do, that when jobs are lost the community college enrollment grows.

Thank you for your consideration of exempting community colleges from this reversion so we can continue to provide the quality education for our students. Without the funding it may become necessary for us to not offer some classes, possible cutbacks on faculty and staff, and to not admit some students due to the financial strain.

You have always been a strong supporter of the community college system and this exemption would prove to us at South Piedmont that you continue to be that strong supporter. I certainly understand the overall financial problems we have in North Carolina and I certainly do not envy you for trying to deal with this problem. I also admire you in your zeal to do what is right for the citizens of this state and I think this would be an example of doing what is right.

Regards,

Thomas L. Crooke, Sr.

Thank you for all your support for the community college system.
I am respectfully requesting however, that continued consideration be given to allowing the community colleges be exempt from the 5% additional cut imposed by the Executive Order 21.

Pitt Community College is doing everything possible to continue to serve a steady increase in enrollment with less space and resources. PCC's administration is to be commended for it's creativity and flexibility in serving so many citizens.

Being exempt from the additional cut will make a major difference to every college and its ability to provide desperately needed services in the communities across North Carolina.

Best regards.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I address your from my position as a member of the Surry Community College
Board of Trustees and as an officer in the North Carolina Association of
Community College Trustees (NCACCT). I am an early supporter of your
campaign for Governor. I therefore appreciate very much the leadership you
have exercised in the extremely difficult times that you have faced since
assuming the Office of Governor. I know that you must make incredibly hard
decision as you balance the needs of the State against limited funds. I
respect your decision making ability and trust that North Carolina will
recover rapidly from the financial difficulties we still face. 

I ask you, nevertheless, to reconsider your prior decision on the
applicability of Executive Order 21. As succinctly stated in an earlier
letter to you from NCACCT  Executive Director, Dr. Donny Hunter, and as
approved by our Executive Committee, I hope that you  will exempt the
Community College system from Executive Order 21. I believe that an
additional cut of 5 percent imposed on the Community College system at this
time will be devastating to the community colleges that North Carolina
depends upon to lead us out of this unprecedented recession.

Please accept my  expression of deep appreciation for your outstanding
leadership of our State and my complete trust in your judgment regardless of
how you must approach the question I have addressed above. Thank you for
considering this request. 

Bob

On behalf of the citizens of North Carolina, I urge you to please exempt the community colleges from the additoinal 5% budget reduction called for in Executive Order #21.  As you are fully aware, during these difficult times, the community colleges are working so hard to help train, retrain and educate the unemployed to help them regain employment when the economy improves. 

Your consideration to exempt the community colleges from the 5% reduction is paramount in enabling the community colleges to perform their purpose for being established.  Please, please give this your immediate attention.

Dear Governor Purdue,

The North Carolina Community College system is one of the primary tools the State of North Carolina has to construct a path for economic recovery.  The community colleges are besieged with applications from students who cannot attend a four year university due to a change in their financial circumstances.  The recently unemployed are turning to their community colleges in large numbers to acquire new job skills.  This increased enrollment is placing a strain, in part due to the budget cuts already enacted,on the faculty and facilities.

Your Executive Order number 21 allows special exemptions from the mandatory budget reduction of 5%.  I am asking that you exempt the community colleges, as they provide classroom instruction that assist economic development as well as specialized training in law enforcement, health care and public safety.

Sincerely,
Patricia Weeks
Nash Community College, Trustee

Good Morning.

    I serve as chairman of the board of Gaston College in Dallas, NC.  I am writing to ask for reconsideration of the 5% cut to community colleges imposed by Executive Order 21.  Gaston College is teeming with new students. Because of layoffs in manufacturing and other jobs in our hard hit community, hundreds more local residents are returning to the College for retraining - more than at any time in the history of our school.    Please exempt community colleges from the 5% reversion.  A reversion of such magnitude is providing a hardship on our attempts to provide quality education so many more or our citizens.

Thanks for responding to Governor Perdue.  I doubt that we can recoup the 5% we have already given back, but it is appearing that we may be able to hang on to the addition 1% which we have been requested to hold in reserve.  That would provide an additional $250K for us if we could retain it.

I HAVE TRIED NOT TO BOTHER YOU DURING THESE HECTIC TIMES, BUT THERE IS A CRITICAL MATTER I FEEL COMPELLED TO ADDRESS.COMUNITY COLLEGES CONSTITUTE A MAJOR FORCE IN THE RECOVERY FOM THE RECENT RECESSION. AS PEOPLE HAVE LOST JOBS A LARGE NUMBER ARE ENTERING THE COLLEGES TO RETRAIN SO THEY CAN REGAIN THEIR EARNING POTENTIAL THIS MEANS THE COLLEGES MUST INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES WHILE THEIR FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CUT THROUGH SIGNIFICANT REVERSIONS. IF THE 5% ADDITIONAL CUT FROM EXECUTIVE ORDER 21 APPLIES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE RESULT COULD BE DEVASTATING TO AN ALREADY FRAGILE SITUATION. I KOW YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE. THIS ONE COMES FROM AN ACTIVE ARDENT SUPPORTER. YOUR FRIEND.

Governor Perdue:

It seems like it was not long ago that I had the privilege to tour you
around our college while you were campaigning for your office.  As our
college celebrates our 50th year of operation, we continue to provide
our students with the tools needed to be successful in the career of
their choosing.  However, the proposed additional 5% cut imposed by
Executive Order 21 will only place more strain on our college.  I am
sure that Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College is not the only
school with these concerns.  With an increase close to 10% in
enrollment, asking us to cut an additional 5% will be detrimental to
welfare of A-B Tech.  The financial strain on campus continues to be
more evident each week.  With this strain more concerns come to my
office on a daily basis.  In my position I have the privilege to serve
not only as President of our college's Student Government Association
but also as a member of our Board of Trustees.  Within this role I see
the operations of our college on all levels, and I can see the
overwhelming concern on the faces of not only the facility and staff but
the student body as well.  I ask with great feelings of respect that you
please reconsider the purposed budget cut to the North Carolina
Community College System.  Thank you for your service to our state.

Respectfully Yours,

Governor Purdue,

Please, reconsider the budgets of the community colleges of the state. They already function on a shoestring and are staffed with people who always go the extra mile. With enrollment skyrocketing as people scramble to retool in a tight and changing job market, the community colleges simply will not be able to do the job. staff morale will drop, people we need may give up and retire and not be replaced for lack of money, and the bottom line is the students and the economy will not get the boost it needs. I know this can't be your intention. We need to be giving hope in times like these. Surely with the federal priority on community colleges, the state can follow suit.

Dear Governor Perdue:

Would you please consider the mission of the community college system in serving the citizens of North Carolina.  The 5% reversion in their budgets is a major issue for most community college.  Would you please re-consider.

Thank you for all that you do.

Respectfully,

Carroll Hemphill, McDowell County

I am writing to request that Community Colleges be exempt of the 5 % additional cut imposed by Executive Order 21. 
As the Governor well knows, Community Colleges are a vital part of preparing ones self for the future. We are on ground level meeting students face to face.   We are charged with the next step in education, teaching the fundamentals of real world work.  We must continue teaching the fundamentals. As in football, fundamentals are blocking and tackling. Until we embrace this then the rest gets lost in the shuffle.  The same as in life, unless the fundamentals are taught repeatedly and embraced by the students they are at risk of losing much of their potential. These fundamentals and  education will remain with students the rest of their life.

We provide opportunities to most students who are living on the lower end of the economic scale.   Many would never see the college classroom, nor would they reach their potential.  We are their life support, their highway to higher education, their hope to rise above their present status and their dream for a better life.
As a trustee of Gaston College I see the students and I see the hope.  I am on one of our campuses almost every week and I see the students knowing full well that many would not be in higher education if it were not for our college.  

Community Colleges have a story to tell, all 58 of us and I am requesting that you as the Governor recognize this meaningful request when considering the exemption as described in Executive Order 21.  This could make a significant difference in the life of many students.

We are making a difference and with your help this difference will grow.

Thank you,

On behalf of the trustees, faculty, staff, and students at the college, as well as those we are trying to serve in these dire economic times, I thank you for the consideration you give to exempting community colleges from this reversion.

Dear Governor Perdue:

It is my understanding you are giving consideration to the request that the North Carolina Community College System be exempt from the 5% reversion requested of state agencies.  

As president of Montgomery  Community College, a small, rural college which has experienced growth over the past five years and desperately needs its funding to accommodate the growing number of students, I am respectfully asking that you please reconsider your decision and exempt the community colleges from EO-21 as you have done with other agencies.

With your personal knowledge of the community college system, our funding in arrears, and the success rates of our graduates, I hope you will see the necessity of this exemption.

Thank you for your consideration.  I hope you are doing well.  We would love to have you back for a visit in Montgomery County.  Your friend, Mary  Kirk

Dear Governor Perdue:

It is my understanding you are giving consideration to the request that the North Carolina Community College System be exempt from the 5% reversion requested of state agencies.  

As president of Montgomery  Community College, a small, rural college which has experienced growth over the past five years and desperately needs its funding to accommodate the growing number of students, I am respectfully asking that you please reconsider your decision and exempt the community colleges from EO-21 as you have done with other agencies.

With your personal knowledge of the community college system, our funding in arrears, and the success rates of our graduates, I hope you will see the necessity of this exemption.

Thank you for your consideration.  I hope you are doing well.  We would love to have you back for a visit in Montgomery County.  Your friend, Mary  Kirk

Dear Governor Perdue,

The attached letter and resolution are from the Gaston College Board of Trustees Chair Barbara Voorhees, and the Board of trustees asking that you reverse your decision to include NC Community Colleges in the five percent budget reduction.  This reduction has had a detrimental impact on our ability to serve a student population that has increased 25% over last fall.

Please reconsider your decision.  (Signed copies of these documents will be posted in today's mail.)

Respectfully,

Pat Skinner

Dear Governor Perdue:

     Through your very close relationship with the North Carolina Community College System and each of its Colleges, you are very familiar with community college funding needs.  It was very disappointing to find that community colleges were included in Executive Order Number 21 which ordered that State agencies'  allotments be reduced by five percent.  Since community colleges in North Carolina are not State agencies, they should not be included in the Executive Order.
     As you know, community colleges are already unjustly funded a year in arrears, and,  specifically, Rowan-Cabarrus Community College has experienced a 25 percent increase in enrollment, therefore any reduction in funding is devastating.  Hopefully the inclusion of community colleges in  Executive Order #21 is perhaps an oversite and can be excluded.
     At its regular monthly meeting, the Board of Trustees of RCCC  approved a resolution opposing provisions of Executive Order Number 21.  That resolution is attached for your consideration.
     Thank you for all you do and especialy for your continued support of the community college mission.

                                                                   Sincerely,

                                                                   Ray E. Paradowski

The Honorable Beverly Eaves Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, North Carolina 27699-0301

Dear Governor Perdue: 

On behalf of the Board of Trustees of Rockingham Community College, I
am pleased to notify you of the Boardâs action on September 8, 2009,
expressing full support and endorsement of the request from the North
Carolina Association of Community College Trustees to exempt the
stateâs community colleges from the 5 percent allotment reduction
contained in Executive Order Number 21.    Such action is recorded in
the official minutes of the Board of Trusteeâs regular meeting held on
that date.

The Board of Trustees recognizes the difficult financial circumstances
which determine the framework for your decisions as the Governor of our
state.  Indeed these are unprecedented economic times which require
impeccable prudence in your decisions regarding North Carolinaâs
future.  

Yet, our community colleges are positioned uniquely to provide a major
thrust in assisting North Carolinaâs return to economic stability. 
Enrollment increases this year are higher than at anytime in the
community college systemâs history.  At Rockingham Community College
alone, our 21 percent increase this year places us at an all-time high
in our 45-year history!  For our college, the 5 percent reduction
translates into nearly $490,000 that is desperately needed to provide
faculty for added class sections, additional equipment for training, and
technical support for classroom and administrative use.  Without these
funds, it is unrealistic to think that we can serve 21 percent more
students with less funds than were available two years agoâ¦without
compromising quality!

As president of the college and on behalf of the Board of Trustees, I
am asking that you give serious consideration to exempting the community
colleges from the terms of your Executive Order Number 21 including the
5 percent reduction in state allocations.  Our students, communities,
and colleges deserve this support as we endeavor to perform our critical
role in economic recovery and development for the future of North
Carolina.

Sincerely,

Robert C. Keys, President
Rockingham Community College

Dear Governor Perdue,

     I'm writing in my capacity as President of Alamance Community College to request that you consider exempting community colleges from the 5% reversion being implemented by Executive Order 21.  With community colleges initially taking a greater percentage cut (6.8%)  from last year's budget than public schools (5%) or the university system (5.8%), we started out in a worse position then either of the other two educational systems.

     Alamance Community College has experienced an 18% increase in headcount and a 22% increase in FTEs this fall over last fall.  Our county unemployment rate is currently  12.6% - higher than the State average.  We have worked diligently to insure we are providing classes for those who most need our services.  With such hefty enrollment increases, plus the 20% increase in tuition, the State has a very significant increase in tuition revenues going to the General Fund.  Where the universities are keeping their tuition revenue increase thus making their plight less urgent, we are not permitted to do so.

     If the 5% reversion is implemented, this will mean Alamance Community College will be required to return an additional $890K, on top of the management flexibility sum of $524K - all of this occurring at a time when we are trying to do our best to retrain those unemployed workers who are enrolling in unprecedented numbers.  We have made the commitment to absorb these additional students without increasing our class sizes, because many of these individuals are in need of developmental classes which necessitate a greater commitment of time from the instructors.  We have taken the drastic steps of adding 7 a.m. classes, because we are at room capacity during our normal operating times.  While we have increased online and hybrid courses, it still isn't enough to meet all the needs.  

     Any consideration you can give to exempting us from the 5% reversion would put us more in line with the university system's
 bottom line.  Our systemwide enrollment increases and tuition increase of 20% should come close to offsetting the 5% reversion amount.

     I thank you for your time reviewing this request.

Sincerely,


Martin H. Nadelman, Ed.D.

Alamance Community College

Please see the attached resolution opposing Executive Order 21, which was adopted by the Wilkes Community College (WCC) Board of Trustees at their meeting last evening. WCC board members agreed that getting the community colleges exempted from the additional 5% cut will make a major difference to every college and its ability to provide desperately needed services to citizens in our community as well as communities across the state.
