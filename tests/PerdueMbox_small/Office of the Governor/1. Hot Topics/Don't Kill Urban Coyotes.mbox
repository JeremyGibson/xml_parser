Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,

While it seems that coyotes wandering into homes have nothing to
do with North Carolina. However, we have had issues with bears,
foxes, and even just deer wandering around in urban settings and
in yards. It is important that we remember that we are crowding
in on their habitats, and that animals are not wandering into
&quot;our&quot; space just because. We are not the only living
things around, and we must share our space, especially as we
just moved in without thought to other species' needs. To keep
our communities safe, to maintain our reputation as a home for
wildlife, we MUST be smart about our growth.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands

Urban sprawl not only affects coyotes but other animals as well.
Deer, geese and many others have become &quot;urban&quot; due to
their habitats being encroached upon by suburban neighborhoods.
Then they are considered nuisances when they eat flowers and
shrubs or out of bird feeders. Not only that but with so many
homes left vacant due to the economy, new homes shouldn't be
built at a rate beyond which they can be sold anyway. I thank
you for your time and for considering my thoughts.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,

But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Please help encourage slow-down in urban sprawl. It is diluting
the beauty of our State that we all love. I'm for encouraging
better re-use of the land that has already been developed.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands

Find a better way to care for these animals rather than killing
them. We owe it to wildlife. We've diminished their
opportunities to thrive naturally. Can't we find a better way to
deal with inconveniences rather than eradication. The human
species does not have a mature conscious evolution - sadly.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,
Diane Gaudio
