Governor Beverly Perdue:

I would like to urge you to support the proposal to elect the President by a national popular vote in all 50 states (H1270).


When we vote for every other office, the candidate who gets the most votes wins. It should be the same for President.

Your truly,

Dear Gov. Perdue,

Thank you for standing up for justice through signing the Racial Justice Act into law.

Your public support set an example for governors across our country on that day. You should be proud for being on the right side of history and for offering such leadership for your peers and all citizens to follow.

Sincerely,

Dr. Sophia Kathariou
