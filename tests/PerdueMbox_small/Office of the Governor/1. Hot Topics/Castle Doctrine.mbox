Subject: North Carolina Castle Doctrine

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I would urge you to support a "Castle Doctrine" law as proposed by N.C. Senator Brock. Many of our surrounding states currently have approved this approach to self-defense without the doomsday predicted by anti-gun advocates. North Carolina's current self-defense laws are a legal nightmare that leave victims of dangerous criminals in a situation that can expose them to legal and financial ruin on one hand, or serious injury or worse on the other hand. Our current economic situation will only create an environment of increased criminal activity and risk of violence for innocent citizens. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Michael Jacques

Comment: Hello NRA is working with State Representative Mark Hilton (R-96) and State Senator Andrew Brock (R-34) to introduce "Castle Doctrine" self-defense bills, which will seek to allow law-abiding citizens to use the force they deem necessary against a violent criminal attacker to protect themselves wherever they have a legal right to be. The bill also provides civil immunity for those who defend themselves from criminal attack. Cosponsor the "Castle Doctrine" self-defense legislation when it is introduced and support passage of this critical reform. Thank you. Danny.

If I am following the law and someone enters my home who is not following the law and is acting in such a way that I or my family feel threatened, I should be able to take the appropriate action to protect myself or my family and if I am not convicted in criminal court, I should not be able to be tried civilly for the same charges.

Comment: Dear Governor; I doubt, busy as you are, that you would recall a waiter at the NCG&CC serving you who commented upon arrival at your table "oh, I should recognize you from the news!" about 21 years ago, but that was me. Over the years, you have garnered more than a few of my votes (one at a time,obviously) due to your being given an A+ by the NRA. It is with that in mind that I beg you to nudge emphatically, that deborah ross, who seems to have been bottling up the castle doctrine bill (oh, the number eludes me now- S928?) in committee. Dang, if we are not free to defend ourselves, how can we claim to be free? It was bad enough that milquestoasters erased the shoot fleeing felon law. Thanks for your time. Charlie

Subject: Please support "Castle Doctrine" law for North Carolinians

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: As a Democrat who voted for you, I'm writing to encourage you to support the establishment of clear "Castle Doctrine" law in North Carolina, as this issue is debated in the General Assembly. The recent news of the tragic home invasion and murders of two law-abiding homeowners in Florida is a reminder that the home is, or should be, a true 'safe place'; truly the place where loved ones should feel safe and be able to lawfully protect themselves against intruders into their home. Law-abiding citizens should be able, under the law, to use deadly force in protecting home and family from intruders, and we're hopeful that this bill will pass. I understand that not all homeowners are gunowners, but I believe that, just as North Carolina permits law-abiding citizens to own a gun for home protection or recreation, so should homeowners be supported under the law in meeting force with force if necessary, during a criminal home invasion and a criminal's unlawful breaking and entering into, and occupation of a home. This bill crosses all lines: Folks who work in town, or for gown (I work at Duke University) alike deserve the right to defend their homes, with the burden being placed on the criminals, not on ourselves for protecting family. Thank you for your hard work. Sincerely: Mike Garrison P.O. Box 108 Rougemont, NC 27572
