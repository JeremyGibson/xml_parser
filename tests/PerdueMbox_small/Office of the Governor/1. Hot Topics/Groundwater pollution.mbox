Dear Governor Perdue,

Please reject H1575, 'Accelerate Remediation', which weakens
standards for the cleanup of groundwater pollution.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters
shirk responsibility for spills. As North Carolina grows, we're
going to need all our groundwater resources. We can't afford to
write them off today as a subsidy to businesses that have been
careless. That's not fair to future generations, and it's not
fair to existing businesses that have taken appropriate care.
Please defeat H1575. We need clean groundwater. 


Sincerely,
Anne Marie Hurcomb

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Remediation of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal
with, corporations would spend less to avoid them, leading to
more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.
