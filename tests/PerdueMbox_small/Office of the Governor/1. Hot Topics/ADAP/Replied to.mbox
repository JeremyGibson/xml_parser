Subject: drastic cuts to NC ADAP (AIDS Drug Assistance Program)

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I was deeply disappointed and saddened to hear yesterday about the severe budget cuts that have just been made to the NC AIDS Drug Assistance Program. I run a clinic at Duke Law School that provides legal assistance to low-income HIV positive clients. Many many of our clients rely solely on the ADAP program for their medications--HIV meds and medications that treat mental illnesses, heart disease, diabetes, heart disease etc. I am convinced that these unexpected and sudden cuts will cost lives and will result in untold suffering by those already struggling with HIV/AIDS. I urge you to restore the money to ADAP immediately. I supported your candidacy, but this move has shaken me to my core. I cannot imagine a higher priority that your administration would have than saving lives and providing these crucial to those already suffering with HIV/AIDS. Thank you for considering this e-mail and the lives of those in NC living with HIV/AIDS. Carolyn McAllaster Clinical Professor of Law Duke University School of Law

Subject: ADAP cuts

Comment: I learned yesterday evening of the abrupt to cuts to the ADAP program and I am saddened and outraged. I am an attorney working exclusively with people with HIV/AIDS. These cuts are a death sentence for many of my clients. This may sound like hyperbole, but it isn't. These cuts will deprive many people of life-saving medications. Most obviously, closing ADAP to new applicants means that many people, low and middle income without health insurance, will be unable to obtain antiretroviral medications that keep them alive. In America, we have come to think of HIV as a "chronic" rather than fatal disease. But this is only true when someone is able to maintain a regimen of incredibly expensive antiretroviral medications. Without those medications, people die. From working with this population, I know that the people who die are the people who don't take medications. These cuts will add to that group. The second set of cuts will also lead to death for HIV patients, but perhaps not so directly. Tier 2 and 3 drugs, include anti-depressants and many other medications needed to treat co-morbidities, such as high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, and other conditions. Antiretrovirals are not enough to sustain people who need these other medications. Without antidepressants, people who might have their antiretroivals are much less likely to comply. Countless studies have documented the fact that mental illness is a barrier to compliance with HIV medications. You may reply that pharmaceutical patient assistance programs will fill that gap. This is a very naive notion. To obtain medications from these programs, patients must apply monthly, through an extremely complex and time-consuming process. Given that many people living with HIV/AIDS experience many barriers to care, including lack of education, social capital, transportation, money, stigma, mental illness, and substance abuse, it is clear that many people will be unable to avail themselves of patient assistance programs. As you know, people on ADAP are people who have no other access to insurance. So they are not able to turn to Medicaid to cover their medication costs. But these cuts cause them to become sicker, they will eventually become sick enough to qualify for Medicaid. And who will pay for that? Letting people with HIV get sick enough to qualify for Medicaid will just end up costing more in the end. There is another concern here: the public health. With an increasing population of people with HIV who are not taking antiretroviral medications, transmission of HIV is very likely to increase. Scientific studies show that people with more HIV virus are more infectious than those whose virus is controlled with antiretroviral treatment. So many of those people who are deprived of medications will spread this disease. This will result in more human suffering and cost to the state. This is a wrongheaded decision. It MUST be reversed.

Subject: AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Comment: Please restore $14 million to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, used to support thousands of HIV infected people's effort to receive life saving medications. The reduction by 30% of the funding for this program will result as many as a 1000 people having access to medication eliminated or never acquired. By 2003 use of the medications resulted in a benefit of 160 months of additional life per person [Walensky, 2006, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 194:11]. Intermittent use with (inconsistent access) will result in increased rates of resistant virus in our state. Salvage therapy is more expensive and hospitalizations are even more so. In the short term, please return the $14 million to the AIDS drug assistance program. In addition to the harm from the loss of funds, this loss jeopardizes the receipt of federal funding. If the state does not maintain its portion of the program, the money received from the federal government may be withdrawn. In the long term please negotiate reduced costs of the medication from the drug companies selling medications to the program. Ideally this should be done on a national level but it is imperative for maintaining access to medications that keep the NC population healthy. I am an HIV physician who has care for AIDS patients at UNC- Chapel Hill since 1985. I have seen the changes that follow the consistent use of effective therapy. I have seen what happens when insurance is out of reach. I am happy to discuss these concerns with someone in the governor's office including arranging a visit to an HIV clinic.

Comment: I have heard you have cut funding for HIV and AIDS meds for people who need assistance. I'm not sure if this is fact as yet, but I find this terrible and costly for when the state will have to pay for the numberous hospital stays these persons will have because they will not have the daily meds they need to maintain their virus. You have my address please send me info on what you plan to do for these citizens if you want my vote again next term.

Subject: NC ADAP PROGRAM

Comment: I work as a nurse in the Infectious Diseases Clinic at UNC Hospital and 95% of the patients I see in the clinic are HIV positive. Many are dependent on the NCADAP program for being able to obtain the medications. I am sure you are aware that the program is out of money to the point where new patients will be put on waiting lists and current patients will no longer be able to obtain life sustaining anti hypertensive agents, anti-diabetic medications, antidepressants medications, certain antibiotics as well as other medications. These are people that are 2 and 300% beyond poverty. To have to put new patients on a waiting list for HIV medications means that we will continue to have an even greater new infection rate of HIV in this state and will even discourage patients from getting tested if they know they can't get treatment. We are setting ourselves up for a much much greater predicament with this current policy. I BEG of you to find funding.

Subject: NC AIDS Drug Assistance Program

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a clinical social worker who has been working at UNC Hospitals Infectious Diseases Clinic for the past 7 years. It has come to our clinic's attention that the ADAP program, that we rely on for lifesaving medications for over 600 of our patients, is now implementing a waiting list and discontinuing all Tier 2 and Tier 3 medications that include antidepressants, Hep B and Hep C meds, anti-hypertensives and other critical medications. This is unacceptable and will result in a public health crisis that our state will be unable to handle. Without medications to control one's HIV viral load and fight off other infections, HIV will be spread in record numbers, not to mention other STI's. Without access to these medications, we will see an increase in hospitalizations and an incredible burden placed on facilities across our state. Hospitalizations cost far more than these medications and we will not have the room to even care for the amount of sick people this change will bring about. It is unacceptable for this program to instate a waiting list and discontinue Tier 2 and Tier 3 medications. These medications cannot just be stopped or there are serious and danger medical consequences. Please look further into this situation and help us on the ground level prevent this from happening. Thank you, Katherine Cooper, LCSW, LCAS

Subject: The Cap and Cuts to the ADAP

Comment: This is not a fix in any means to the budge, as patients will ultimently be hopitalized costing the state a lot more money then if the medications were continued and in coalition with the SPAP the ultimate cost will fall on the Federal Government, not the state. There will be patients that may die due to these cuts. I feel that is a travasity that could be avoided at a much lower cost to the state. I am one of the speakers that attended the meeting of the Gold Leaf Panel, attended by Senator William Purcell MD, and your self, and at this meeting to refresh your memory was at a nursing home in Morrisville, and you talked about your son not having insurance. At this meeting while you where still the President of the Senate, you told me in front of Senator Percell, that on your watch that ADAP would stay intact, I took that as a "Promice to the HIV community" I am truley apalled at your actions and feel that this is not a well thought out decession. I feel that any cuts in a Health Care Program should be of last resort, we can cut some money on some of the proposed new roads and get a grant from the tobacco stettlement money to keep this program solvent at a fraction of the cost of hospitalizations as a result of these cuts, I felt like we had a true Advocate in you to the ADAP program, and so you can understand my distress at the actions that have been taken in the past week. Thank You James Hayes

Comment: Hello. I am the director of the Ryan White Part C HIV medical clinic in Hickory. We have just learned of the drastic and devastating funding cuts for NC ADAP. This decision will negatively impact many lives. Many patients will go without medications and this will leave many people with failed drug regimens. Once a drug regimen has failed, that class of medications can not be used to treat that patient. With such a large focus on prevention of HIV transmission, I do not believe your administration wants to have so many people with untreated HIV. This funding decision has occurred so rapidly, we (those who provide assistance and care to those with HIV/AIDS) did not have time to adequately prepare options. Many people will go without their medications throughout the state. This decision has had a large negative impact on people living with HIV/AIDS, care providers and all those at risk to contract HIV. I respectfully ask that the administration re-consider this decision, allowing time for planning. Thank you. Michelle

Subject: AIDS Drug Assistance Program

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am completely aghast at the sudden, careless manner in which significant changes have been made to the program that provides life-saving medications to thousands of North Carolinians. I am fully aware that there are major budget short-falls, but it seems especially cruel to take medications from some of the poorest citizens of our state. I feel certain that the fact that they are the least likely to be able to protest was not missed by your administration. The fact is that when you take diabetic medications and heart medications away from the poor, the state will end up paying far more to hospitals when the patients are admitted and eventually qualify for Medicaid. The seven million dollars reportedly pulled from the ADAP budget will seem small when compared to the increases in Medicaid spending that are coming. As a social worker in the HIV clinic at Duke Univeristy Medical Center, I know first-hand how important the ADAP program is and how detrimental these changes are going to be. I have already had to start telling our patients that we MIGHT be able to get them medications from the drug manufacturers, but that it will be several weeks to months before that happens. I hope you will re-think these decisions and allow ADAP to re-open to new enrollees immediately and not cut the formulary. Sincerely, R. Scott Pollard, MSW, LCSW Clinical Care Coordinator

Subject: ADAP Changes Effective Immediately

Comment: Since 1987 I have been involved with persons living with HIV. A large part of my job was helping them to receive their medications. Most of the patients with whom I worked (and work) had no insurance, no Medicaid, and unable to afford any of their medications. ADAP, though not perfect, was a godsend. As I worked with the AIDS Care Advisory Council, ADAP continued to be improved and finally appeared to serve many of the medication needs that our poor, in some cases working clients needed. How depressing it is to be told, with no prior warning, that ADAP is closed to new enrollees and that the money is being pulled to support ADAP from the State. Do you not understand, that without this program, HIV-infected patients will be using the emergency room more than ever as their primary care, especially as they become sicker because they cannot afford their medications. You must restore the money to the ADAP program so that we can continue to support our patients with the life-saving medications that they so desperately need. By closing ADAP to new enrollees, you are turning the clock back at least 10 years. People will not want to be tested because they won't be able to receive their medications, costs will increase, patients will become resistant to their current medication regime, and result in costing the tax payers much more in reimbursed care than the currently do with on-going medication protection.

Subject: NC AIDS Drug Assistance Program

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am interested to know more about why the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) was suddenly closed on Friday 1/22/2010. As a physician assistant who provides primary and speciality care for HIV infected persons in North Carolina, I am very disturbed by your decision to close the ADAP program. You have taken away life saving medicines from people who do not have the health insurance coverage or other resources to pay for their antiretrovirals. This WILL translate to lives lost. In addition, by not giving antiretrovirals to people who are HIV infected you will increase the number of new cases of HIV infection in North Carolina. It is well proven that HIV positive persons on treatment with antiretrovirals are significantly less likely to infect someone else because the antiretrovirals suppress virus levels in blood and sexual fluids. You have a made a decision that will have a profound effect on our public's health. I ask you, urge you, beg you to please reconsider and reopen the ADAP program. At the very least, an explanation is warranted. Sincerely, Kara McGee, PA-C, MPH

Subject: ADAP changes

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, This correspondence is not so much a question as a heartfelt ple to reconsider the budget changes in funding for the NC ADAP. As a HIV clinician who sees patients in both Raleigh and Chapel Hill, I can emphaticially state that this change will harm individuals with HIV. Not allowing HIV providers in NC the ability to enroll new patients into ADAP will mean that many will simply go without, resulting in preventable complications, and many requiring hospitalization. Although mindful of the difficult choices which you and others face with the budget, taking away care for an incurable and life-threatening illness seems a poor and unacceptable choice. I beseech you to be an advocate for these patients, many of whom do not have the means to be united and vocal lobbyists for themselves. I would ask you to ask yourself if such a decrease in care would ever occur for a condition which does not largely affects individuals in lower socioeconomic classes. Please reconsider.

Comment: This is an incredibly short-sighted decision. No medication for HIV+ individuals equals higher viral loads (which means people are MORE contagious), more ER visits and hospitalizations (opportunistic infections, including pneumonia), and reduced work capacity (which means fewer taxes coming in). It's like cutting prenatal care to save money, which has been proven to be counterproductive and far more expensive in the long run. And let's not forget that stopping medication because you can't afford it can lead to resistant strains of HIV. Penny wise but pound foolish.

Subject: Changes in NC AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) will hurt patients

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: As an HIV care provider at UNC Hospitals, I am very concerned about the recent and abrupt changes in the state's ADAP coverage. I understand that the elimination of the tier 2 and 3 medications (those used to treat side-effects and comorbidities from HIV and HIV treatment) may be necessary to contain escalating costs from new enrollees in the setting of the economic downturn. Realistically, options may exist for some of these medications on generic and reduced-cost plans offered through large pharmacies - but there are no other options for anti-HIV medications themselves. The plans to limit new enrollment into ADAP are distressing. A substantial number of people diagnosed with HIV in North Carolina learn of their infection during the latest stages of the disease (full-blown AIDS) and these patients require medication simply in order to survive. Further, the more we learn about HIV management, the more evidence supports treatment with medications before patients reach advanced stages of disease. The medical literature has evolved quickly over the past 3-5 years, and the consensus is rapidly growing among experts in the field that patients should be treated earlier - essentially as soon as they are diagnosed. With the elimination of new enrollment, the State is turning its back on medical evidence and saying to patients living with HIV that it does not care whether or not they get sick. Cost-efficacy surely suggests that the cost of treatment up-front outweighs the exorbitant costs of recurrent hospitalizations and critical care for patients whose disease advances without the benefit of treatment. I urge you to discuss the ADAP changes with other HIV healthcare professionals, and to talk to people living with HIV about how these medications have literally brought some of them back from the verge of death to lead healthy lives and return to productivity in our society. It is an unfortunate statement that a North Carolinian diagnosed with HIV today, in the setting of ADAP contraction, is less likely to have access to life-saving and life-prolonging medication than a patient living overseas in a country receiving PEPFAR support. We in the United States and here in North Carolina should be the model for how HIV care is delivered worldwide. Instead, yet again the message to those living with HIV is that their lives aren't worth the expense. Regards, Christopher Hurt, MD

Subject: Sudden Funding Cut within HIV ADAP Program

Comment: As the Office of the Governor may already be aware, as of 1/25/10, some major changes were made to NC's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). These changes were sudden, drastic and will deeply effect individuals living with HIV/AIDS in NC who have little or no other means to obtain life-saving medications. I work at an medical clinic serving these individuals. Like other NC HIV agencies, we have limited resources (staff/funding, etc.), and have a very difficult task ahead of us in seeking medication assistance for individuals living with HIV disease. My hope is that you will consider addtitional ermergency ADAP funding in order for the NC AIDS Care Unit to continue offering this invaluable service.

Subject: AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Crisis

Comment: Governor Perdue, the sudden closure of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program is unconscionable. As a social worker in an infectious disease clinic, I serve almost 500 people on this program. The sudden closure, while allowing those already enrolled to keep getting their HIV medications endangers their health by taking away medications for hepatitis, diabetes, hypertension, seizure disorder and psychiatric disorders--the last one immediately related to adherence to other medications and affecting the public health. Even if all of these patients could be enrolled in pharmaceutical patient assistance programs (they cannot), there is no time to do so with this sudden decision by the State. ADAP had assured us up until the week before this happened that the program was financially sound, and we had passed this message on to consumers, who are now desperate. And then there are the new enrollees who will languish on a waiting list in order to get lifesaving medications. If this really is due to a gradual increase in enrollment, then why did this happen so suddenly? Who is responsible? I plead with you to undo this decision that is disastrous for those enrolled in the program, for those who need to be enrolled in the program, for hospital emergency rooms who will have to deal with these patients as they get sicker, and for the public health--well controlled HIV in the population benefits us all. This unwise decision simply must be reversed immediately. Thank you for your attention. Gordon Lipscomb

Subject: ADAP program changes

Comment: I am writing as a Licensed Professional Counselor and Licensed Clinical Addictions Specialist. I just heard of the abrupt changes coming to the ADAP program. I want your office to know I think this is an outrage and will cause incredible suffering for program recipients. I strongly disapprove of dropping people off Tier 2 and 3 drugs almost immediately and terminating enrollment for new people who need ADAP. I am deeply saddened and angered by this move. I have seen horrendous fall-out affects of untreated or improperly treated HIV/AIDS cases. I know the State of North Carolina does not want to increase HIV transmission rates, deteriorate mental health and escalate addiction issues, yet it seems to be what is happening. Please, Governor Perdue, reconsider this change. Sincerely, Mary Beth Rabon, LPC, LCAS, CCJP

Subject: ADAP program

Comment: I am very upset that the ADAP program is losing its funding. Clients rely on ADAP in order to get there HIV meds and other meds that a lot of HIV positive get. The ADAP program is doing away with Tier 2 and 3 drugs and this will be very costly to our clients. The clients have no income or are on a fixed income. Some of the meds that are on that list antidepressants meds, antilipidemics meds, anti hypertensive meds, anti-diabetics meds, vaccines, hep C treatment and Hep B treatment. That is not all of them but can you get an idea of how this is going to hurt the people on ADAP. This will surely increase the cost for treatment because we will have more people suffering from High Blood pressure. More people will be depressed and so many other mental health issues will be a disaster. I can even see the crime rates going up because of this. Please is there anything that can be done so that we can have out ADAP program back unchanged from what is just was?

Subject: Cutting ADAP

Comment: Mrs. Governor, I am an HIV nurse at UNC Hospital and I was shocked to hear that the state is cutting ADAP funds for new patients as well as taking vital drugs off the ADAP formulary. This is a huge problem for our HIV population. I disagree completely with this descision and ask that you please find another way for the state to save money. Taking funds away from HIV treatment programs will only cause the epidemic to grow and it'll create a much bigger and serious health disaster for this state. Please re-evaluate your decision.

Subject: ADAP PROGRAM

Comment: I am a volunteer for HIV/AIDES of 51 years. I am begging for you to find ways not to cut funding for the ADAP program. There is a growing need in some communities and without the states assistance some of these clients never get treated. And you know if they are never treated the disease continues to spread. We work hard trying to reach out and educate the communities but to cut off the assistance of those who are already effective, what hope do we give them.

Subject: AIDS Drug Assistance Program

Comment: Good Afternoon - I am contacting the Office of the Governor today in response to the news this past week that no new enrollments will be allowed to the state's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). As an HIV positive resident of North Carolina, I am appalled to realize that the lives of HIV positive people in North Carolina who are not able to afford life saving anti-retriviral medicines will not be allowed to enroll in this extremely important program. I am sure, I will not get a personal reply, but I had to make my voice heard none-the-less. Understanding that the state is in a budgetary crisis, I can't believe there are other programs that cannot be trimmed to save the state's ADAP. ADAP is a lifeline to individuals who have no where else to turn. Local AIDS service organizations don't have the funds to purchase very costly medicines, and those of us who do have insurance, cannot afford to donate any unused medicine, because we need them ourselves. In the state of North Carolina, approximately 23,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS, 4,400 (20%) of them are currently enrolled in ADAP. With over 60,000 new infections annually, and one in four of HIV infected people do not even know they are infected, ADAP is increasingly more important. I am imploring Governor Perdue to do something, now. We cannot sit back and allow our mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters living with HIV to be denied the right to life saving medicines. I hope that this note does not indeed fall on deaf ears, I hope that the Governor will do the right thing and work with the state legislature to re-instate ADAP funding. Respectfully, Jeromy A. Dunn www.pozitivelyspeaking.com jeromy@pozitivelyspeaking.com 704-488-9959

Dear Governor Perdue,

I was dismayed to learn that the North Carolina AIDS Drug
Assistance Program (ADAP) was recently closed to new enrollees. 

Low-income, HIV positive, uninsured North Carolinians not
currently enrolled in ADAP will be unable to obtain life-saving
HIV medications through ADAP. 

I am writing to urge you to take urgent action by immediately
releasing the 4 million dollars currently being held in reserve
by DHHS from the 11 million appropriated for ADAP by the
Legislature

ADAP saves lives. Without access to antiretroviral medications,
people living with HIV face serious health consequences,
including death. Those consequences will also cost the state
money, driving up Medicaid costs.

Access it HIV medications is a proven prevention strategy as
well, significantly reducing the rick of transmission and
resistance.

Please, take action now to save lives and restore funding to
ADAP.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I was dismayed to learn that the North Carolina AIDS Drug
Assistance Program (ADAP) was recently closed to new enrollees. 

Low-income, HIV positive, uninsured North Carolinians not
currently enrolled in ADAP will be unable to obtain life-saving
HIV medications through ADAP. 

I am writing to urge you to take urgent action by immediately
releasing the 4 million dollars currently being held in reserve
by DHHS from the 11 million appropriated for ADAP by the
Legislature

ADAP saves lives. Without access to antiretroviral medications,
people living with HIV face serious health consequences,
including death. Those consequences will also cost the state
money, driving up Medicaid costs.

Access it HIV medications is a proven prevention strategy as
well, significantly reducing the rick of transmission and
resistance.

Please, take action now to save lives and restore funding to
ADAP.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I was dismayed to learn that the North Carolina AIDS Drug
Assistance Program (ADAP) was recently closed to new enrollees. 

It seems to me to be shortsighted to prevent access to a program
that would prevent medical complications. It also seems
punitive, and may be discriminatory.
