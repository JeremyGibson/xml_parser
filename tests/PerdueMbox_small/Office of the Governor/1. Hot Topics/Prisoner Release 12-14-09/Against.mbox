God bless you for standing up for victims.  A life sentence is a life sentence, just as the life sentence each victim got.  We are impressed with the job you have done so far on everything.

Subject: Blocking Killer Inmate Releases

Comment: Governor Perdue: THANKS AND PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. I am a 66 year old grandmother and I would like to thank you for your firm stance to not release these killers. For a very long time I have been a proponent for the death penalty and this is the main reason. I am tired of killers being sentenced to "life". They get to keep their lives and get supported by my taxes, and then somewhere down the road, they get released and get to continue their life out in society. Their victims were given a death sentence at their hands and their families have been given a life sentence without their loved one and they will never get a release from that. We should also look back to the incident in Washington two weeks ago where a killer inmate was released (just as the supporters of these killers are requesting) and now we have four dead law enforcement officers. A "life" sentence should mean EXACTLY that and certainly credit for "good behavior" should NEVER be given. Why wouldn't a killer be a "good" prisoner for a few years if it means they can get back on the streets? Again, thanks for standing up to this insanity.

We are parents of a son that is a police officer in P.A.,and do not believe anyone serving a life sentence should walk out of jail. While these people may walk out maybe something can be done to change the future. Sincerely: Louis Schum

Subject: prisoner release ruling

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I just wanted to thank you for expressing your outrage tonight over the ruling by the Court of Appeals on the *release* of inmates sentenced to life in prison. I was shocked that this could happen in our state. I believe that "life" in prison means "life" - or 80 years. I believe that the juries that convicted these people believed that as well when they were sentenced. It sounds like something is seriously wrong with the "credits for good behavior" policy in our prison systems. It is simply not fathomable that prisoners who have committed *murder* could get their sentences reduced for "behaving" in prison, when they did not "behave" when they were free. When, in fact, they took the lives of innocent people. And to reduce their sentences by half?? Their victims were not given this generosity, and I don't believe any of these prisoners shoud be released. Please, please, please continue to do all that you can to fight this. It is an outrage to the citizens of North Carolina. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Rebecca Darr

My cousin Elizabeth will never be able to walk out of her grave, therefore I see no reason he or anybody elst who has taken the life of someone be allowed to ever see the light of day outside prison wall. I want to thank you for standing your ground about the prisioners now that the state wants to allow to walk free. To be honest with you and please forgive me of my laguage -- But I pray that they will rot in hell...........................

I would like to commend Gov. Perdue for stopping the release of the convicted criminals.  May she be able to continue in seeing that the sentences are not commuted and that the criminals are held to the original sentence.  It's encouraging to see our Governor standing up for what is right! More power to her!!

24,000 Census Jobs Available for North Carolina

Gov. Perdue on Wednesday announced that 24,000 Census jobs will be available throughout North Carolina and signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=814>Executive Order No. 33 creating the North Carolina Complete Count Committee to coordinate Census activities at the state level. 

âMore than $400 billion in federal funds will be distributed each year based on the census count, so a complete count is critical to North Carolina,â Perdue said.  âI urge everyone to fill out and mail back their Census forms.  Itâs easy, itâs important and itâs secure.â

The decennial census will take place on April 1, 2010.  It is administered by the federal government, but requires support at the state and local level.  The stateâs activities are coordinated by the stateâs Complete Count Committee (CCC).  Individual localities also establish complete count committees, in order to coordinate participation in the census.

The Census Bureau will be hiring for 24,000 jobs throughout North Carolina beginning in January 2010.  Job seekers can find application information at <http://www.2010censusjobs.gov/>www.2010censusjobs.gov or by calling 1-866-861-2010.  The information is also available via the <https://www.ncesc.com/default.aspx>Employment Security Commission or <http://jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW.nc.gov.  Some jobs will begin as early as January, while most will begin in February and March, and will extend until June or July.

Over $400 billion in federal funds will be allocated annually based on the 2010 Census figures.  Based on recent estimates, the state will receive approximately $14,000 in federal funding per person counted over the next 10 years.  In addition, Census data is the basis for the NC State Demographerâs projections, which are used to determine the distribution of state funds. 

The Census will also determine whether North Carolina will receive an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  North Carolina narrowly received a 13th congressional district after the 2000 Census by margin of approximately 800 people.

Governor Announces Steps to Strengthen Ethical Standards for State Boards and Commissions

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed three executive orders to increase ethical standards for gubernatorial appointees to state boards and commissions and for certain designated employees.  These orders continue to strengthen the commitment to transparent and effective government that began with Gov. Perdueâs first day in office.

The new standards include a measure to remove gubernatorial appointees indicted for a felony or who refuse to cooperate with a state or federal investigation.

âThese orders are another step forward in my commitment to enforce the highest standards of ethics, accountability and transparency in this administration,â said Perdue.  âOur citizens deserve nothing less than a transparent, effective and efficient government that works for North Carolinians.â

Additionally, the executive orders establish an attendance standard of 75% of regularly scheduled meetings for boards and commissions, and they extend the Ethics Act to an array of public servants who not otherwise be covered.

Other standards established by Executive Orders Nos. <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=816>34, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=817>35 and <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=818>36 include:

â¢ Governorâs appointees to boards and commissions cannot accept gifts from those who contract with their boards, and they must recues themselves from votes in which they have a financial interest.

â¢ New conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements for 17 specific advisory boards and commissions not covered by the State Ethics Act.

Logistics Task Force Formed

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=815>Executive Order No. 32, establishing the Governorâs Logistics Task Force.  The task force will make recommendations to ensure that people and goods are able to move efficiently across North Carolina.  The order was signed at a signing ceremony at the Raleigh headquarters of Longistics, a full-service provider of global logistics services.

âWe must have an efficient and effective transportation system to move our people, to create jobs, and to be sure our economy is globally competitive in the 21st century,â said Perdue.  âTransportation is a major part of why North Carolina continues to be named the #1 state in America for business.â

The Logistics Task Force will review transportation systems in North Carolina including roads and highways, airports, ports, multimodal transportation and railroads.  The review will focus on giving North Carolina a competitive advantage in economic development by maximizing existing transportation systems and defining priorities for future transportation investments.  Lt. Governor Walter Dalton will serve as Chair of the Logistics Task Force.

âThe Logistics Task Force is going to preserve and create jobs,â said Dalton.  âThe ability to move goods, people and information efficiently and cost effectively is crucial to existing companies and emerging industries in North Carolina.â

The Logistics Task Force is part of Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative to aggressively create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Annual Christmas Tree Lighting

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue joined Santa Claus and hundreds of children and their families in the annual lighting of the Christmas tree on the State Capitol grounds.  The event also marked the beginning of the Holiday Open House for the Executive Mansion - which ends on Sunday, Dec. 13.  Visit our <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/>eTownhall blog for pictures, video and news of the holiday events. 


Textile Firm to Bring 66 Jobs to Burke County

Marves Industries, an international producer of non-woven textile cushioning and insulator pads for use in mattresses headquartered in Mexico, will open a new North American facility in Burke County.  The company will invest $1.75 million and create 66 jobs in Hildebran.  The announcement was made possible by a $200,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

âNorth Carolina continues to attract international manufacturing firms seeking the perfect U.S. location to invest and grow,â Gov. Perdue said.  âOur stateâs trained workforce, top business climate and exceptional quality of life are spurring companies to expand here and create the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.â 

North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative, the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain workers, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information on Marves, go to <http://www.marves.com/>www.marves.com.  For information about job opportunities with this company, contact:  Cindy Foster at (828) 397-4400 or send a resume to Marves Industries, Attn: Cindy Foster, P.O. Box 946, Hildebran, NC 28637.

The Census Bureau will be hiring for 24,000 jobs throughout North Carolina beginning in January 2010.  Job seekers can find application information at <http://www.2010censusjobs.gov/>www.2010censusjobs.gov or by calling 1-866-861-2010.  The information is also available via the <https://www.ncesc.com/default.aspx>Employment Security Commission or <http://jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW.nc.gov.  Some jobs will begin as early as January, while most will begin in February and March, and will extend until June or July.

Over $400 billion in federal funds will be allocated annually based on the 2010 Census figures.  Based on recent estimates, the state will receive approximately $14,000 in federal funding per person counted over the next 10 years.  In addition, Census data is the basis for the NC State Demographerâs projections, which are used to determine the distribution of state funds. 

The Census will also determine whether North Carolina will receive an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  North Carolina narrowly received a 13th congressional district after the 2000 Census by margin of approximately 800 people.

Governor Announces Steps to Strengthen Ethical Standards for State Boards and Commissions

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday signed three executive orders to increase ethical standards for gubernatorial appointees to state boards and commissions and for certain designated employees.  These orders continue to strengthen the commitment to transparent and effective government that began with Gov. Perdueâs first day in office.

The new standards include a measure to remove gubernatorial appointees indicted for a felony or who refuse to cooperate with a state or federal investigation.

âThese orders are another step forward in my commitment to enforce the highest standards of ethics, accountability and transparency in this administration,â said Perdue.  âOur citizens deserve nothing less than a transparent, effective and efficient government that works for North Carolinians.â

Additionally, the executive orders establish an attendance standard of 75% of regularly scheduled meetings for boards and commissions, and they extend the Ethics Act to an array of public servants who not otherwise be covered.

Other standards established by Executive Orders Nos. <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=816> 34, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=817> 35 and <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=818> 36 include:

â¢ Governorâs appointees to boards and commissions cannot accept gifts from those who contract with their boards, and they must recues themselves from votes in which they have a financial interest.

â¢ New conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements for 17 specific advisory boards and commissions not covered by the State Ethics Act.

Logistics Task Force Formed

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=815> Executive Order No.. 32, establishing the Governorâs Logistics Task Force.  The task force will make recommendations to ensure that people and goods are able to move efficiently across North Carolina.  The order was signed at a signing ceremony at the Raleigh headquarters of Longistics, a full-service provider of global logistics services.

âWe must have an efficient and effective transportation system to move our people, to create jobs, and to be sure our economy is globally competitive in the 21st century,â said Perdue.  âTransportation is a major part of why North Carolina continues to be named the #1 state in America for business.â

The Logistics Task Force will review transportation systems in North Carolina including roads and highways, airports, ports, multimodal transportation and railroads.  The review will focus on giving North Carolina a competitive advantage in economic development by maximizing existing transportation systems and defining priorities for future transportation investments.  Lt. Governor Walter Dalton will serve as Chair of the Logistics Task Force.

âThe Logistics Task Force is going to preserve and create jobs,â said Dalton.  âThe ability to move goods, people and information efficiently and cost effectively is crucial to existing companies and emerging industries in North Carolina.â

The Logistics Task Force is part of Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative to aggressively create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Annual Christmas Tree Lighting

On Thursday, Gov. Perdue joined Santa Claus and hundreds of children and their families in the annual lighting of the Christmas tree on the State Capitol grounds.  The event also marked the beginning of the Holiday Open House for the Executive Mansion - which ends on Sunday, Dec. 13.  Visit our <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/>eTownhall blog for pictures, video and news of the holiday events. 


Textile Firm to Bring 66 Jobs to Burke County

Marves Industries, an international producer of non-woven textile cushioning and insulator pads for use in mattresses headquartered in Mexico, will open a new North American facility in Burke County.  The company will invest $1.75 million and create 66 jobs in Hildebran.  The announcement was made possible by a $200,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

âNorth Carolina continues to attract international manufacturing firms seeking the perfect U.S. location to invest and grow,â Gov. Perdue said.  âOur stateâs trained workforce, top business climate and exceptional quality of life are spurring companies to expand here and create the good jobs our citizens have come to expect.â 

North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative, the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain workers, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information on Marves, go to <http://www.marves.com/>www.marves.com.  For information about job opportunities with this company, contact:  Cindy Foster at (828) 397-4400 or send a resume to Marves Industries, Attn: Cindy Foster, P.O. Box 946, Hildebran, NC 28637.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I just wanted you to know how very impressed I am with the way you are standing up against the release of prison inmates.   I am a victim of a violent crime.  My father was murdered in Durham, NC at the age of 95 by a 19 year old black man in 2000.  My dad was still living alone, had an incredible mind, drove his own car, and took care of all his personal business.   If he had died a natural death at that age, we could have accepted that.  He was one of the best Christian men you would ever meet, yet he had to go through a terrible death before he left this earth.  His killer slit his throat, drove around with him in the car, dumped him behind a furniture store (wasn't found until the next day), and abandoned the car later.  Jason was given "life without parole".  Does this mean that if he earns points for good behavior that he ultimately could be paroled at some point if the judiciary so decides?!!    

We, the victims, feel that our needs are not addressed at all.  From the time the crime happens, everything is about the "criminal".  Our lives were changed forever.  Not a day passes that I don't think about my dad and what he had to endure during his last moments of life.  For one year we were at the court every month at least once, maybe more, as he made his court appearances.  It was over a year before the case came to a resolution.  And - that was good according to the time element involved with many cases.  I was in touch with a young woman whose father was murdered in Durham a year after my dad's death, and they had to wait much longer - enduring two trials before things were resolved according to the courts.  I can't say that justice was served because the killer confessed, but other stumbling blocks prevented things from happening as they should have happened. 

There is never "closure" for victims!   As long as these criminals are in prison, one never knows what might happen in the future.   I am sure that you do not want to be responsible for allowing criminals to be released who may go out and murder someone else - as was the case with the four policemen who were murdered in the state of Washington after being released by Gov. Huckabee.  I do not believe that a killer can be rehabilitated.  I hope that their lives can be changed to a belief in God and asking for forgiveness of their sins, but - that still does not give them their release from the courts.  How much is a life worth?   Not very much in these times, it seems.

Keep up the good work.  It takes real strength to stand up for what you believe.  I believe you have that strength.  Many will be praying for you.

Sincerely yours,

Dee (Dolores) Tucker

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.

Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudillâs ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Randâs decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.

In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."

Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.

Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudillâs decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Courtâs decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

We'll work on jobs, but in the interin, "DIG IN" on the release of these prisoners sentenced in the 70s.  Life sentence is life.. The 70s Legislature should be punished for passing a law like they did.

Electrolux to Create at Least 738 Jobs in Mecklenburg County

Electrolux expects to create a minimum of 738 jobs over the next five years and invest $8.3 million in a new North American headquarters in Charlotte. The announcement was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant and a One North Carolina Fund award.

Electrolux looked across America to choose a location for a North American headquarters and they chose Charlotte, North Carolina, said Gov. Perdue.  Once again this states tremendous workforce and top business climate attracted a globally competitive company.

Electrolux is a global leader in home and professional appliances whose products include refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers and cooking products sold primarily under the Electrolux, Frigidaire and Eureka brands in North America.

The company will consolidate corporate offices from around the country into the new Charlotte headquarters. Electrolux currently employs around 650 people in North Carolina, the majority at a dishwasher manufacturing plant in Kinston.

Risk Management Consultant to Create 430 Jobs in RTP

International risk management consultant IEM will move its headquarters from Baton Rouge, La., to Durham County, creating 430 jobs over the next six years.

As a technology hub with a vast military presence, the relocation of IEM to North Carolina is a perfect fit that will benefit both the company and the state, Perdue said. This partnership is another step in creating the top-paying, knowledge-based jobs that I am committed to bringing to North Carolina.

IEM is a privately held company that provides risk-based solutions for measuring and managing threats to people, infrastructure and information. Since IEMs founding in 1985, it has provided emergency management, homeland security, military and information technology solutions to federal governmental agencies including the U.S. Department of Defense, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services and as well as working with cities, ports and the private sector.

The 430 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $62,778 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Durham County annual average of $57,772.

Governor Reestablishes N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday signed Executive Order No. 41 reestablishing the N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service.  The order was signed while Gov. Perdue participated in a home refurbishing volunteer project in Asheville.

> This year, more than any other time in our lives, our neighbors and communities need all of us to reach out with a helping hand, said Perdue.  As governor Ive asked all North Carolinians to make service a way of life.  Were reenergizing this important group and getting more businesses and community members engaged in service.

> The N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service, first established in 1994, is charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive statewide service plan for promoting and recognizing volunteerism in North Carolina.  In addition, the Commission administers four volunteer programs; AmeriCorps, Governors Page Program, Governors Volunteer Service Awards, and Citizen Corps.

> As Governor, Bev Perdue has made volunteerism and community service a priority.  In addition, to todays project in Asheville, Gov. Perdue has participated in a number of volunteer activities including reading to children, planting a garden for the hungry, and serving Meals-on-Wheels.  She has also called on family, staff and all North Carolinians to become more involved in their communities.

> For more information about the N.C. Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service, visit <http://www.volunteernc.org>www.volunteernc.org.

> Online Learning Report Shows N.C. Virtual Public School Fifth in the Nation in Enrollments

A new report 2009 Keeping Pace with K-12 Online Learning lists North Carolinas Virtual Public School (NCVPS) the fifth largest virtual school in terms of enrollment.  In just two and a half years, the school has become one of the fastest growing virtual schools in the nation, topping 20,000 in enrollments by the fall of 2009.

> Technology is revolutionizing the way we live and work  and Im committed to using it to revolutionize the way we teach and learn, said Perdue.  Im proud of what we have accomplished here in North Carolina, and Im looking forward to seeing enrollments continue to grow for the NC Virtual Public School.

> North Carolina continues to see rapid growth of over 50 percent per year in virtual school enrollments.  The Fall 2008 and Spring  2009 terms posted more than 15,700 enrollments, while the Summer and Fall 2009 terms saw enrollment surge to the current levels above 20,000.

> The roots of the NCVPS were established in 2002, when the General Assembly created the Business Education Technology Alliance (BETA) and charged it with ensuring that the effective use of technology is built into the North Carolina School System for the purpose of preparing a globally competitive workforce and citizenry for the 21st century.   The BETA Commission, under the leadership of then- Lt. Governor Bev Perdue, established the E-Learning Commission and charged it with establishing the North Carolina Virtual Public School.  The NCVPS offered its first online courses starting in June 2007.   For more information, visit <http://www.ncvps.org>www.ncvps.org.

> North Carolina Number One in National Board Certified Teachers

Gov. Bev Perdue announced that North Carolina once again leads the nation in the total number of teachers who have earned certification by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards with 15,695 teachers now certified. This group of teachers accounts for nearly 19 percent of all the 83,359 National Board Certified teachers in the nation.  North Carolina also ranked first in the nation in the number of newly-certified teachers, as the state is home to 1,509 of the 8,874 educators nationwide who earned the recognition this year.

> National Board Certified teachers are essential to helping transform North Carolina's schools," said Gov. Bev Perdue. Fifteen years ago our state saw its first group of teachers achieve National Board Certification.  We continue to be the nations leader as nearly 16,000 have earned this hallmark distinction. Throughout the years, I have seen first-hand how these outstanding educators have changed the culture of teaching and learning in their classrooms and their schools.   Most importantly, research shows that National Board Certified Teachers can be a valuable learning resource to all students, especially students who need them the most.

> National Board Certification, the highest credential in the teaching profession, requires an extensive series of performance-based assessments including teaching portfolios, student work samples, videotapes and thorough analyses of the candidates' classroom teaching and student learning. Teachers also complete a series of written exercises that probe the depth of their subject-matter knowledge, as well as their understanding of how to teach those subjects to their students.

> National Board Certification was first offered in 1994, when eight North Carolina teachers achieved this professional credential. Since then, the number of teachers in the state receiving the certification has continued to grow. North Carolina has led the nation in the number of National Board Certified teachers for 14 years. The other states in the top three this year are Florida, with 13,281 and South Carolina, with 7,293 certified teachers.

> Governor Calls on Federal Government to Ease Credit for Small Businesses

Gov. Bev Perdue today called on North Carolinas Congressional Delegation to support steps to ease the credit crisis facing North Carolinas small businesses.  Gov. Perdues #1 priority is creating jobs in North Carolina, and helping small businesses grow is critical to creating jobs.

> Small businesses are the backbone of North Carolinas economy, said Perdue.  It is critical that we get credit flowing back to small businesses to work our way out of this economic and financial crisis.

> In a letter to the N.C. Congressional Delegation, Gov. Perdue asked for federal government support for North Carolinas efforts to increase lending to North Carolina small businesses.  Specifically, the federal government should:

>  Identify sources of capital, such as unspent TARP funds, that can be repurposed and deployed through banks specifically for small business lending.

>  Extend the availability of 90% no fee SBA-backed small business loans, and ease the regulatory pressures applied to lenders to bring credit access back within reach of the many viable businesses that need it.

>  Consider tax incentives for small businesses that create jobs as a result of federally-backed loans.

> In 2006, small businesses accounted for 98% of employers and 49% of private-sector employees in North Carolina.

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I have been keeping up with the case I mentioned in the subject line and would like to know what can I do to help you keep these criminals incarcerated. I am in total agreement with you and the supreme court. They should never be let out to become another menance to or on society again.

Subject: Lifers

Comment: I agree: Life behind bars should mean life behind bars. I am not so sure that most life sentences should not be changed to termination immediately but I guess that there are cases that might be found to be incorrectly decided. Still the expense of giving a lifer free room and board for years and years seems unfair to those of us who have to pay those bills.

Subject: Opinions on Recent Decisions

Comment: Gov Perdue, I am a political INDEPENDENT . I vote and support candidates across both party lines .I have been both satisfied and terribly dismayed by decisions made by Republicans and Democrats. On the issue of life sentences I FULLY support and APPLAUD the position you have taken. A life sentence should mean, a life sentence. Granting time off for good behavior for people sentenced for murder is an absurdity. It is unfortunate that "time back to life" cannot be granted to their victims for their good behavior. This loop hole in the law must be corrected immediately. This is one reason I now fully support the implementation of the death penalty. On a similar issue, I am left absolutely outraged when I hear about the rapes, killings and other crimes committed by criminals on probation/parole, These systems have become TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL. They must be completely shut down until a FULLY FUNCTIONAL system can be brought on line to protect the lives of the citizens of North Carolina. If we need more prisons, build them! I will pay taxes for that. Don't unleash these criminals into our communities. If they could you,Eve Carson,and the others would tell you the same thing.

Dear Governor Pardue,
Thank you so much for taking such a brave stand to protect the citizens of North Carolina and uphold the laws which were made to not be broken.  You have shown what a true governor of North Carolina should be.  It's about time the "good ole boy" system is abolished and what's right for the citizens of this great state is put ahead of greed and power.
Bravo, dear Governor!
Sincerely,
Catherine Iseley Andrews

Office of the

UPDATE:

We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential

release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important

developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.











Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland

County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur

Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose

sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudillâs

ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Randâs decision earlier this

week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.











In his decision, Judge Caudill

ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior

credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life

sentence."











Additionally, the state Supreme

Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and

will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to

decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.











Governor

Perdue believes Judge Caudillâs decision is the correct one as this

important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.











The

Supreme Courtâs decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks

a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a

proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains:

inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door

without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudills ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rands decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

This is truly good news as it has always been my opinion that life should mean just that and not twenty or twenty five yars or maybe even less depending on who is deciding at that particular time.

THANK YOU!  If they should EVER let those people go free I would never

Dear Governor Perdue.  I am so happy to hear the silent majority finally begin to rise up and protest against a bureacracy whos moral compass is about 150 off kilter.

Wheras our family is thrilled and thank your sanity and for your effort.  We want to know how we can get the Justice system back in step with the true constitution.  How do we get rid of poor judges like Ripley Rand.  If my history is correct, I think Thomas Jefferson and James Madison tossed out about 1/2 the judges in thier time! 

Thanks again from a registered Republican who reads and supports most of your adgenda.

That is good news.  I do not feel it is appropriate for a single judge to over-rule the 12-man jury. If  jury rules a lifetime, without parole, that should be the final word for that inmate, unless later information is found that would counter the information that a jury received. Thank you, Governor, for your postings.  I appreciate them.

Finally, youve done something correct.

Now, why dont you try voting NO to ruining our healthcare!!! Oh, I forgot, youre a Dem which means you can only go with Obamas demands, rather than have a mind of your own.

Office of the Governor

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudills ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rands decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudills decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Courts decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.
