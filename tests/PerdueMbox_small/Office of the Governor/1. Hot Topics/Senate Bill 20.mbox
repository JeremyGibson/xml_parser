Comment: Ron & Julia O'Bryant PO Box 18565 Greensboro, NC 27419-8565 July 7, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I am opposed to forced funding of Political campaigns. Dear Representative and Senator, Senate Bill 20 would expand forced taxpayer financing of political campaigns to the office of the state treasurer. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. Taxpayers in North Carolina can not take another burden during this economic crisis. Please vote against Senate Bill 20 and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns. Sincerely, Ron & Julia O'Bryant

Comment: Audra Hodges 3005 Broomsedge Way Durham, NC 27712-3022 July 7, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I am opposed to forced funding of Political campaigns. Dear Representative and Senator, Senate Bill 20 would expand forced taxpayer financing of political campaigns to the office of the state treasurer. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. Taxpayers in North Carolina can not take another burden during this economic crisis. Please vote against Senate Bill 20 and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns. Sincerely, Audra Hodges 919-260-6094

Subject: Vote No on Senate Bill 20

Comment: Karen DeHaan 201 Pearce Dr Jamestown, NC 27282-8443 July 7, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I am opposed to forced funding of Political campaigns. Dear Representative and Senator, Senate Bill 20 would expand forced taxpayer financing of political campaigns to the office of the state treasurer. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund campaigns they disagree with. Taxpayer financing of elections also is likely unconstitutional after the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Davis v. FEC. The legislature should not be expanding these unconstitutional programs rather the General Assembly should be repealing them. Taxpayers in North Carolina can not take another burden during this economic crisis. Please vote against Senate Bill 20 and/or any bill that expands forced taxpayer support of political campaigns. Sincerely, Karen DeHaan 336-841-7454
