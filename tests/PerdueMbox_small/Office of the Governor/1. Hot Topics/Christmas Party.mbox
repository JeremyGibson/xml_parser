Comment: You are a disgrace to the position you hold. How dare you have a holiday party for convicted felons. I have told you in the past that I thought you should pay rent to live in the gov. mansion. You belong in jail with them and ex-gov. Easley. I believe both of you are two of a kind.

Comment: What possible reason could there be for convicted felons to be attending a Christmas party at the governor's mansion? It does not matter if it has been done since 1983; it needs to stop in 2009.

Governor Perdue:

I am so angry with you for bringing convicted felons to the mansion for a party.  Are you talking from two sides of your mouth?  I so appreciated your fighting to keep in prison those sentenced to life.  STOP the politics of it all and keep violent persons in prison and STOP the party at the mansion for murderers and those who have committed heinous crimes.

I am a homicide survivor from Forsyth County.  My husband was murdered in an attempted armed robbery of our business in 1993.  I was there when his murderer was executed and have made a commitment to keep the co-defendant in prison for life.  I have been an active board member of NCVAN and serve on the NC Innocence Inquiry Commission to see that victims have a voice.

You certainly have lossed my support.  You have stabbed in the back all crime victims across this state.  We will certainly spread the word of your recent actions.  These persons are not heroes but are murderers; your insensitivity to victims is appalling.  No effort on your part or your staff can mend the contempt we now have for you.

Subject: Your Resignation

Comment: In 1987, my parents were murdered in their home. On tonight's news, I saw that you hosted a Christmas party for convicted murderers in the mansion provided for you by the tax payers of North Carolina. This is an unforgivable offense to any victim of a violent crime. You should resign from the office of Govenor immediately as you clearly lack the good judgement or common sense to lead North Carolina. If this is a traditional event as was reported on the news, then you should have made it your legacy to end this ridiculous practice. My I remind you that convicted felons have given up their right to vote, but law abiding tax payers such as myself use that right to remove idiots such as yourself from office. I will continue to work to see that you or anyone you endorse are not elected in the future. I am beyond repulsed by your actions.

To Bev Perdue,

              I just wanted to say how ashamed I am of YOU that you would invited prisoners to the Mansion that is owned by North Carolinians. I would not invite prisoners in my home and heaven forbid they get to attend a Christmas party hosted bye you. You said you was going to be tough on criminals and It sure does not look like it. We have 2 life in prison couple about to get out for good behavior.What are you thinking. I can not sit quitley an let this be done. I need my voice heard. I am sure if you was just a normal person no politics involved you would not let prisoners in your home murderers at that. Can you relly tell me what you was thinking? What do you excpet to get out of this? publicity or humilaition which you have accomplished. I did not vote for you and I am so Blessed that I didn't. I can not wait till you are out of office. I hope to hear from  you Bev Perdue or some one just so I know 100% WHY have a party an invite the prisoners. Good behavior is not a excuss either. We have other people who could have used that money but it was wasted wasted on a party regardless of where the money came from. We have major needs in our state as it is. I am sure a family unemployed could of have an extra meal on the table with that money you through away. I may be reached at 336 573 2787. Recbecca Lemons 196 Duck Road Stoneville NC 27048.

Comment: Shame on YOU, The people that are responsible for inviting Felons to the Governors Holiday Party! Did you ever think of inviting Military families, College student who have great grades and are struggling to finance their education? How about the Military Families who lost their Mother, Father, Son ,Daughter, Husband or Wife in combat? Please don't reply well this has been going on for years! Step up to the plate and take responsibility and stop this crazy unamerican, stupid tradition. I can't imagine how families of the victims feel that the person who caused their pain was invited to the Governors Holiday Party. Shame, Shame on you!! Its obvious you can't step up to the plate, because you can't even call it a Christmas Party. This is sooooooooooo wrong and an injustice to the people of NC. Does next years invitation include Osoma Bin Laden? So ashamed of this event as a Citizen of NC and the USA. Sincerely from the bottom of my heart, Jan Sherrell 336-996-0872

Mrs. Perdue -- what part of dumb political moves do you not understand?? When one minute you are against letting killers out of jail- but yet you have a party for others. I bet you yourself will not respond to this email- I've been on the other side of the law when I was young and stupid. Now I reckon I'm older and dumber but, your tactics are about as stupid as they come. And it just proves to me that my thoughts about our leaders are true- We have the three stooges running the country and idiot for a Governor. We have people without jobs, loosing their homes, unable to pay bills. When is enough enough?? Our government bails out big business and let small business struggle. It's the small business that make this country, cause when you tax large business enough they run to another country. A prime example of large business being stupid - American tire companies- Our government imposes a tariff tax on tires coming from China to boost American tire sales- the large American tire companies in turn increase their prices to the distributors- Classic sign of greed. The small business is the one that really suffers. By the way what is your definition on small business- how big do you have to be to be a small business, my company employ's 5 people, could hire more, if people had jobs so they could afford to by parts or have their cars repaired.

Comment: Dear Governor, I'm really disappointed that you had a dinner at the Governor's Mansion for convicted felons & murders...... You are giving the people of NC mixed reviews on crime.... We voted you in to do alot of hard core recruiting for new jobs, tax cuts. Not to feed these criminals at the mansion a fancy meal.... I visited the Mansion with my son & daughters 4th grade and we could only view certain sections of the mansion, & you have these criminals working there with FREE reins of the place..... WHATS UP with that...... I'm fuming with this....... You promise all this stuff and produce NOTHING....... Just the day before the dinner you are on TV talking about criminal being released and living beside of you, then the next day have a NICE DINNER for them. You are giving MIXED reviews...... PLEASE EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE OF NC.................. CONCERNED CITIZEN, MISTY HARDISTER

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am just curious as to why you would spend money hosting a party for convicted felons. Did it ever occur to you to host a dinner for the policemen and women who sacrifice daily to protect the citizens of NC? Or the firemen and women? What about the teachers of NC? I am a teacher in NC and I am absolutely disgusted with this "tradition". You might need to consider your decisions more wisely. I can tell you that I would never even consider voting for you you and will forward on my letter to everyone I know. Stephanie Goodwin

Subject: You did the right thing!!!!

Comment: I believe the people that are wrong to say the things about you that I have heard because you are giving deserving, Rehabilitated, people a second chance. They deserved to go to the employee party as much as any other employee. Prisoners have to work hard to get work release, much less at the Governor's mansion. Those inmates have proven that they are trying to be productive citizens. Who did it hurt for them be included just like any other employee. Were you supposed to say..."We are having our Holiday party for employees next week, everyone is invited, except for you, you, you, and you......etc. Someone said that you are not as hard on crime as you said you were. How do they get that? You did not go on the street, find killers, child molesters, rapist and say lets go party!!! Bottom line is this...YOU DID THE RIGHT THING..THANK YOU!

20301 Mail Service Center • Raleigh, NC 27699-0301





UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudill’s ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rand’s decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudill’s decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Court’s decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

Well, great.  Now if only Bev had the good sense to not have a group of murderers partying at the Governor's mansion.  Just because "tax" money wasn't used for the party doesn't mean that it wasn't the "taxpayer's" money that was used.  The mansion belongs to the people of the State.  Revenue from its rental belongs to those who own the mansion and to have money spent on a bunch of murderers is outrageous.  I don't care how long it has been done in the past.  Now that it is out in the open Gov. Perdue ought to put and end to it!

Yes, it is amazing how people look out for the inmates. I wished someone would look out for the Correctional Officers. We have a very important and dangerous job. They get a party. We get nothing. No Party and no raise.

Thanks and admire our governor for this stand. But VERY disappointed in her for the party she gave and the guest attending. She stated it was a tradition but I for one citizen have never known this was taking place. 100% disagree with this event taking place with any governor. Time for our leaders to stand and break some of these traditions going on.

Again & as ususal, Perdue is full of crap!!!
 Why don't you treat the people of this state with the same consideration & respect you show the murderer's wondering around the gov. mansion being treated like hero's?
 I don't see any of the "REAL AMERICAN HERO"S" hanging around there being invited to "CHRISTMAS"parties, and yes I hope that the word "CHRISTMAS" is offensive to you, gives me all the reason more to use it frequently!!!
 These e-mails are never read I am sure, so therefor, anyone can say whatever they like !!!
 By the way, when are the people that these murderer's killed going to be pardoned and sent back to be with their families ???
 That's  what I thought, NEVER, so lets just keep right on giving these sorry low life convics the leasurely lives they have worked so hard to deserve and lets just forget how they took away the rights of the dead forever
 I guess in the world you politicians live in, 5 or 10 years is plenty of time to give up of your life for taking someone elses life for ever. By the way, "FOREVER" is a very long time huh ?
 Cant wait for the next election year, how about you ?

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mrs. Martha Neese

Address: 102 Brewster Cir, Hendersonville, NC 28791

Email: martha.neese@yahoo.com

Subject: Your holiday party for prisoners

Comment: Martha Neese 102 Brewster Circle Hendersonville, NC 28791-1331 December 20, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: 20 December 2009 I saw the article stating that you hosted convicted killers and other prisoners Tuesday night at a holiday party at the Governor's Mansion. According to the article seventeen inmates who work at the mansion were invited to the party. One of them was Reginald Patterson who's serving life in prison for murder. Nine other convicted killers and four armed robbers were also in attendance. Many corporate and government holiday parties, including the Department of Correction's party, have been canceled because of the recession, and yet you hosted this party. I would like to ask you the following question: Why, exactly, are convicted killers and other prisoners, many who are serving "life sentences," allowed to have "work release" and work at the mansion, when North Carolina has so many citizens who are unemployed and needing a job? It does not matter to me that taxpayer money was not used for the party. If someone is supposed to be serving a "life sentence" then they should not be allowed to be on any work release program. What part of "life sentence" do you not understand? I know that there are many unemployed citizens of NC who would love to have the chance to have those jobs that you give to convicted killers and other prisoners. I do not think that you are concerned about the citizens of the state that elected you, and I do not think that you will have the chance for another term. I would like a real response from you to my letter, not just one of your "form letters" that your staff sends out. Do you even read the mail that you get from people who live in NC? I also do not understand the reason for maintaining the Western NC Governor's Mansion since it is just a drain on the state budget and serves no purpose that I can think of, especially since we have better roads and very nice hotels, unlike when the Western Mansion was built. My husband and I were both born and raised in NC and chose to return here when he retired from the Air Force after 24 years. We love this state, but we are not happy to see the way it is being run. I await a response from you, either by Email or by regular mail. Sincerely, Martha Neese 828-692-5245 Martha Neese sent this message via Congress.org, which uses the Capwizï¿½XC system.

	I don't see how justice is being served here.  How can the leaders of this state and country be so contradictory? Why are there different sets of rules for different sets of people?  How can any one person say that one person can be reformed and another cannot?  Gov Perdue, with all due respect, I honestly cannot understand how you can let 19 prisoners (murderers and the likes) work in the Governor's mansion and then stand up and say that prisoners who have committed murder should not be released from prison?  Please tell me what the difference is?  And WHY did the murderers working in the mansion not get life or death sentences?  Who did they murder or rob or attempt to murder?  Does that make a difference? When is murder NOT murder?  I really do want answers to these questions.  You cannot call the sky blue just because you want a sunny day one minute and then call it gray when you decide you want rain.  If I am going to be sent email like this one, then I want to be able to voice my opinion.  This is out and out injustice as far as I am concerned.  And NO I do not know any of these people, but I do know that it just doesn't seem right to me.  And I am not alone in this way of thinking.  I really do want an answer to these questions.
