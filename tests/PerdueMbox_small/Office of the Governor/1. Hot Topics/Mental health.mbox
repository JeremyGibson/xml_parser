Subject: Mental Health Service Reduction

Comment: I am writing in regards to the drastic cuts to the Mental Health System during this fiscal year. As all citizens of NC are aware, we are having budgetary issues at this time. However, I do feel that there are other areas which could have been reduced rather than in the mental health system. As a Qualified Mental Health Professional of approximately eight years, I can testify to the fact that these consumers do in fact need services to assist with stabilization. Many consumers are not able to adequately coordinate their own services and rely on professionals to assist with coordination of services and benefits that fit their particular needs. Since the fiscal year's budget was signed, I have seen several consumers decompensate, due to the reduction in their services, to the point that they have required hospitalization in a psychiatric unit. My opinion is that these hospitalizations (which cost the state more than if the consumer could have continued at their current service)could have been avoided if the consumer were allowed to continue in their services. The mentally ill individuals in our state need and deserve our assistance. I urge you to reconsider these drastic changes to service arrays across the state.

Subject: Loss of services and supports for people with developmental disabilities, addictive disease and mental illness

Comment: As a Director on both the ARC of Gastonia and Gaston Residential Services boards, we have watched developments in the State budget process which have placed our population in grave jeopardy. At risk is the ability to adequately provide care for citizens of this fair state which have moderate to severe disabilities. The below letter was drafted by our Board Chairman and is reproduced for you review. As you will read, in October, 2008 the Pathways LME reduced the state IPRS funds of its providers. All other local IPRS providers had their funding reinstated shortly thereafter, but due to a Pathways oversight our funding was not reinstated. For 2008-2009, GRS had approximately $230,000 of unreimbursed services. All of the services were authorized as medically necessary, justifiable services. AN OVERSIGHT BY PATHWAYS MAY CAUSE GRS TO NO LONGER BE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. At this week’s GRS board meeting the board learned that our IPRS funding was cut an additional 6% by Pathways LME. This is an 18% cut within two years that we have had to contend with, more than any other service provider in our field. We cannot operate with an 18% reduction in funds without cutting services to the people. Special and unusual problems require special considerations. This is one of those times! We simply ask that this message get to the appropriate elected officials. It would seem that one less pot hole be fixed or one less right of way cutting be performed so to continue service to our adults with developmental disabilities. Please read the following letter in its entirety and give measured thought to the problems now faced by those we support. Respectfully, Jim Hoyle October 9, 2009 Dear ___________: I am the Board Chairperson of a community based non-profit organization in Gaston County, North Carolina, Gaston Residential Services (GRS). Currently we touch the lives of approximately 200 families in our community with our programs and we have a staff of 175 full and part time people. In addition to assisting people in supported employment and assisting the homeless to find housing, our original and primary endeavor has been our residential program serving adults with developmental disabilities. Since 1975 this award winning program has served individuals with disabilities in the most inclusive natural settings near family and friends. Originally, the North Carolina legislature allocated funds for each of the homes and in fact we brought many people back to their communities from the state institution, the Riddle Center (formerly, Western Carolina Center). Now, funding issues are threatening these services we have been providing for almost 35 years. First, in October, 2008 the Pathways LME reduced the state IPRS funds of its providers. All other local IPRS providers had their funding reinstated shortly thereafter, but due to a Pathways oversight our funding was not reinstated. For 2008-2009, GRS had approximately $230,000 of unreimbursed services. All of the services were authorized as medically necessary, justifiable services. AN OVERSIGHT BY PATHWAYS MAY CAUSE GRS TO NO LONGER BE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. At this week’s GRS board meeting the board learned that our IPRS funding was cut an additional 6% by Pathways LME. This is an 18% cut within two years that we have had to contend with, more than any other service provider in our field. We cannot operate with an 18% reduction in funds without cutting services to the people. Secondly, the NC Legislature in its heroic efforts to deal with the state budget crisis made the determination that persons receiving Medicaid CAP/MR services could not supplement these services with state IPRS funding. In fact, in most cases we have found that this is a very fair ruling. Certain general exceptions were granted to this rule, but some of the people served by GRS who require both funding sources are not included in the general exceptions. One of the programs threatened by these decreases is our five year old Shelter plus Care Program for adults with developmental disabilities. This program utilizes HUD money to pay the rent for twelve individuals in housing of their choosing. Most people have chosen to live alone in apartment complexes in our city. GRS matches the amount of rent with services provided. We have provided these services with a combination of Medicaid and IPRS money. This program received commendations from our national accrediting organization. Unless an exception for these people is made, we will be unable to continue this program. In addition, GRS has been successfully serving two men with severe medical and behavioral challenges for ten years. They live together in a home in a neighborhood in Gastonia and receive intense supervision. Their lives are the most stable ever and they began part time supported work this year. For the past five years we have been authorized to bill Medicaid CAP/MR and state IPRS for these services because the state and Pathways recognized the intense level of care these two gentlemen required. Reducing staff for these two men will compromise their health and safety and we will be forced to close this program. We desperately need two things. First, that the people mentioned above be included as exceptions to the legislative mandate and deemed eligible to receive both CAP/MR and state IPRS funds for their support. Secondly, that the state allocates to Pathways LME an additional $230,000 in IPRS funding designated for services at GRS. At an average cost of $16,400 annually, fourteen people will be allowed to continue the lives they have built in our community! We truly realize with the budget constraints we all are facing we must all tighten our belts, and we have done that, however, the people we serve and represent cannot help themselves, they depend totally on you and I to help them. In addition, GRS provides services at a much lower cost than many state agencies. The quality of life of the people we serve is in your hands. We respectfully request you re-consider funds to our organization. Our board members serve pro-bono with zero funds for mileage or personal expenses. Our board members serve out of respect for those who cannot help themselves. I appreciate all the hard work you are doing in Raleigh and thank you for your time and consideration to this most important issue. You may contact me personally at 704-922-9800 cell: 704-813-1839, or Rita Thuot at Gaston Residential Services at 704-861-9280 for additional information. Respectfully, J. Dean Carpenter Board Chair

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency.

Subject: competitive bidding problems

Comment: Glenn Huggins 5519 crosshill court charlotte, NC 28277-0553 October 15, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As an (owner/employee) of a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier in (state)/(your district), I want to share with you my deep concerns about the recently passed Medicare prescription drug bill that includes reimbursement reductions on high volume DME items and future competitive bidding provisions. The bill reduces reimbursement for home medical equipment by more than ten billion over the next ten years. It is unrealistic for elected officials to believe that reducing reimbursements by that amount will not have a significant negative impact on the quality of equipment and service Medicare patients will receive. Further, the so-called "competitive bidding" provisions of the bill run opposite the principles espoused by the bills supporters. "Competitive bidding" as construed by this bill, actually restricts competition by allowing a massive governmental bureaucracy (CMS) to make decisions on which companies can and cannot provide home medical equipment and services to our seniors. Rather than open the market, these provisions move the question of provider choice from the beneficiary to the government. The result is a dramatic reduction in choice, lower quality equipment and service, halting of new research monies into the market and elimination of thousands of small businesses. This government controlled system has been tried in several foreign countries and has not worked. Further, history has shown that the federal government is not adept at purchasing decisions, as evidenced by numerous well-publicized problems with defense procurement over the years. In 2002, Small Business Committee Chairman Manzullo recognized the serious threat competitive bidding poses and wrote to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas warning that competitive bidding for home health DME "does not bode well for the ability of small business to continue to participate in the Medicare program." I hope you agree that there is too much at stake to gamble on an unproven bidding provision that will undoubtedly eliminate thousands of small business jobs in our state and harm the elderly and disabled home health patients we serve. Please urge the leadership to consider any amendments to the bill (or any future legislation) that would remove these harmful provisions. My (employees/family) and I are counting on your support. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Glenn Huggins 7048148740

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system.

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated.

This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT.

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES.

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency. Truly, Health Freedom is our First Freedom, or, as Thomas Jefferson wrote: ?Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.? Media Release: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=3617

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency. Truly, Health Freedom is our First Freedom, or, as Thomas Jefferson wrote: ?Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.? Media Release: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=3617

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency.

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates.

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless.

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Subject: Canadian article about Sludge--bio-solids

Comment: Given the growing concern for sludge (bio-solids_ treated sewage) being spread on land and the house bill seeking to sanction putting it into the NC groundwaters, here is an article from Quebec for your information. Donna Bonds 205 Emerywood Court Kernersville, NC 27284 36-993-5782 Block that sludge! Tiny Elgin, QC sets legal precedent in blocking use of municipal sludge on its territory. Dateline: Monday, October 12, 2009 by Holly Dressel In November of 2006, the tiny municipality of Elgin, Quebec, comprised of only a few hundred people, passed a by-law prohibiting the spreading, storage or transport of municipal or de-inking sludge on its territory. The people living in Elgin, about 60 km southwest of Montreal, understood that Canada's water treatment systems are not able to remove many toxic elements intrinsic to sludge, such as: pathogens like H1N1 or E. coli; dangerous chemicals like flame retardants; medications; hormones; or, the heavy metals that get into sewage systems from small industries and the de-inking process of paper recycling mills. Farmers in the area were particularly worried about the heavy metals in de-inking sludges, which can sterilize soils, rendering the soil useless and in fact dangerous for crop production in a relatively short period of time. Such material can be trucked in from distant, large cities and cannot be traced. Elgin's by-law was passed in order to "protect public health and the environment." "...Lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation." The local farm wishing to spread the sludge took the village to court, on the grounds that the process is not only legal in Quebec and across Canada but encouraged by provincial regulations. They were backed by a huge multinational waste management company, GSI, which makes its money by taking human and de-inking sludge off the hands of overwhelmed municipalities, calling it a crop fertilizer, and selling it to farmers at much cheaper rates than regular chemical fertilizers. On October 1, 2009, to the surprise of many, Quebec's Superior court upheld the town's bylaw. Judge Steve J. Reimnitz invoked the well-known Supreme Court ruling in the case of Hudson, Quebec's similar ban on cosmetic pesticides. In his 38-page decision, Judge Reimnitz also invoked the Precautionary Principle: "Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation." This is more support for the principle emphasized in the Hudson case, which obliges municipalities to be "proactive in the areas of human health and the environment." Every municipality today is coping with the daily rivers of human and industrial wastes removed by water treatment plants. Back in the 1970s, public opinion and health officials finally convinced all levels of government that raw sewage could no longer be dumped into rivers, lakes and oceans without destroying drinking water. Environmental reasons also were a driving factor in paper recycling. Arsenic, lead and other heavy metals in the inks are removed in the recycling process and are concentrated in the sludge. At first this material was put in landfills or taken by tanker for deep-sea disposal, but in 1992 it was discovered that these sludges were so toxic they were causing enormous dead zones along ocean coasts and were declared too poisonous to dump at sea. However, they were backing up in landfills and other storage facilities on land. Sludge can be slowly composted, although getting rid of the heavy metals can be difficult. Instead, sludge can be put through a "constructed wetland" or incinerated in closed-system plasma incinerators that leave very little residue. The practice of spreading sludge on farmlands developed in the early 1990s. Then, the American EPA provided the cheapest solutions when it renamed sludge "biosolids" [MRF or Materieles Residuelles Fertilisantes, "Residual Fertilizing Materials" in French] and declared it a valuable fertilizer, suitable for spreading on crop and pastureland. Canada's Food Inspection Agency followed the EPA action quickly. A predictable number of contamination cases followed, including some human deaths from pathogens and the loss of dairy herds that had been sickened by poisoned pastures. More than a third of sludge spread on fields, researchers found, is not taken up by soils or plants but washes into the surface water, percolates into the ground water, and ends up in rivers and oceans anyway. The anti-sludge movement that has grown up in Quebec and other provinces has turned to scientific research like that provided by the Cornell Waste Management Institute in Ithaca, New York. One part of the Cornell assessment states that "The sheer number of dangers associated with treating sludge as if it were a fertilizer is so great, so various and so serious that it would be the life work of thousands of professionals to divide up and respond to the categories of problems that will arise from this practice." The recent Elgin ruling forces large municipalities to deal with their own wastes, rather than dumping them out of sight on cropland far away. It also encourages rural municipalities to protect their territories and their citizens from harm. Elgin mayor Jean-Pierre Proulx says, "We've been given the right to say 'No!'" Will Amos, a staff lawyer with the NGO Ecojustice, involved in the Hudson case, says, "Towns across Quebec and Canada are heeding our highest court's message. They should be encouraged to take action." Holly Dressel, author and researcher, is one of Canada’s most recognized writers on environmental, health care, economic and aboriginal issues. Dressel is best known for her many collaborations with television host Dr. David Suzuki on film and radio programs. They have co-authored three books together, From Naked Ape to Super-species Good News for a Change and More Good News, which is coming out in the spring of 2010. Dressel is also the author of a forthcoming major history and analysis of Canadian health care, . Email: theatoole@yahoo.com.

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency. Truly, Health Freedom is our First Freedom, or, as Thomas Jefferson wrote: ?Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.? Media Release: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=3617

Subject: Mental Health Funding Cuts

Comment: I work in an apartment community in Asheville. Yesterday one of the residents came in to let us know her mental health services were going to be suspended due to budget cuts. She received free or discounted care twice a week. I think it has been shown in the past the cutting mental health funding doesn't work. Those recipients will just show up later at emergency rooms, jails or state hospitals. Are there no other options to balance the budget?

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave.

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free man/woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency. Truly, Health Freedom is our First Freedom, or, as Thomas Jefferson wrote: ?Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.? Media Release: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=3617

Subject: Prevent Pharma Serfdom

Comment: Mandatory Vaccination, or "Voluntary" Vaccination, Refusal of Which is Punished, is Pharma Slavery, Outlawed by the Thirteenth Amendment, Federal, State and Common Law "Voluntary" pandemic vaccinations which are, in fact, actually mandatory are likely consequences of the dangerous misinformation propagating the scientifically invalid "Pandemic Emergency" and apparent, but inaccurate, "urgent need" for vaccination with unsafe, untested, unnecessary and uninsurable vaccines which were hastily approved without a single scientific test to determine even basic safety information. A Pandemic Health Emergency was declared by the United States 11 days after the first death due to Swine Flu in Mexico City. Accurate case, morbidity and mortality statistics do not exist since WHO and CDC suggested that counts be stopped since there are no tests which are accurate to more than 10%! ALL morbidity and mortality data are literally no more than guesses. As a free man or woman, it is my basic right to make my own choices about my own health path. Dangerous vaccinations and discredited drugs may be the lot of Pharma Serfs, bound to involuntary servitude to the largest economic force on the planet, but you and I are protected by the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the entire body of Common Law, from being forced into slavery and punished if we choose to control our our physical fates. There is good reason to believe that these vaccines, admixed with untested, unlicensed and dangerous adjuvants can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterility, to those who receive them. The Natural Solutions Foundation is currently suing the US Government in Federal Court to prevent the release of these dangerous and untested drugs on an emergency basis. Patents secured for vaccines like those now being readied for mass distribution detail how strong adjuvants and components of the human or animal body combine to create permanent, irreversible sterility. Good evidence exists to suggest that this technology is part of the new, untested vaccines. Please see http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3619 for the full text of the Complaint and http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?page_id=3624 for the full text of the Brief in this matter. Forced sterilization of children, pregnant women and fertile adults is, surely, a form of Pharma Serfdom that no free man or woman can accept. There is no pandemic disease which threatens our health. There are only pandemic vaccines which do so. The Natural Solutions Foundation, www.HealthFreedomUSA.org, urges us all, legislator and voter, to take the concept of health freedom urgently seriously. After all, control of our own bodies, and those of our children, is, in fact, our first and most pivotal freedom. The draft legislation appended to the end of this letter holds, in fact, the core of that freedom and I urge you to introduce it and garner legislative and constituent support for it on an emergency basis. Conventional hearings and findings of fact will, in fact, come too late if the vaccines being forced upon us turn out to be as deadly as clear-eyed scientific inquiry shows them to be. We need your action now. I, as free woman under the laws of these United States, demand the right to make my own health decisions, demand the right to shelter in my home rather than face any type of punishment or incarceration should I refuse to submit to vaccines or other treatments which I believe to be detrimental to my well being or contrary to my belief system. I am willing to accept for myself and my children the risks and benefits of either taking or refraining from taking any vaccine or treatment. That choice lies solely in my own hands based on my own wishes. The risks of the pandemic vaccines are, in fact, unknown since no safety or risk assessment has been carried out on these vaccines, making all informed consent meaningless. Any contravention of this freedom to chart my own health course is a violation of my inalienable rights under the United States Constitution and the Constitutiion of this State. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to join me and millions of others in preserving our most basis freedom: control of our bodies. Please bring the attached draft legislation forward as you own initiative and enlist the support of your fellow legislators. I can promise you that institutions like the Natural Solutions Foundation, at whose suggestion I am contacting you, will take the lead in vigorously supporting your pro-freedom, anti-slavery actions. Thank you for your time and careful attention to this urgent matter. Here is the draft of the legislation which restores our health freedom in the face of dangerous "Voluntary" vaccinations which can be refused only at the price of fines and incarcerations/quarantines[changes for State level legislation in [brackets] since State action is essential for protection]: ---------------------------- H.R. ________: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding 111th CONGRESS [State Legislature] FEDERAL: To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [STATE: To amend the Emergency Medical Powers Act or any similar legislation] (Co-Sponsors) ______ A BILL To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004 concerning the use of Federal funds, self-quarantine and self-shielding, and for other purposes. [the Health Codes and State Emergency medical Powers Acts or any similar legislation] Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled [by the Senate and House of Representatives of this State in legislative session assembled], SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ?Protecting Self-Shielding Act? SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 1. A ?declaration of pandemic emergency? under this Act shall include any declaration of pandemic or similar medical emergency by any International, National, Regional, State or Local authorities, including a ?Level 6? pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. 2. ?Self-quarantine? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, after exposure to a pathogen. 3. ?Self-shielding? is when an individual, group or family chooses to temporarily remain at home or other voluntarily chosen location, to avoid exposure to a pathogen. SEC. 3. FINDINGS REGARDING SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). The Congress of the United States [State legislature] has determined: 1. The common law practice of voluntarily self-quarantining or self-shielding in the event of a declaration of pandemic emergency is the preferred public health response to such pandemic. 2. The right of the people to self-quarantine or self-shield should not be abridged by any governmental authority. 3. Self-quarantine or self-shield is a reasonable alternative to mandatory inoculations with uninsurable vaccinations. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR SELF-QUARANTINE (SELF-SHIELDING). In the event of any declaration of pandemic emergency, nothing in Federal [State] law or regulation shall be interpreted by any agency of the United States, [State of ___] or any Court thereof, to forbid self-shielding or self-quarantine at home, nor shall any Federal [State] funds, or materials, supplies, and support materials purchased with Federal [state] funds be expended to remove any person involuntarily from his or her home, place of residence, school, work or other location in order to prevent or interfere with self-shielding or self-quarantine. The Armed Forces of the United States [police and peace officers of the State], their agents or any agent of the US Government, Department of Homeland Security, any Department of Public Health, State or local authorities, shall not remove any person involuntarily from his or her home or other location voluntarily chosen for self-shielding or self-quarantine while such person is self-shielding or under self-quarantine. ---------------------------------- There is no public policy issue more important than protecting the civil rights of Americans during a declared pandemic emergency. Truly, Health Freedom is our First Freedom, or, as Thomas Jefferson wrote: ?Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.? Media Release: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=3617

Subject: Protecting Vaccine Exemptions

Comment: Swine Flu Vaccines: Novel Dangers Require Novel Protection To the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of the United States Government, including the President, My National Legislators, the District Court as hereinafter noted and the following Executive Agencies: Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Adminstration and the Centers for Disease Control: I believe that all vaccine exemptions traditionally allowed under law and regulation must be permitted and encouraged as essential public health policy. These include: (1) Exemptions for Reasons of Health (all allergies, asthma, learning disorders, immune system disorders and previous vaccine reactions, even if not reported at the time, must be considered contraindications); (2) Exemptions of Conscience and (3) Exemptions of Religious Belief. United States Citizens and residents must have the right to alternatives to the uninsurable risk posed by vaccinations. PANDEMIC VACCINE MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR AGENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEAR TOTAL IMMUNITY FROM ANY LIABILITY POSED BY THESE VACCINES, YET COMPULSIONS AND MANDATES HAVE ERODED NECESSARY OPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO ACCEPTING THESE VACCINES. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issues recommendations for vaccine use and exemptions. Those recommendations, while not having the formal force of law in and of themselves, are used by legislative and regulatory bodies to create State, local, employment, educational and other policies which can become binding. For example, on August 23, 2009, New York State's Commissioner of Publc Health Daines created a mandatory "emergency" regulation for all health care workers in the State forcing them to either follow the ACIP's recommendations or lose their employment, school status, and other rights and opportunities. While most states allow for exemptions on medical, religious and personal conviction grounds, so-called "pandemic" vaccination exemptions are virtually non existant. In a context in which the FDA, parent body to BOTH the CDC and ACIP, is currently being sued (Null, Laibow et al v FDA et al., DC US District Court Docket 01:2009-0926) for emergency relief to prevent the deployment of pandemic vaccines which have never been safety tested and may pose enormous dangers both in the near and long term, for a trivial disease whose real incidence is totally unknown but which poses no meaningful threat, such deployment is unconsionable. I am writing to you at the suggestion of Natural Solutions Foundation in your official capacity to petition you to bring to an abrupt halt the deployment of these dangerous vaccines, which either alone or admixed with untested, unapproved adjuvants (as is the FDA's announced contingency plan) pose far more of a threat of infertility, adverse events and death than the mild and unimpressive Swine Flu ever has and TO URGE YOU IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT CONSCIENTIOUS, RELIGIOUS, MEDICAL AND OTHER EXEMPTIONS TO BOTH PANDEMIC AND NON-PANDEMIC VACCINES. Current law and regulation makes vaccine refusal either a misdemeanor or a felony in virtually every state. This "crime" is punishable by involuntary quarantine and/or forcible vaccination at the discretion and whim of the State. Federal law and regulation allows vaccine refusers to also be involuntarily indefinitely quarantined and/or forcibly treated. Children can be forcibly treated against their parents' wishes, just as their parents and other adults can be forcibly treated against their own wishes, along with every other adult, adolescent, child and baby in the country. This coercive medical fascism fundamentally violates the Constitution of these United States, including the 13th Amendment which forbids both slavery and indentured servitude since forcible use of one's body is, in fact, nothing short of a state of servitued and illegal use by a master whose decisions override those of the subordinate/slave. I urge you to use the power vested in you to halt this forcible utilization of arbitrary and capricious authority to disseminate dangerous and, because the laws and regulations governing the release and approval of drugs has been drastically ignored, illegal vaccines under the unwarented guise of a "pandemic" whose very EXISTENCE AS A HEALTH THREAT is STRONGLY CHALLENGED BY MANY EXPERTS AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AGREEMENT. Yours in health and freedom,
