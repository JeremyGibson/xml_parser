Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

New York is leading the way with its Healthy Workplace Bill. The
State Assembly just passed two study bills that will authorize
and direct the department of labor to study hostile workplace
behavior and its consequences.

I fully support bills such as these and encourage you to enact
legislation in our state that will protect employees from
bullying in the workplace.


Sincerely,

There should, in my opinion, be no tolerance for workplace
bullying. The person being bullied is there to work, not to be
abused. Once exposed, the bully should be out looking for
another job, immediately, if not sooner.

I am presently bullied at work myself. The person who does it
does not do it in front of anyone else, just when she and I are
together. It has affected my health and my confidence. She keeps
me so upset that I am now looking for another job after 14
years. This needs to stop and if the person won't stop then give
someone else the job.

As a victim of workplace bullying myself, I cannot stress how
important this legislation would be. I am imprisoned in an
emotionally abusive work situation and have been unable to find
another job in my industry due to the poor economy. In the past
18 months I have suffered from severe depression caused by
constant verbal abuse from my supervisors. At present I have no
recourse against any of their abuses. I urge you, please join me
in supporting legislation that will protect employees like me
from workplace bullying.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

New York is leading the way with its Healthy Workplace Bill. The
State Assembly just passed two study bills that will authorize
and direct the department of labor to study hostile workplace
behavior and its consequences.

I fully support bills such as these and encourage you to enact
legislation in our state that will protect employees from
bullying in the workplace.


Sincerely,

While working for my last employer, they had persistantly
accused me of things such as smoking in the bathroom and not
doing paperwork properly. They done this while they were aware
that I suffer from emotional problems such as depression and
bipolar disorder. I honestly feel that they done this to legally
get rid of me.

Our friend's son just lost his job as the result of what appears
to be the jealousy of the boss over the compliments this young

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

New York is leading the way with its Healthy Workplace Bill. The
State Assembly just passed two study bills that will authorize
and direct the department of labor to study hostile workplace
behavior and its consequences.

I fully support bills such as these and encourage you to enact
legislation in our state that will protect employees from
bullying in the workplace.

Especially when its your boss that is the bully. makes work very
stressful. please do something to protect the people that are
working hard and doing a good job. thanks.

North Carolina does nothing to help employees to have a
harassment-free work environment from both co-workers,
supervisors and managers. An employee lives in fear of being
fired or retaliated against for speaking up because North
Carolina is a fire-at-will state. No one should have to be
subjected to verbal abuse, harassment, or ridicule in the work
place. It is not only psychological abuse, but immoral behavior
on the part of those who are allowed to get away with it.
Currently, one of my sisters is in such a position. The way she
has been treated has been horrible. The things she has had to
endure and must continue to endure are inexcusable. She has been
humiliated, sabotaged, intimidated and treated reprehensibly and
she has no way of relief - at least not from the state of North
Carolina. She needs her job and cannot quit. North Carolina
needs to enact a bill to stop harassment in the workplace and
enact legislation that will protect employees from hostile acts
in the workplace.

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I'm writing to voice my concern over the Legislature's recent $2.3 million cut to the Special Assistance appropriation, which helps pay for care for residents in North Carolina's 1,400 assisted-living facilities.

While you can't undo the Legislature's cuts, you have it in your power to stand up and help more than 25,000 elderly North Carolinians whose lives will be negatively impacted by the Legislature's actions.

You can help by asking the federal Medicaid program to pay for the full range of health support services that adult care homes provide for residents, including:

Monitoring and supervising residents' health and mental health on a 24-hour basis

Managing their medications

Making sure they are eating right and getting the nutrition they need.

That will mean more federal Medicaid dollars for assisted-living residents in North Carolina. It will enable adult care homes to provide quality care. And it will mean better health care services for more than 25,000 of our state's most vulnerable citizens.

Medicaid is paying for those services today in many other states - and in nursing homes and home care right here in North Carolina. Why shouldn't Medicaid pay for the same services in adult care homes?

Please take action today to ensure that North Carolina's assisted-living residents get the care they need.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Fifty-four million Americans report being bullied at work --
that's 37 percent of the workforce.

Workplace bullying is a public epidemic that is easily
overlooked. It can include verbal abuse, offensive behaviors
that are intimidating or humiliating, and sabotage that
interferes with work.

The recession makes it harder to find a new job when bullying
gets out of hand. And working with a bully in the office can be
very taxing. Bullying is a form of psychological violence that
can cause stress, depression and even suicide.

New York is leading the way with its Healthy Workplace Bill. The
State Assembly just passed two study bills that will authorize
and direct the department of labor to study hostile workplace
behavior and its consequences.

I fully support bills such as these and encourage you to enact
legislation in our state that will protect employees from
bullying in the workplace.


Sincerely,
