Dear Governor Perdue,

I urge you to step in and fight the Senate's budget proposal,
which would destroy "More at Four," one of the country's most
highly rated pre-kindergarten programs. Especially given this
economic downturn, all families need access to high-quality
pre-k, and North Carolina needs to invest in building its human
capital -- starting with its youngest citizens.

Children and families urgently need you to speak out against the
Senate proposal, expected to pass today by a wide margin, which
would negatively impact nearly 30,000 children served by More at
Four. North Carolina voters and the nation, having heard your
support of high-quality pre-k in your State of the State
address, are watching.

North Carolina has been a national leader on early education,
and "More at Four" is one of only two state pre-k programs in
the country that meet all 10 quality benchmarks established by
the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER).
Please ensure that pre-k in North Carolina does not regress
under your watch and remains a fiscal priority in our state.

Sincerely,


Karen Clark
