Governor Perdue

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has arbitrarily decided to subject 79 pending permits for coal mining operations in Appalachia to an "enhanced review" process.  The criteria and schedule for this so-called "enhanced" process have not been available to the public or to the mining applications.

EPA's action, or inaction, is threatening more than 100,000 jobs and further destabilizes communities that have been battered by the recession.  Moreover, millions of Americans depend on coal for affordable electricity, and the Appalachian states depend on coal for tax revenue that keeps their budgets afloat.

When nationwide unemployment is at its highest level in years, the government should not stop Americans from going to work.  When states are facing major budget shortfalls and even bankruptcy because of the weak economy, the federal government should not kill important sources of state revenue.

The consequences of the EPA's actions will be severe.  Please take action today to pressure the EPA to lift these bureaucratic roadblocks.  The future of families across Appalachia depends on you.

Governor Perdue

Coal Mining is an important industry for America.  It produces abundant and inexpensive energy for all the citizens of our nation and it's efficiency and positive impact on the environment is improving every day.  The current administration appears to have the coal industry in it's sights for the next business to be destroyed by this increasingly restrictive administration.  Have you ever researched how many jobs will be affected with these new restrictions?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has arbitrarily decided to subject 79 pending permits for coal mining operations in Appalachia to an "enhanced review" process.  The criteria and schedule for this so-called "enhanced" process have not been available to the public or to the mining applications.

You need to protect our industries industries instead of wiping them out.  You need to make inexpensive energy available instead of forever raising the cost of living in the USA.

It's official:  we are under attack by our own government.

On October 15, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told lawmakers she has no intention of killing coal mining.  On October 16, she rescinded a legal mining permit that was issued in 2007.  This permit - the Spruce Number 1 Mine permit - was one of the most reviewed and scrutinized permits in history.  It took 10 years to be approved.  

Now the federal government says:  "Stop work.  Send your employees to the unemployment lines.  Shut down your community centers, factories, retail stores, libraries and restaurants."

Radical environmentalists and their bureaucratic allies in Washington are waging war against the people of Appalachia, and we don't know why.  All we know is that they don't care about us, our families, our heritage, our future.  They would rather see us on welfare than on the job.  

The EPA is sacrificing my future to satisfy a handful of people who've never stepped foot where I live and work, people who want to punish companies that follow the rules that government told them to follow.

Please take action now to stop this war against the people of Appalachia.

Your attention to this issue is vital to the economic viability of our country. Affordable, dependable energy is the life blood of the US economy. We must continue to support all viable sources of energy (including coal) to be able to compete in the world economy. There must be financial discipline must begin to prevail in Washington. The future of America depends on your diligent efforts on behalf of the American people. Your future as a representative in Washington is dependant upon it also.

Not only are you taking away jobs but you will be raising the cost of coal production due to supply. This will increase the cost of the Electric bill in every home that uses power from a coal fired energy system. The cost of daily living is going up and we do not need these type of changes now!!!
