Subject: ILLEGAL ALIENS....

Comment: Governor Perdue, What are you doing to curb the influx of illegals in our state? Is anyone? With jobs at a premium here in NC, illegals are working while U.S. citizens can't find jobs. They're on our welfare rolls, receiving free health care that citizens can't, getting food stamps that legals can't, their children are receiving FREE breakfast and lunch programs, and more, we're teaching our school children to speak Spanish in their own country!!! Isn't something a little backwards here? Why aren't the Spanish speaking children learning ENGLISH? This situation is now out of control. They're driving without licenses, driving with fake licenses, they don't know the rules of our roads and are endangering the lives of every legal citizen on them. I'd like to request a reply to this. Thank you, Gale Kilmer

Comment: Adam Blankenship 2722 Laurelcherry St. Raleigh, NC 27612-5441 November 19, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: Dear Governor Perdue, I'm curious as to your current stance on illegal immigrants in the USA. I've read varying articles in regards to the immigration bills, e-verify and potential amnesty for current illegal immigrants. I'd like to understand what you believe and what you plan to do in regards to this issue. I personally believe that all illegal immigrants should be removed from the country and should follow the established immigration procedure. Amnesty is not a viable option. I've read reports that illegal immigrants currently make up anywhere between 8-12% of the US population. I've also read that the unemployment rate recently topped 10%. Perhaps if illegal immigrants weren't taking jobs away from lawful US citizens, the unemployment rate could be drastically reduced? I also believe that any company found to be employing illegal immigrants should have hefty fines placed against them for each illegal immigrant under employment. These fines could be used as revenue to help fund additional immigration tactics designed to find other illegal immigrants. Or the revenue could be used to pay down our staggering national debt. Please let me know where you stand and where you plan to take my country in regards to this very important issue.

A warrants says that Aviles talked with an undercover officer about being paid to have sex with Jacobo. The men are all scheduled to first appear in court Monday morning. This state is NOT doing enough to rid our communities of these crimials. Wake Cty. jails is full of illegal immigrants. We can not afford to continue to look the other way.

Comment: Governor Bev Perdue, Please explain how is it fair for illegal immigrants to obtain foodstamps and medicaid. We have our own US citizens who have become ill and down and out,however, unable to qualify for any assistance. We've worked all our lives and our money is used to support those that haven't paid taxes, can't speak the English language, and crossed the border illegally. I believe this is also a big part of our economy issue and why so many people are homeless and crime rates are rising. Your response is very much needed and appreciated.

Dear  Governor   Perdue,

I had seen you on TV being interviewed and questioned about the illegal immigrants going to college for free.  The question was pertaining to whether your decision on this was justifiable.

Your response was “It is about the children “. 

These people are not children they are adults. When you reach college years you are an adult. No one is entitled to free education. We work and pay colleges for this. We scholar ourselves  through extreme hard work and studies to have great opportunity to go to college for less money or fully earned.

There are MANY people jobless through this difficult economy,  People who need to be reeducated into a different careers.  

These are Taxpaying American Citizens!   People whom have the right to vote, which you have benefitted from and  so does every political seat.

To hear we have adopted people belonging to different nations to give them Full rides or assistance, when our unemployment rate goes higher, is difficult to comprehend.

Where does it stop?  Why can’t you be the first?

My child goes to public school, He has kids in his class that do not speak English. They go to a resources to be taught the curriculums in Spanish and is being taught English as well. They will graduate and be bilingual. Why isn’t my child being taught Spanish? I am not  speaking of the 9 weeks of Spanish he will get in Middle school.

We have made so many cuts backs on state and local government, and  yet we  find money to give away  to college education for NON US TAXPAYING CITIZENS.  

I am hoping you read this and consider this  and make adjustments to who we give FREE Privileges to.

 Thank you ,

 Mrs. Sandra L Johnson

In 2008 NC spent 1.3 Billion taxpayer dollars on illegal aliens and their children as follows:

.  Prenatal care, mother/infant hospital care
.  Wick, social services, food stamps, child care, etc.
.  ER visits - no co-pay required
.  Education K-12   
.  Crime rate increase (gangs, drugs, stealing and child molestation)
.  Incarceration

Now you want to allow their children to have further education.  Your group stated that these individuals will pay a higher out of state tuition.  I say no to this, for a way will be found to allow NC taxpayers to end up paying for them once again.

These illegal aliens and their children should return home and let their home countries educate them.  If at a later time they wish to further educate themselves in the USA let them apply like other foreigners and then pay a higher rate.

The US needs to crack down on illegal aliens and their children.  They should be deported as a family and extended family members.   I would rather my tax dollars go to deportation than education.

Comment: Iâ€™m writing about the fact that our elected officials are doing nothing, in regards to our illegal immigration problem. Here in N.C. we have experienced a massive influx of illegal immigrants. That is driving down local wages for workers in several trades. They have not had the vaccinations as we have but their children are in school with ours (the law abiding citizens). They don't all come over to work! They have figured out how to drain the welfare system that is supposed to be for American citizens. They clog up all the emergency rooms and don't have to pay, thus driving up health care for all citizens. They also bring drugs and crime across the border with them. It is high time our elected officials showed some back bone and stood up against this invasion of illegal immigrants! Say no to worker visas, do not reward them for breaking the law. Place high fines on American companies employing illegals, no exceptions. I will vote for what ever party or person that finally takes some real action on the situation.

I understand that our esteemed Governor hosted just such convicted criminals at her home for a holiday celebration.  VERY NICE.  Now, can you tell me, is she FOR victims or FOR criminals?  I guess I’m just confused.  And please don’t tell me that she is just continuing an ages old tradition of the Governor’s mansion.  Wrong is Wrong.  Tax payer paid housing for the Governor should not be a place for criminal to enjoy a jolly time.  I also understand that a convicted murderer who killed her husband and one other, with rat poison, was released early, in part, due to a letter of recommendation from Governor Purdue.  So I ask you again, is she FOR criminals?

UPDATE: We know many of you have been following the important issue of the potential release of dozens of inmates sentenced to life in prison.  There were important developments on Friday and we want to keep you up-to-date on the latest news.



Judge Gentry Caudill of Cleveland County on Friday ruled in favor of the state and denied release for Wilbur Folston, one of several inmates sentenced to life in prison in the 1970s whose sentences are in question due to recent court rulings.  Judge Caudill’s ruling directly contradicts Judge Ripley Rand’s decision earlier this week in the cases of inmates Faye Brown and Alford Jones.



In his decision, Judge Caudill ruled that "no Secretary of Correction has ever directed good-behavior credits to be applied to calculate an unconditional release date for a life sentence."



Additionally, the state Supreme Court on Friday afternoon blocked the scheduled release of Brown and Jones and will review the case.  According to news reports the Supreme Court is likely to decide within the next 10 days on a potential hearing.



Governor Perdue believes Judge Caudill’s decision is the correct one as this important issue now moves to the Supreme Court.



The Supreme Court’s decision is the most appropriate step as the state seeks a conclusive answer on how to make sure inmates are not released without a proper and thorough review by the Parole Commission. The bottom line remains: inmates sentenced to life should not be allowed to walk out the prison door without a parole review and appropriate post-release supervision.

Subject: Immigration

Comment: In today's issue of News and Observer (12/20/2009) reads "Deported parents leaving children born in US" This is troubling in so many ways. These parents broke the law arriving in this country and many times fleeing a lawless state. In turn, they get deported and leave their children in a system where others give them welfare. This example lacks for their own parent's supervision, contribution in their lives, society and taxes, etc. Basically, the other citizens take care of their children. What does the future hold for these children when they becoming older, of voting age, and possibly running for office and changing the nation further into what it should not be? Will those children, now elders use American sympathies against the citizens like many currently try to do and are sometimes successful? Would those children, now elders call for their sympathetic congressman to write a bill saying that "deported parents of native born children 35 years ago are eligible for citizenship?" Would it pass? Not far fetched considering today's climate of some wanting a borderless nation and amnesty! There should be an amendment "no children born from illegal immigrants in America can serve in public office." Better yet, "no children born from illegal immigrants in America are also illegal citizens and to keep family integrity will be deported with their parents as well" Why not? You have the backing of each and every single rational, unsympathetic voting, law abiding citizen of America to concur! If I may use a basketball analogy to better understand this logic: When a penalty or violation occurs it is recognized as such and play stops. Any any situation thereafter, unless an intentional flagrant foul cannot be accessed. In other words, it's a lawless game. The first violation is coming to America illegally. The second violation is intentionally having their children born in America. Basically, they are exploiting America, her citizens, and laws against us!. They are playing a game and we might be losing. Time will tell, but if the amendment is passed as I called for, they will not exploit America. A deeper fear is the many eerie similarities of how Roman Civilization eroded and how America is sharping up. They are lead (imports from China), monetary trouble (printing money), military problems (attrition), leadership incompetence (Obama), even the rise of Islam and some say Christianity (in this case, new religions like Liberalism) and last, but not least invasions (current immigration laws). The immigrants are fleeing a sinking ship in large numbers into another ship with an already loaded capacity in ill-conceived hopes of survival. Even many liberals desire population control like abortion and Malthusian so they should be able to comprehend at least this point. Sure, many illegal-immigrants may work the field labor harvesting our crops cheaply, but once they become "legal" should we be so optimistic that they don't desire a raise? Would not this increase costs? As you can see the consequences for illegal immigration is numerous, but if an amendment is crafted as the one noted above, maybe we as American citizens can keep Her going for generations to come.

Subject: ILLEGAL immigrants

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I am contacting you today as I am very upset at our state government. From what I understand, Friday 12-18-09 there was a meeting in Raleigh, held by a committee of non-elected officials, to determine whether or not to allow ILLEGAL immigrants into our community colleges. First of all, this should not even be an issue as they are ILLEGAL! Secondly, this is a matter that should be voted upon by the people of this state and not decided on by some non-elected committee. Not only that but i understand that this meeting was a farce and rigged in favor of the ILLEGALs. This meeting was not very publicized to the public, it was held at a time when hard working, taxpaying citizens who are against ILLEGAL immigration were at work and unable to attend. The ILLEGAL sympathisers were given an opportunity to sign up and speak before the announced time, therefore taking up the majority of time allotted. Many of those who were there to speak against this stupidity were not allowed to speak at all. This is an outrage and a slap in the face to the AMERICAN citizens of this state. Why would we educate those who cannot LEGALLY work in this state not to mention this country? Why are we giving into criminals, yes that is what they are as they have broken our laws and are here ILLEGALLY! It is a fact that over 80% of AMERICAN'S are against AMNESTY or any other benefits to ILLEGALS. We, the AMERICAN citizens want enforcement of our laws. I can't understand how there is not any common sense in our government. You as well as the other politicians in Raleigh were elected by the AMERICAN citizens of this state, not the ILLEGAL's and therefore you are supposed to represent us. It appears though, that many of the elected officials are turning their backs on the AMERICAN citizens and following their own special agenda's. I am urging you to stand with/for the AMERICAN citizens of this state and intervene in this matter. I urge you to enact tougher enforcement of our laws on ILLEGAL immigration. ILLEGAL immigrants are costing the state of NC tens of millions of dollars every year. At a time when millions of AMERICAN citizens of this state are out of work and suffering, we do not need to be educating ILLEGAL's nor providing them with any benefits at all. We need to be providing our law enforcement officials the tools needed to identify, detain and deport ILLEGAL's as well as cracking down on all businesses that hire ILLEGAL's. We need to make it so that every employer be required to use the E-Verify system to make sure that only AMERICAN citizens are getting hired and not ILLEGALs. This is a disgrace and a shame. I should not have to be writing to you in regards to this issue. This should be a no brainer, but evidently it is only the politicians who don't have the common sense to see/understand what ILLEGALs are costing this state as well as this country. Unless something is done, we are doomed. Once again I urge you to step in and do something in regards to the issue of allowing ILLEGAL immigrants into our community colleges as well as the whole issue of ILLEGAL immigrants. Thank you for your time. Rick Guynn Concerned AMERICAN citizen.
