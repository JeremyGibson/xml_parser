My husband and I are voting residents of Asheville and we attended a meeting last week at the Skyland Fire Department. This meeting concerned the CTS TOXIC WASTE SITE on Mills Gap Road. We live approximately 1 mile from this site and we are concerned about our community.

We understand there are 30+ toxic waste sites just in Buncombe County and the County's cost of addressing and cleaning up all of them is enormous......however......what we do not understand is WHY the County, the City, and the State are not addressing the companies that caused the issues. CTE is a viable, very profitable operation situated all over the globe. They have the money put aside for the clean up of their uncounscionable operations and no one in our North Carolina legislature seems to be willing to demand they do it. Not so in California where this was addressed and accomplished. We are having a very difficult time understanding and coming to terms with this reasoning.

This was not the first meeting we attended. We have been to the County Commissioners meeting and the City Council meeting. We have met with our neighbors, have seen documents and heard testimony. The high levels of TCE in the ground water and the vapors in the air have increased, more wells are affected, putting more and more people at risk. This is a documented fact and constitutes an eminent danger. The pollution is spreading and our elected officials, who have vowed to fight for and protect our health and well-being, are sitting on their hands.

Our community, at the very least, needs and deserves CLEAN WATER and CLEAN AIR for all its residents. We expect it.

Respectfully,
Sheila Martin

Ms. Martin,

The sites involved lie outside of city limits and jurisdictional authority.  Nonetheless, Asheville's city council has made an effort to be helpful at points during the process and will likely continue on that course - recognizing our powers are limited in attempting to create meaningful action. 

As regards your expectation of clean water and air, one can certainly appreciate those priorities.  The question remains as to who pays for such. 

The call for extended water lines to compensate for high risk wells certainly resonates - the call to transfer to costs to the city and water users is a point of concern.  Addressing the needs of one victimized group by victimizing another would sidestep the fairness issue that should govern our actions.

I share your belief that ultimate accountability in this matter has not been appropriately resolved.  Until that time, solutions, responsibilities, and costs should be timely but also fairly distributed. 

I will be leaving our Council with a few weeks and will have no likely involvement in future resolutions.  It remains that the fastest track to receiving city services (new water line and system access) will be for those affected to voluntarily become part of the city and share those associated costs.  

I am persistently fascinated with how quickly and enthusiastically so many of us can embrace the pockets of others but hit the pause button when our own pockets are addressed.  The frustrating realities at the CTS site appear to offer no exception.

Carl Mumpower
Asheville City Council

Dear Mrs. Martin -



On behalf of the Buncombe County Commissioners I am responding to your email regarding the CTS site.



Buncombe County is aware that the CTS site is a documented source of chlorinated solvents (TCE) that have been detected at above regulatory standards in soils on site as well as in groundwater and surface water of nearby springs.  However, applicable federal and State environmental laws afford local governments a very limited role in addressing hazardous substance contamination.  Primary responsibility is vested with the EPA and NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  Therefore, Buncombe County is not in a position to require that any particular action be taken by the owners of the site.  All the County can do, as the County Commissioners and staff have done for several years, is "ride herd" on the EPA and DENR as the responsible governing health authorities to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken. 



It is important to remember that the CTS site has been repeatedly evaluated for inclusion on the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL).  This evaluation assesses a score to determine if the site poses a risk to public health deemed high enough to warrant EPA-lead remediation.  However, the site has never scored high enough for inclusion on the NPL.  Presently, there is no known well that has tested positive for TCE in the area that is serving any home.  All homes that were served by any well that has tested positive for TCE are now on city water. 



EPA has compelled the responsible parties, CTS and Mills Gap Assoc., to complete a removal action.  The Responsible Parties are CTS and Mills Gap Associates.  These are the current and former owners.  The County is not in a position to control any clean up of this site. 



At this time another risk assessment is underway, but responsible federal authorities have not released the results.  The County Commissioners have just recently made another request that this report be made public immediately. 



The County has no standing to file legal action against the owners of the site , the Secretary of DENR, or the EPA. (See G/S. 130A-310.5).  Liability for these sites is statutory, and Buncombe is not in that loop.  The County is not in the business of hazardous wastes except as permitted by the State.  Buncombe County is largely preempted by statute [130A-293] and would be liable, as would any person or business entity, as an owner/operator, generator or transporter of the hazardous material. [130A-310.7].  Further, only DENR, through its Secretary, can officially designate when an imminent hazard exists. [130A-310.5]   Of course, EPA could do likewise, but only if the site scored as an NPL site, and this has not happened. 



Finally, only one statute specifically gives a local official any authority that might be used to compel a clean up.  N.C.G.S. §130A-19 provides that if a local health director, or DENR Secretary, determines that a "public health nuisance" exists, they may issue an order of abatement directing that necessary action be taken to abate to public health nuisance.  The phrase "public health nuisance" is not defined in the statute.  If the party refuses to take action then a suit may be instituted in Superior Court to enforce the order.  A local health official has taken such action in North Carolina only once.  Cumberland County's health director did so in concert with DENR when contaminates from an abandoned textile facility made its way into groundwater and a contaminant plume was migrating toward the water treatment facility.  So, that health director did not go it alone.  Here, no risk assessment has been completed.  Before such a drastic measure can be considered we would need a risk assessment concluding that a contaminate plume has created an imminent health risk, and then consult with DENR about what further enforcement actions it plans to take.  This would tie in with our policy on infrastructure expenses. 



Further questions and concerns related to this site may be forwarded to the responsible governing health authorities or elected officials.



Thank you.

It is your interest in having the benefits of city services (water) without the responsibilities (paying city taxes) that illuminates your position.  Although one can be sympathetic to the difficulties of your situation, asking others to subsidize you without your having skin in the game is not my understanding of the concept of fairness.

slide off like water off a duck's back.  If it was his home I bet he would feel differently.  We aren't asking for municpal water for the heck of it...we need it for our health and safety...also we are not just thinking/asking for ourselves but also for our neighbors who are either not inclined to ask, don't have the time, or are scared to.  Whether or not you or I could afford to have municipal water ran to our houses is leaps and bounds from the point.

Even though he is not on the council any more perhaps he will help us somehow, some day, anyway.

Dr. Mumpower......The fairness you are referring to is redundant. What we are asking for is clean water (that we will pay for through monthly or quarterly billing) and clean air that was stolen from this community by the County, the City and the State.......the responsible parties involved in the lack of supervision or monitoring of those profitable companies who contaminated the soil, the water and the air. The legislators that turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the warnings made apparent by documents the EPA registered back in 2002.

FAIRNESS is apparently in the eye of the beholder. Is it FAIR that wells are contaminated and at risk for future contamination? Is it FAIR that our legislators chose not to pay attention to the warnings... the documents they received? Is it fair that real estate dealings were conducted through fraudulent practices. Is it fair that property values have diminished with no warning as to disclosure statements regarding a toxic waste site polluting the community?

FAIRNESS is relevant sir....FAIRNESS is when elected legislators admit to a horrendous miscarriage of justice and do what needs to be done to make it right. FAIRNESS is when responsible parties are held accountable. People have gotten sick and died on your watch......that is NOT FAIR!!!!!!

And where to I see our elected officials demanding that the agencies responsible for monitoring, apply the necessary pressure on the polluting companies.....that's where your MONEY will come from.....I am appalled at the LACK of initiative.

Ms. Martin,

The sites involved lie outside of city limits and jurisdictional authority.  Nonetheless, Asheville's city council has made an effort to be helpful at points during the process and will likely continue on that course - recognizing our powers are limited in attempting to create meaningful action. 

As regards your expectation of clean water and air, one can certainly appreciate those priorities.  The question remains as to who pays for such. 

The call for extended water lines to compensate for high risk wells certainly resonates - the call to transfer to costs to the city and water users is a point of concern.  Addressing the needs of one victimized group by victimizing another would sidestep the fairness issue that should govern our actions.

I share your belief that ultimate accountability in this matter has not been appropriately resolved.  Until that time, solutions, responsibilities, and costs should be timely but also fairly distributed. 

I will be leaving our Council with a few weeks and will have no likely involvement in future resolutions.  It remains that the fastest track to receiving city services (new water line and system access) will be for those affected to voluntarily become part of the city and share those associated costs.  

I am persistently fascinated with how quickly and enthusiastically so many of us can embrace the pockets of others but hit the pause button when our own pockets are addressed.  The frustrating realities at the CTS site appear to offer no exception.

My husband and I are voting residents of Asheville and we attended a meeting last week at the Skyland Fire Department. This meeting concerned the CTS TOXIC WASTE SITE on Mills Gap Road. We live approximately 1 mile from this site and we are concerned about our community.

We understand there are 30+ toxic waste sites just in Buncombe County and the County's cost of addressing and cleaning up all of them is enormous........however......what we do not understand is WHY the County, the City, and the State are not addressing the companies that caused the issues. CTE is a viable, very profitable operation situated all over the globe. They have the money put aside for the clean up of their uncounscionable operations and no one in our North Carolina legislature seems to be willing to demand they do it. Not so in California where this was addressed and accomplished.. We are having a very difficult time understanding and coming to terms with this reasoning.

This was not the first meeting we attended. We have been to the County Commissioners meeting and the City Council meeting. We have met with our neighbors, have seen documents and heard testimony. The high levels of TCE in the ground water and the vapors in the air have increased, more wells are affected, putting more and more people at risk. This is a documented fact and constitutes an eminent danger. The pollution is spreading and our elected officials, who have vowed to fight for and protect our health and well-being, are sitting on their hands.

Our community, at the very least, needs and deserves CLEAN WATER and CLEAN AIR for all its residents. We expect it.

Ms. Martin,

I would not argue with your challenges to the fairness of some of the parties responsible for the oversight at the CTS site. 

That said, your request is for the city of Asheville and our water customers to pick up a significant cost for new water lines.  I am betting that it will happen - will support such if it comes up before I rotate off in early December.  It remains, that those who receive iservice should share in the costs or essentially be doing the same thing to others (transfer impact and costs) that was done to them by CTS.
