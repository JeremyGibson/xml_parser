Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to thank you for standing up for North Carolina's
teens this week by signing the Healthy Youth Act into law.

This law will bring comprehensive sex education to every school
district in North Carolina and will help our state begin to
address our high teen pregnancy and STD rates.

More than 90% of NC parents have expressed that they want
comprehensive sex ed in schools and I appreciate that you
listened to those parents, your constituents, and signed this
bill into law.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to thank you for standing up for North Carolina's
teens this week by signing the Healthy Youth Act into law.

This law will bring comprehensive sex education to every school
district in North Carolina and will help our state begin to
address our high teen pregnancy and STD rates.

More than 90% of NC parents have expressed that they want
comprehensive sex ed in schools and I appreciate that you
listened to those parents, your constituents, and signed this
bill into law.
