Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for recently expressing your support of the Medicaid
Family Planning State Option by signing on to Gov. Strickland's
letter calling for this expansion. 

This small change in federal law will give states the
flexibility to quickly and efficiently expand coverage for basic
preventive health care under Medicaid. If the waiver passes
Congress, women in North Carolina will have greater access to
breast and cervical cancer screenings, contraceptive care, and
prenatal care.

These important services will not only save the state money, but
they will also allow underserved and uninsured women and
families to be more proactive about their health. 
During these tough economic times, it is particularly important
to expand Medicaid coverage, as many Americans are being forced
to forgo services to make ends meet. 

Unfortunately, going without these valuable preventive services
usually ends up costing the state more money and places the
health of individuals and communities at risk.

Thank you for standing with Gov. Strickland on this critical
expansion of health care services. 


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for recently expressing your support of the Medicaid
Family Planning State Option by signing on to Gov. Strickland's
letter calling for this expansion. 

This small change in federal law will give states the
flexibility to quickly and efficiently expand coverage for basic
preventive health care under Medicaid. If the waiver passes
Congress, women in North Carolina will have greater access to
breast and cervical cancer screenings, contraceptive care, and
prenatal care.

These important services will not only save the state money, but
they will also allow underserved and uninsured women and
families to be more proactive about their health. 
During these tough economic times, it is particularly important
to expand Medicaid coverage, as many Americans are being forced
to forgo services to make ends meet. 

Unfortunately, going without these valuable preventive services
usually ends up costing the state more money and places the
health of individuals and communities at risk.

Thank you for standing with Gov. Strickland on this critical
expansion of health care services. 


Sincerely,
Huey Weaver

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for recently expressing your support of the Medicaid
Family Planning State Option by signing on to Gov. Strickland's
letter calling for this expansion. 

Since the early 1990s, 27 states have been granted federal
permission to expand their Medicaid family planning coverage.
These expansions have been unqualified successes, providing care
to millions of women while saving states millions of dollars. 

This small change in federal law will give states the
flexibility to quickly and efficiently expand coverage for basic
preventive health care under Medicaid. If the waiver passes
Congress, women in North Carolina will have greater access to
breast and cervical cancer screenings, contraceptive care, and
prenatal care.

Unfortunately, going without these valuable preventive services
usually ends up costing the state more money and places the

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for recently expressing your support of the Medicaid
Family Planning State Option by signing on to Gov. Strickland's
letter calling for this expansion. 

This small change in federal law will give states the
flexibility to quickly and efficiently expand coverage for basic
preventive health care under Medicaid. If the waiver passes
Congress, women in North Carolina will have greater access to
breast and cervical cancer screenings, contraceptive care, and
prenatal care.

These important services will not only save the state money, but
they will also allow underserved and uninsured women and
families to be more proactive about their health. 
During these tough economic times, it is particularly important
to expand Medicaid coverage, as many Americans are being forced
to forgo services to make ends meet. 

Unfortunately, going without these valuable preventive services
usually ends up costing the state more money and places the
health of individuals and communities at risk.

Thank you for standing with Gov. Strickland on this critical
expansion of health care services.
