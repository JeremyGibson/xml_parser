Comment: James Anderson 29 Jeff Dr Asheville, NC 28806-8858 August 6, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: Mrs. Perdue, I am asking you to oppose this anti-hunting, anti-dog breeder bill, promoted by the radical Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). Do not link ALL commercial breeders with the same broad brush used to condemn so-called "puppy mills". There are plenty of breeders with good moral values in this state that provide quality puppies in a loving and caring environment. Your already on very thin ice with the educators in our state that helped put you in office, please don't make more poor choices that will further decrease your chances for re-election. Sincerely, James Anderson Educator, Retired USAF Sincerely, James Anderson 828 699-2332 Employer Name: Buncombe County Schools Employer City: Asheville Position: Teacher Are you a registered voter?: Yes Did you vote in the last election?: Yes Age: 48 Gender: Male Organization: Democrate Would you like a reply?: Yes Have you visited our website?: Yes
