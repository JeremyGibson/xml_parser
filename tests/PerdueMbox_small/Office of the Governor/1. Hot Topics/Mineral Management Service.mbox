Please reply to carr117169@bellsouth.net

I am writing to ask you to keep energy prices low and create jobs in the United States by supporting oil and natural gas development in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Americans need a comprehensive domestic energy security plan that includes oil and natural gas exploration at the level needed to ensure affordable energy for American families and businesses.

The Department of Energy estimates that enough oil and natural gas could be recovered safely from deep ocean production in America`s OCS to fuel 65 million cars and heat 63.2 million households for 60 years.

Even as the country focuses on utilizing less carbon-intensive sources of energy, the Department of Energy projects that in 2030 oil and natural gas will be required to meet 55.3 percent of our energy needs.

In an economic environment where jobs are being lost all across the country, domestic energy development will create reliable jobs that provide robust compensation and benefits packages while encouraging manufacturing growth and consumer spending by keeping energy affordable.

I support exploration of oil and natural gas resources from the large, publicly owned reserves off America`s coasts and ask you to ensure a robust offshore leasing program in the OCS 5 Year Plan currently under development.

Sincerely,
