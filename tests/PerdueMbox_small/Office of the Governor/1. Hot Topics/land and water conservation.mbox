Subject: Funding for NC Land Conservation Trust Funds

Comment: Peter Bromley 871 Barnes Rd Eden, NC 27288-7507 July 5, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: You represent me in the General Assembly and I am contacting you in regard to an issue important to me and to many of your constituents. The next Biennial Budget is now in Conference Committee where differences between House and Senate Budgets will be resolved. One of the items to be addressed is the funding level for the land conservation trust funds in the new biennium. Please support funding levels for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and the Agriculture and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund at historical levels for these important programs. The Senate Budget puts $95 million into the CWMTF (of the historical level of $100 million) and the House Budget puts $2 million into the Agriculture/Farmland Preservation Trust Fund (of the historical level of $4 million). While these levels are not as high as needed, they will allow continuation of important land acquisition projects and programs to protect our farmlands as we work through our current budget problems. Conservation funds have been put to good use across North Carolina in the past and we must continue our investment to protect our natural resources in the future. Please support the Senate version of the budget ($95 million) for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and the House version of the budget ($2 million) for the Agriculture / Farmland Preservation Trust Fund. Thank you. Sincerely, Peter Bromley

Subject: Please Restore Clean Water Management Trust Funds

Comment: Gregg Antemann 550 E. Westinghouse Blvd. Charlotte, NC 28273-5774 July 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Please consider transferring roughly $27 million back to the Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF) to pay for a group of land acquisition projects and issue $17 million in the Certificates of Participation (COP) for the most time sensitive approved projects. My small business and our industry greatly depend on the CWMTF to fund projects that we provide contracting and consulting services to on a daily basis. I understand that you have had to make tough choices to balance the state's current budget, including transferring money from several trust funds into the general fund to meet cash flow needs. I know those decisions were not easy. I also appreciate all that you have done over the years to create and support full funding for the CWMTF. Your leadership has resulted in hundreds of water quality success stories throughout North Carolina. There are 37 land acquisition projects that were approved by the CWMTF, totaling $27,695,520, in which the land trust or local government is legally obligated to pay the landowner because they have a signed option or contract with the landowner. In some of these cases, the transactions are already closed between the land trust and the landowner, including several instances in which the land trust must repay a loan which enabled them to close the deal. They now have no way to repay the loan without possibly selling the property. Also, the current budget includes $50 million in Certificates of Participation for acquisition projects funded by the Natural Heritage Trust Fund and Parks and Recreation Trust Fund. To date, only $10 million in COP's have been issued. I urge you to issue approximately $17 million in COP's for six pending conservation projects. These represent the most time-sensitive of the $40 million remaining. Sincerely, Gregg Antemann

As you make final budget decisions, I urge you to support adequate funding for both the N.C. Agricultural Development & Farmland Preservation Trust Fund (ADFPTF) and the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF). Our state continues to lead the nation in the number of farms lost each year. Funding for the ADFPTF can change that. In addition, there are more than 190 local land conservation and water quality projects in 71 counties at risk if negotiators do not agree on substantial funding for the CWMTF. Land and water conservation is essential to our economic security and public health. It protects our clean air and drinking water, supports our multibillion-dollar agriculture and tourism industries, sustains our parks and game lands and safeguards North Carolina's unique natural heritage. Conservation funds have been put to good use across the state in the past. We must continue to make these investments for our future. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration.

Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF). Our state continues to lead the nation in the number of farms lost each year. Funding for the ADFPTF can change that. In addition, there are more than 190 local land conservation and water quality projects in 71 counties at risk if negotiators do not agree on substantial funding for the CWMTF. Farmland requires much less revenue than developed areas and in fact subsidizes the developed areas,therefore farmland preservation is essential for NC, especially in the mountains. Land and water conservation is essential to our economic security and public health. It protects our clean air and drinking water, supports our multibillion-dollar agriculture and tourism industries, sustains our parks and game lands and safeguards North Carolina's unique natural heritage. Conservation funds have been put to good use across the state in the past. We must continue to make these investments for our future. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Leslie Smathers 828-648-1490

The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has been working to preserve irreplaceable coastal lands from Currituck to Calabash since 1993. In that time we have protected over 44,000 acres of land. Instrumental in these conservation efforts is funding from the state of North Carolina. Our work depends on state support, and we implore you to provide funding for the preservation of the coastal lands that we all love and cherish, so that future generations may do the same. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Cassandra Gavin

Comment: Bill Sandifer 416 Latimer Road Raleigh, NC 27609-5906 July 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Governor Perdue, I'm sure you're aware of the latest tourism revenue figures, about $17 billion, tourism now running neck and neck with military contributions. I'm sure you're also aware that what remains of North Carolina's natural resources is key in attracting tourists. It's distressing that the majority of efforts to preserve and improve our environment comes from grassroots work, often with little or no help from the state. Sadly, even state agencies charged with environmental preservation/improvement are frequently under political fire from special interests which have the ears of the legislature and government officials. I ask that you support key agencies such as the state Agricultural Development & Farmland Preservation Trust Fund and the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and others by restoring a reasonable level of funding commensurate with hard economic times. It's also crucial that state environmental workers, often striving against apparently insurmountable opposition, be shielded from constant political meddling and harassment. The only way we'll continue to experience prosperity from increased tourism is take care of the goose that lays the golden egg: our state's environment. Sincerely, Bill Sandifer

Subject: Funding for Land and Water Conservation

Comment: Carl Silverstein 22 Pickens Lane Weaverville, NC 28787-9321 July 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Protection of our land and water resources is in jeopardy. As you make final budget decisions, I urge you to support adequate funding for both the N.C. Agricultural Development & Farmland Preservation Trust Fund (ADFPTF) and the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF). Our state continues to lead the nation in the number of farms lost each year. Funding for the ADFPTF can change that. In addition, there are more than 190 local land conservation and water quality projects in 71 counties at risk if negotiators do not agree on substantial funding for the CWMTF. Land and water conservation is essential to our economic security and public health. It protects our clean air and drinking water, supports our multibillion-dollar agriculture and tourism industries, sustains our parks and game lands and safeguards North Carolina's unique natural heritage. Conservation funds have been put to good use across the state in the past. We must continue to make these investments for our future. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Carl Silverstein

Subject: Please Support Funding for the Land Conservation Trust Funds from Sig Hutchinson

Comment: Sig Hutchinson 2704 Snowy Meadow Ct. Raleigh, NC 27614-7586 July 8, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Protection of our land and water resources is in jeopardy. As you make final budget decisions, I urge you to support adequate funding for both the N.C. Agricultural Development & Farmland Preservation Trust Fund (ADFPTF) and the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF). These funds plus the PARTF have an significant impact on our water quality, air quality and quality of life. To that end, the opportunity has never been greater as we continue to grow as a state and with the down turn in the economy, the opportunity to purchase available land has never been better as well. Our state continues to lead the nation in the number of farms lost each year. Funding for the ADFPTF can change that. In addition, there are more than 190 local land conservation and water quality projects in 71 counties at risk if negotiators do not agree on substantial funding for the CWMTF. Land and water conservation is essential to our economic security and public health. It protects our clean air and drinking water, supports our multibillion-dollar agriculture and tourism industries, sustains our parks and game lands and safeguards North Carolina's unique natural heritage. Conservation funds have been put to good use across the state in the past. We must continue to make these investments for our future. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Sig Hutchinson 919-740-8848

That is what makes NC so attractive. And the public insurance option is critical to Obama's plan. And I support it. And I supported you! Thank you for considering this. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Julia Mack 9192874345

As you make final budget decisions, I urge you to support adequate funding for both the N.C. Agricultural Development & Farmland Preservation Trust Fund (ADFPTF) and the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund (CWMTF). I am the Chairman of Foothills Conservancy of NC, Treasurer of Resource Institute, Inc., National Trustee of Trout Unlimited, and Board member of the Muddy Creek Partnership. The significant and numerous projects the non-profit organizations I work with can not be sustained without your continued support of both the ADFPTF and CWMTF. I have spent the past 24 years working steadfastly as a volunteer to help protect farmlands, save large tracts of land for transfer to public ownership, enhance water quality, and restore watersheds throughout North Carolina. My efforts would not have proven successful or have even been attempted were it not for your long-term and consistent support of these two programs. I travel throughout the country giving programs discussing the various projects I have been able to complete, and in every case, in every state, the audience is amazed by the commitment NC has to our environment and future. Don't let that commitment end with the current economic situation. We owe our children and future North Carolinians no less than the vision that has been consistent for the past decade. I urge your continued support of these programs. The Senate budget includes $95 million for the CWMTF, and Gov. Perdue's proposed budget includes $75 million. I urge you to support funding in that range, and encourage you to include at least $2 million for the ADFPTF. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Michael R. "Squeak" Smith 828 584-2848
