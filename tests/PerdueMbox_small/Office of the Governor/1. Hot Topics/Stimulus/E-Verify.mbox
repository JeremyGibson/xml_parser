Subject: e-verify for stimulus fund jobs

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, It would seem only logical that those who receive jobs from the stimulus bill should be legal citizens of North Carolina. Will you support the legislation to require e-verify of all workers who receive employment that is made possible through the expenditure of federal stimulus funds? Thank you, William M. Griffin Indian Trail, NC

Comment: Governor Perdue, I hope you support the EVerify program and especially now with stimulus money coming to our state. There are too many illegal immigrants in our state and one of your job requirements is to make sure citizens of NC who pay the taxes are safe and are working. I did not vote for you but am willing to give you benefit of the doubt that you WILL do the right thing. Thanks for your time.

Subject: Stimulus Funds and e-varify

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a United States citizen and a resident of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The reason for my email is to respectfully demand that you require that any company receiving stimulus funds for a project be required to e-varify every employee who is paid with those funds. Those funds are, in part, MY MONEY, and my grand children's money, and it should only be used to pay citizens of the United States. This is not a complicated issue. It doesn't require days or hours of research, it only requires that you do the right thing.

	Dear Governor Perdue:

I am wanting to know why the State Unemployment Offices (ESC) are not E-Verifying all I-9s on immigrants.

Isn't the State Employment Commission under the SB1523 law required to E-Verify everyone they send for a job?

SB 1523 - Passed in 2006, SB 1523 requires all state agencies, offices, and universities to use E-Verify. The law applied to all employees hired after January 1, 2007 except for local education agencies which was March 1, 2007.

I look forward to your comments on this issue illegal workers in North Carolina taking legal residents and North Carolina citizens' jobs.

Thank you,
Valinda Norton

Comment: Governor Purdue, Where do you stand supporting e-check as a way to help stem the tide of illegal immigration? This is not a gray area. You are either supporting those who proceed in a legal way to live and work in North Carolina or you support those who choose to ignore the laws. E-check has proven to be highly accurate. Claims to the contrary are bogus and self-serving for those making the claims. There are enough stresses on our state's economy that we do not need more through the weight of illegal imigrants and their families affecting schools, assisted housing, welfare costs, etc. Do the right thing and support e-check.

Subject: e-verify program

Comment: My name is Shane Furr, i am a citizen of cabarrus county of north carolina. I am writing to you today to voice my concerns on the stimulus money coming to north carolina. I have learned than you will not use the e-verify program with any contractors that are awarded with the stimulus money so to asure that all workers are us citizens that work on these projects. I, as a american citizen and as a taxpayer to the state of north carolina ask you to make sure that this program is used to the fullest. I am sure that the stimulus money is never going to help me , as an average citizen , but i am VERY APPOSED to any money going to illegal aliens Who DO NOT PAY ANY TAXES much less belong here in the first place. So i hope that you would reconsider any plans that you have in not allowing this program to be used. This is not just a N.C. plea, but also a US citizen plea, both that i HOPE you are ALSO. So I ask you as my governor to answer this question with these simple answers YES, NO, NO COMMENT as if you are going to use the e-verify program. I will be waiting to hear back from you on this important matter. Thank You, Shane Furr

Subject: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Comment: Will the federal stimulus money be used to insure North Carolinian American citizens are getting the jobs which "may" be created by this money? Tara Sevatious of News Talk 1110 radio has asked "yes, no, or no comment on requiring e-verify for contractors hired with stimulus funds", which will it be? ANSWER THE QUESTION! I would suggest we do what South Carolina's governor is doing, use the money to pay down our states debt. Then reduce state taxes.

Subject: Where are my tax dollars going

Comment: Dear Beverly Perdue,I understand it is a tough time being governor at this time in the economy, however you are the representative of the people, me being one of them. I would kindly ask that MY tax dollars are not given to ANYONE that is not a legal citizen and does not share in the burden of having to fork over thier hard earned money. In case you are missing what I, as a legal tax-paying citizen, am asking is that the state of North Carolina ensure stimulus money goes into the correct hands. Whether using E-verify, or other means to promptly handle this matter. Thank You, Nicole Martin, a concerned citizen.

Comment: Governor Perdue, Please do what you can to make it a requirement of the state of North Carolina that all contractors hired for projects funded by the stimulus funds must use e-verify to insure that those monies and jobs are not going to illegal immigrants. I have heard this question asked of you and Mr. Hackney, but not heard any reply. Thank you.

Subject: Your Silence is Deafening

Comment: I wrote to you earlier asking about whether or not you support using e-verify when hiring workers on governmnet projects. I have received no reply. I mentioned my 23-year old son, a native North Carolinian, who is a construction worker now making pizzas. Even when he had a construction job, the pay was low due to the influx of illegal aliens that drive down the cost of labor. These are dangerous jobs in all kinds of weather. Raising the minimum wage is not the answer. Yes, we got CHANGE all right...for the worse. I am extremely disappointed but not surprised.
