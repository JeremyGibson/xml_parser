My name is Helene Winograd. I am a resident of Pender County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

We want to keep our air clean and free of toxins!
Stop  Titan from building a factory in our area.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Helene Winograd

It seems outrageous to me that this polluter,mercury emmitting plant would even be considered for our area.It will produce 10x the amount of cement used in our area over the last 4 yrs. Please listen to the people   PLEASE NO TITAN

I am concerned about the pandora's box of risks associated with the operation of this plant.  Mercury is highly toxic.  I have lived in Wilmington for over 20 years.  My son and grandchild are living here - I see this plant as a threat to our environment which does not justify the questionable boost to the economy it may bring.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

My name is James W. Summey III. I am a resident of Brunswick County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I am a former elected official of Wrightsville Beach Board of Aldermen and past Chairman of the Board of New Hanover Regional Medical Center.  I am appalled at the thought that in this day and time we would permit such an operation without mandating the best available control technology be fully utilized in such an industry.  If they are not willing to fully invest in improving the well being of our area, then we can do without them.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

This automated Spam campaign is counter productive to your cause of delaying the Titan Cement company.

Jamming our e-mail boxes with crap will force us to block all e-mails from your servers and you will not be able to get updates to us as critle issues develop.

Wilmington City Council is not in the decision loop for this project and these contacts are a waste of out time.

At your Service,

Hon. Ronald W. Sparks, PE

My name is lynn. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, lynn

As you know, Property values have already dropped in New Hanover County. By allowing Titan to invade our neighborhood values will contiue to drop. As each of the affected property owners request an adjustment in their property taxes the CVounty will loose more because of Titan than they could ever hope to gain. As news gets out about our "Dirty Little County", No one in their right mind will want to move here. Gets uglier ang uglier doesn't it?

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

Be the 5th highest mercury emitting facility in the state and the largest in southeastern NC. It would be the
11th highest mercury emitting cement plant in the nation. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that causes
disabilities in children, infants, and the unborn. New Hanover County already has the 6th highest mercury
emissions in the state. Titanâ€™s plant would move us to 3rd. I AM A 5 YEAR CANCER SURVIVOR AND WE NEED CLEAN AIR!!!

I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My name is Barbara Canarsa. I am a resident of Brunswick County and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

As a resident of New Hanover County whose water is drawn from the aquifer that Titan plans to impact I do not want to see this plant in operation.  Furthermore, as a resident living off Sidbury Road I am very very close to the smokestacks that will be putting mercury and other pollutants into the air.  As a professor at UNCW and a scientist I find no justification for the acceptance of an industry into this county that would degrade our environment to the extent that Titan would.  Any of my legislators who are passive on this subject or support Titan's wish to accept anything but the most strict of regulations on emissions will not only lack my future support, but will encounter my active opposition.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.

According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

The amount of mercury which comes from the old TVA plants in Tennessee into NC has already caused much of our seafood to be unsafe to eat, and has already been given a "free pass" by the Bush administration for far too long. To add to this pollution plus the possibility of pollution of our drinking water and the despoilment of our wetlands, and to PAY for the privilege out of public funds is totally irrational. We are retirees who moved here from New York BECAUSE of the natural beauty, lack of smog, and healthier environment of the area 11 years ago. Why let a polluting industry spoil the environment that we and others have found so desirable? And for what paltry benefit? It is also clear to us that careful consideration of the air and water quality issues should be given after the Obama administration is given a chance to weigh in on sensible, scientifically-based restrictions. We strongly object to one cent of our taxpayer dollars being spent to encourage Titan. It is extr!
 emely short-sighted. Spend that money in attracting clean businesses to the state, and keep Titan out.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My name is Kemp Burdette. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I am a father of one with a second on the way and mercury hurts babies in and out of the womb. I have enjoyed spending time on the Northeast Cape Fear River since childhood and destroying wetlands will take the opportunity to share this special place with my children away from me. Please think in the long term rather than the short. Why allow an industry with a shameful track record make money on our future? Wouldn't we rather see the Castle Hayne Corridor sustaining family neighborhoods and parks-which by the way create jobs for our community. You have a chance to be a hero to our community please tell Titan no.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My employer donated to your campaign because we know you are representing our best interests in our area. this is not in the best interest of the people in our county,there are many places in further outlaying areas where the impact wouldnt effect a semi urban area.Thanks ,David Deaton(On behalf of Kenny Batts) Thank you for your time

I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

My name is Timothy H. Stone. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

     I am a parent of 3 school-aged children in New Hanover County. We determine the baseline so that they may better the quality of life in our region.
     The consideration of Titan as an addition to our region offers no long range benefits -only short-sighted monetary "carrots". Please consider the deadly toxic effects that Titan will have 20, 30, 100 years from now on our citizens, air, land and water. They have proven to be an unconscionable neighbor in other regions.
     You have been elected to represent us. Do so responsibly.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

We just moved here from Los Angeles, where the air is horrible, and you get sick from being in the ocean. I can't see why anyplace should be allowed to destroy the health of our children, for what?
What is worth that much?   Once you destroy things, you can't go back.  How much money do the Greeks and others have to make to justify the birth defects they cause?

Additionally, I am, like many of my neighbors and friends in Wilmington, a small business owner, and a father of three, with the freedom to choose where I live with my family.  If Titan is successful in their attempts to build and operate a plant this close to my home and my childrens schools I will without reservation move my business and family out of state. We have chosen to live here for one very good reason.....the environment. In your weighing of the economic benefits of newly created cement factory jobs be sure to weigh in the impacts from the lossess of not just a few small businesses who will leave the area as a result.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

My name is Catherine Elizabeth Connell. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I own my own physical therapy clinic in Wilmington NC.  I am a mother of two children.  My oldest son suffers from Cystic Fibrosis which is a chronic lung disease and he has frequent bouts with asthma.  He has been hospitalized at the University of North Carolina Children's Pulmonary Clinic a dozen times in his brief 13 years.  It is a good year for our family if he makes it through a year without a hospital stay.  Being concerned with air quality is a daily part of our lives.  The best therapy for my son is to be outside and active which helps combat his breathing problems.  I am extremely concerned with the plans for the Titan Cement plant in Castle Hayne NC.  Please help by not letting Titan slip by and receive their permit.  At the very least don't let them slip under the wire and get it before March when the regulations become more stringent.  Thank you for your consideration.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Catherine Elizabeth Connell

Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

Please review this project.  It is a disaster and the long term impact is horrible.  Regardless of the zoning question, this is bad news for all children and citizens in general.  Our mayor and city councel are OUT OF CONTROL AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  Follow the money not only for this project but for all big budget projects including the convention center.  They do not represent the people which they were sworn to do.  The list goes on and on.  Please do the right thing and help, you all are the only power that can.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done.

My name is Christine Brueck. I am a resident of Wilmington and I strongly oppose the proposed Titan Cement plant, which would be the fourth largest cement plant in the nation.

I urge you as an elected official from this region to support an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina until all the impacts of this heavy polluting industry on our environment and public health are known.

Cement plants are among the worst polluting industries in the country. They emit hundreds of thousands of pounds of smog- and haze-forming pollutants, as well as toxic heavy metals and known carcinogens. Titan has asked to emit the maximum amount of mercury currently allowed under federal law--263 pounds per year. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that causes birth defects in children and heart disease in adults, among many other illnesses. I’ve learned that some 8,700 students will be attending schools within five miles of the Titan site by the time the plant could be up and running--and our newest K-12 campus is less than two miles from the site. According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

I am a mother of 2 and a business owner here in Wilmington. I think there are so many things in life to worry about that if there are ANY health or environmental concerns about the Titan plant, why would anyone want to support it? If it's because of the supposed $$ it would bring to the area, think of all the businesses and people we would lose because of it. I know that i would leave the area and people will not come to visit this area for vacation either. How many times have you planned to vacation near a cement plant that with smoking stacks and pollutants? There are lots of other beaches and historic cities visit w/o smoke stacks and pollutants. I'd like to know where the executives of Titan live. I doubt near one of their plants.

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment. This will allow Titan to receive their air permit from the Department of Air Quality and begin construction of this major polluting facility before any environmental studies have been done. I’ve also learned that if Titan gets a permit before new stricter EPA rules are published in April, they will be grandfathered in as an 'existing source' with much weaker pollution control requirements! This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.

The public was promised a thorough review of all the impacts before this plant was built. That is not happening. I strongly urge you to do everything in your power to protect the children of this region and stop this project before it is too late by supporting an immediate moratorium on cement plants in North Carolina.

Sincerely, Christine Brueck

According to a recent USA Today report, our schools already rank among the worst in the nation for their exposure to toxic industrial emissions. Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

Additionally, I am a UNCW student majoring in marine biology and chemistry. From my classes, I have learned about the effects of pollutants such as mercury, dioxins, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, PCBs, PAHs, all of which (and many more) come from cement plants. The environmental and health-related impacts of these chemicals need to be investigated and thoroughly considered before we subject ourselves to such a shock. Furthermore, the placement of Titan Cement on the Cape Fear may seriously comprise our local ecosystem; as a biology student at UNCW this will truly comprise my education. I selected UNCW because of its strong reputation for research and field work...in many of my classes we travel around the Cape Fear watershed to get hands-on experience working with flora, fauna, and research methods. The chemicals and wastes produced by Titan Cement will undoubtedly change and degrade the Cape Fear and make it a less valuable ecosystem t!
 o study. Please support a moratorium until all impacts have been assessed!

I’ve recently learned that Titan has negotiated its way out of the State Environmental Policy Act process, which is supposed to be required of any project using public funds that will have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

Increasing our children’s exposure to these toxins is unacceptable.

Please don't let Titan wiggle out of its environmental responsibilities just so it can make immense profits while threatening our children's health with mercury neurotoxins, all in the name of making more cement which New Hanover County doesn't need anyway.  Especially after the recent revelations of Detroit and Wall Street's unconscionable greed (flying to DC in corporate jets to ask for - and get - billions of our tax dollars), I am sick  of mega-corporations like Titan still putting their profits before the health of our children.

Please empower the people by being the voice for the voiceless.

Thank you.  Dr. David Fourqurean.
