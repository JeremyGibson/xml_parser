Subject: Not buying buses from Thomas Built Buses

Comment: I think it is pretty bad when you go from NC to purchases buses. You are taking jobs from this state. By not buying buses from them, you are putting people out work and families in trouble of losing their homes.. I think thats pretty bad. I thought as a taxs payer we buy the buses. Thank you so much for reading this.
