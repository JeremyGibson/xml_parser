Subject: PCS Phosphate Plant in Aurora, NC

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, There is a very real danger that PCS Phosphate will not be awarded the permits needed to continue mining. The Corp of Engineers and now the EPA are fighting issuing the permit. If the plant closes 1200 people + numerous contractors will be out of work and the Town of Aurora will shut down. The pit are ugly, but provide a much needed product that is used by farmers in NC and around the world. If you could see how the pits are restored after mining is finished you would be surprised. For every acre that is used 1 1/2 acres of wetlands are restored. They have been mining for years and the old areas have been restored to beautiful, scenic wetlands. My question is whether the State of NC and the Governor is fighting to keep the plant open or are you going to knuckle under to the EPA? I have all respect for environmentalist, but not at the the expense of thousands of people who will be out of work and not able to find a job here in Eastern NC! Paula Morrone

Subject: PCS Permits

Comment: It was reported in our local paper today that the EPA has asked for additional review of PCS Phosphate's application for permits. This has been going on long enough! Please Governor Perdue, we need for you to support Beaufort County just like we supported you in your governor's race. It would be a sad day for Beaufort County if we lost PCS. Thanks you! Jill Lee

Subject: PCS Phosphate - Aurora, NC

Comment: Why is the State of NC trying to shut down PCS Phosphate where hundreds of us are employed? We need and rely on PCS for our livlihood and the federal government approved their expansion to stay open and keep our jobs and now the state of nc is trying to prevent expansion and cause hundreds (and thousands indirectly) to lose OUR jobs....WHY?

As an employee, I want to offer my sincere thanks to you for your strong support of PCS Phosphate while the company tries to secure the necessary permits that will allow it to continue operating. I also ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed PCS Phosphate that the Record of Decision (ROD) on the 404 wetlands permit is essentially complete; however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not accepting the ROD. On April 3rd, EPA requested the Assistant Secretary for the Army at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. review the Corps` decision to issue the necessary wetlands permit that will allow the company to continue mining.

In addition, after more than eight years in this permitting process, EPA has proposed yet another boundary change, which represents a significant reduction in potential minable area, adds considerable costs and will cause further delays. EPA also proposes that a conservation easement be placed on all bypassed areas, preventing PCS from mining any of these areas in the future. Neither of these proposals is practicable and PCS has expressed its disappointment in EPA`s response, particularly given the company`s commitment to environmental stewardship and its track record in this regard.

It is important to note that although some refer to this project as the `largest wetland impact in state history,` what they fail to mention is that the impact will occur over a 35-year period. In addition, PCS Phosphate mitigates on a 2:1 ratio up front, replacing two wetland acres for every one wetland acre mined, and then reclaims mined land once the mining is complete. Combining the mitigation and reclamation, this will be the largest wetlands restoration in state history, leaving twice as many wetlands and three times as much wildlife habitat as we have today.

As Beaufort County`s largest private employer, with approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 1,000 contractors, and a sound environmental record, it is unbelievable that this company`s license to operate is being put in jeopardy.
Again, I ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Thank you in advance for your consideration on this critical issue to Beaufort County and all of eastern North Carolina.

In addition, PCS Phosphate mitigates on a 2:1 ratio up front, replacing two wetland acres for every one wetland acre mined, and then reclaims mined land once the mining is complete. Combining the mitigation and reclamation, this will be the largest wetlands restoration in state history, leaving twice as many wetlands and three times as much wildlife habitat as we have today.

As Beaufort County`s largest private employer, with approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 1,000 contractors, and a sound environmental record, it is unbelievable that this company`s license to operate is being put in jeopardy.
Again, I ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Thank you in advance for your consideration on this critical issue to Beaufort County and all of eastern North Carolina.

As a family member of a PCS employee, I want to offer my sincere thanks to you for your strong support of PCS Phosphate while the company tries to secure the necessary permits that will allow it to continue operating. I also ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed PCS Phosphate that the Record of Decision (ROD) on the 404 wetlands permit is essentially complete; however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not accepting the ROD. On April 3rd, EPA requested the Assistant Secretary for the Army at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. review the Corps` decision to issue the necessary wetlands permit that will allow the company to continue mining.

In addition, after more than eight years in this permitting process, EPA has proposed yet another boundary change, which represents a significant reduction in potential minable area, adds considerable costs and will cause further delays. EPA also proposes that a conservation easement be placed on all bypassed areas, preventing PCS from mining any of these areas in the future. Neither of these proposals is practicable and PCS has expressed its disappointment in EPA`s response, particularly given the company`s commitment to environmental stewardship and its track record in this regard.

It is important to note that although some refer to this project as the `largest wetland impact in state history,` what they fail to mention is that the impact will occur over a 35-year period.

It is important to note that although some refer to this project as the `largest wetland impact in state history,` what they fail to mention is that the impact will occur over a 35-year period. In addition, PCS Phosphate mitigates on a 2:1 ratio up front, replacing two wetland acres for every one wetland acre mined, and then reclaims mined land once the mining is complete. Combining the mitigation and reclamation, this will be the largest wetlands restoration in state history, leaving twice as many wetlands and three times as much wildlife habitat as we have today.

As Beaufort County`s largest private employer, with approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 1,000 contractors, and a sound environmental record, it is unbelievable that this company`s license to operate is being put in jeopardy.
Again, I ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Thank you in advance for your consideration on this critical issue to Beaufort County and all of eastern North Carolina.

As a family member of a PCS employee, I want to offer my sincere thanks to you for your strong support of PCS Phosphate while the company tries to secure the necessary permits that will allow it to continue operating. I also ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed PCS Phosphate that the Record of Decision (ROD) on the 404 wetlands permit is essentially complete; however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not accepting the ROD. On April 3rd, EPA requested the Assistant Secretary for the Army at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. review the Corps` decision to issue the necessary wetlands permit that will allow the company to continue mining.

In addition, after more than eight years in this permitting process, EPA has proposed yet another boundary change, which represents a significant reduction in potential minable area, adds considerable costs and will cause further delays. EPA also proposes that a conservation easement be placed on all bypassed areas, preventing PCS from mining any of these areas in the future. Neither of these proposals is practicable and PCS has expressed its disappointment in EPA`s response, particularly given the company`s commitment to environmental stewardship and its track record in this regard.

In addition, PCS Phosphate mitigates on a 2:1 ratio up front, replacing two wetland acres for every one wetland acre mined, and then reclaims mined land once the mining is complete. Combining the mitigation and reclamation, this will be the largest wetlands restoration in state history, leaving twice as many wetlands and three times as much wildlife habitat as we have today.

As Beaufort County`s largest private employer, with approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 1,000 contractors, and a sound environmental record, it is unbelievable that this company`s license to operate is being put in jeopardy.
Again, I ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Thank you in advance for your consideration on this critical issue to Beaufort County and all of eastern North Carolina.

Sincerely,

As a retiree, I want to offer my sincere thanks to you for your strong support of PCS Phosphate while the company tries to secure the necessary permits that will allow it to continue operating. I also ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed PCS Phosphate that the Record of Decision (ROD) on the 404 wetlands permit is essentially complete; however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not accepting the ROD. On April 3rd, EPA requested the Assistant Secretary for the Army at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. review the Corps` decision to issue the necessary wetlands permit that will allow the company to continue mining.

In addition, after more than eight years in this permitting process, EPA has proposed yet another boundary change, which represents a significant reduction in potential minable area, adds considerable costs and will cause further delays. EPA also proposes that a conservation easement be placed on all bypassed areas, preventing PCS from mining any of these areas in the future. Neither of these proposals is practicable and PCS has expressed its disappointment in EPA`s response, particularly given the company`s commitment to environmental stewardship and its track record in this regard.

It is important to note that although some refer to this project as the `largest wetland impact in state history,` what they fail to mention is that the impact will occur over a 35-year period.

In addition, PCS Phosphate mitigates on a 2:1 ratio up front, replacing two wetland acres for every one wetland acre mined, and then reclaims mined land once the mining is complete. Combining the mitigation and reclamation, this will be the largest wetlands restoration in state history, leaving twice as many wetlands and three times as much wildlife habitat as we have today.

As Beaufort County`s largest private employer, with approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 1,000 contractors, and a sound environmental record, it is unbelievable that this company`s license to operate is being put in jeopardy.
Again, I ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Thank you in advance for your consideration on this critical issue to Beaufort County and all of eastern North Carolina.

Sincerely,

As a family member of a PCS employee, I want to offer my sincere thanks to you for your strong support of PCS Phosphate while the company tries to secure the necessary permits that will allow it to continue operating. I also ask that you urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama Administration not to exercise the agency`s veto authority under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act.

Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers informed PCS Phosphate that the Record of Decision (ROD) on the 404 wetlands permit is essentially complete; however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not accepting the ROD. On April 3rd, EPA requested the Assistant Secretary for the Army at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. review the Corps` decision to issue the necessary wetlands permit that will allow the company to continue mining.

In addition, after more than eight years in this permitting process, EPA has proposed yet another boundary change, which represents a significant reduction in potential minable area, adds considerable costs and will cause further delays. EPA also proposes that a conservation easement be placed on all bypassed areas, preventing PCS from mining any of these areas in the future. Neither of these proposals is practicable and PCS has expressed its disappointment in EPA`s response, particularly given the company`s commitment to environmental stewardship and its track record in this regard.

It is important to note that although some refer to this project as the `largest wetland impact in state history,` what they fail to mention is that the impact will occur over a 35-year period.
