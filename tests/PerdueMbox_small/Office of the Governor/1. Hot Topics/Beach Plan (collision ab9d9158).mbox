The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state.

Charlotte, NC 28213-5209 July 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you today to urge you to vote YES on HB1305. Yes, I am an Nationwide Insurance associate; however, I am also a home owner who could be seriously affected in the event that this bill does not pass. This bill will prevent a financial collapse of the Beach Plan. As it stands right now, a major hurricane could bankrupt the severely underfunded Beach Plan, which would leave a potential $6,000,000,000.00 deficit. The result of this? More companies would leave NC and my own - as well as millions of others (yours included) - insurance premiums would skyrocket by up to 200%. And I don't even own beach property!! So again I urge you to please support this bill and vote YES to HB1305 to ensure that the Beach Plan is properly funded so that it can pay its claims, and has a strategy in place to minimize the financial impact of a large storm and preserve competition and the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state.

Subject: my campaign contributions and the beach plan

Comment: Steven Blinsink 114 West A. Street Kannapolis, NC 28081-3206 July 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Thanks for taking the time to hear from me. I support and am a political contributor and supporter. I am proud of our State and her government. I own two businesses, a home, and other property in our home state of North Carolina. I see that other coastal states are behind the curve in dealing with their beach plans. It is time for NC to be a trend setter. We are positioned to start making a difference. Please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Comment: frank hutchinson p o box 310 andrews, NC 28901-0310 July 17, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

As someone whose job is in the insurance industry and a homeowner in the state of NC I believe that without the approval of HB 1305 our state could be in for a troublesome future. A major hurricane could cause to bankruptcy of many insurance companies in NC and cause major rate increases to all North Carolinians homeowners insurance premiums. Please do not let NC end up like states such as FL and LA where obtaining homeowners insurance has become nearly impossible and the choices are limited. Thank you for your time and consideration!

Subject: PLEASE FIX THE BEACH PLAN; SUPPORT H1305

Comment: John Dunn 120 Barrington Drive Mt. Holly, NC 28120-3006 July 18, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support House Bill 1305. The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. To put this into perspective, if this shortfall were covered by state funds, it would equal $1,555 for every taxpayer in North Carolina. House Bill 1305 should stabilize the states coastal insurer by: ensuring that the Beach Plan has the financial resources to pay claims; providing a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm; and preserving competition and availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

The purpose of this bill is to fix the severely under funded Beach Plan, the state-created insurance plan for coastal homeowners. As a widowed and still single woman I am very concerned by this extremely under funded plan. We here in North Carolina cannot afford our insurance as it is..with our economy in the poor shape that it is in. Every day is a struggle. All the jobs lost .No new jobs to find.People losing their homes.Should we buy some food or can we afford it and buy gas to get back and forth to work or the doctor? I'm begging you top please reform the Beach Plan. Help us not have another worry. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims.
