As the daughter of an 86 year old father with swallowing impairments and a 77 year old mother with dementia related cognitive impairments, I have seen strategies implemented from speech-language pathologists help in both of these individuals.  I am also the mother of a 5 year old, that with my early intervention (as an SLP myself), that has overcome a mild articulation impairment and can now be 100% understood by her peers and adults and is a reader ending her kindergarten year. 
As this school year ends, I am getting many notes from parents thanking me, as a preschool therapist. for all the help I have provided in getting their children past many of the errors and delays they had upon entering therapy.  This early intervention is so important for these students.
from infants through geriatrics, speech-language pathologists across settings provide valuable services and your budgets cut will be detrimental to these valuable services.

Dear Representative Frye,

I am a parent of a child with a disability.  In order for him to grow up to be a productive citizen, it is absolutely essential that he receive therapy (speech and occupational therapy, especially).  Even though we homeschool him, he receives therapy at the local elementary school, however, the therapy he receives at school is not enough.  He currently qualifies for, receives, and needs private speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  Because of the therapy he receives, and because I work so hard with him at home, he is currently achieving and retaining knowledge at a faster rate than his normally developing peers.  He will never catch up with his normally developing peers, but he will be able to hold down gainful employment at his current rate of achievement.  If the budget cuts which are being considered by the NC General Assembly are passed, our son will not be able to receive these services through Medicaid and we cannot afford to pay for them privately.  That means our son may not grow up to be a productive, tax-paying citizen.  Please consider the long-term consequences of cutting these necessary (and federally mandated) services.

Another negative consequence is the effect these cuts will have on the therapists and their ability to stay gainfully employed.  I fail to see how putting more people on the unemployment rolls will help our economy.

Respectfully,
Mrs. Kimberly Garland

Dear Governor Purdue,

Thank you for your dedication to the GREAT State of North Carolina.

The NECESSITYof early intervention is well documented.
Studies have shown that if communication disorders are not remediated by 5 years, 6 months this will have an adverse affect on future academic development (Bishop & Adams, 1990). Can the State of North Carolina afford an increased number of children, whose lack of early intervention, places them at risk for school success?

EPSDT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM

* Speech and language intervention is NOT AN OPTIONAL EPSDT service for children 0-21 years.

*Speech and language services are Mandated under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, as a medically necessar service to correctt or ameliorate an illness or condition. Speech and Language Treatment is a medically necessary intervention to correct or ameliorate a physical condition.

*ESPDT mandates supercede the Medicaid State Plan. Please Protect our most valuable assets: The Children of North Carolina. VOTE NO TO EPSDT MASSACRE.  

Who tell the mother of the Child with Down Syndrome, who has begun to talk.......Who will tell the mother of the child with Apraxia of Speech, who is essentially nonverbal......Who will tell the mother of the child w/ Autism Spectrum Disorder, who with continued services will probably be able to function in a regular educational setting.....Who will tell the mother of the child w/craniofacial abnormalities and a hearing impairment, who has begun to use single word utterrances..........and the others. Who will tell these parents  that their child will no longer get the services they need. Who will tell them that the Great State of North Carolina does not value their child's basic need to be able to communicate. Governer Perdue............WHO WILL TELL THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN?????  I will have to be the bearer of the bad news but your term as Governor will always, in the minds of many citizens, be associated with the termination of these medically necessary services.

I do appreciate your dedication to our state.


Sincerely yours,

Nancy D. McCall, MS CCC-SLP

Governor Perdue,

Hi.  My name is Kristen Brown and I am a speech language pathologist for the Onslow County School systems.   I currently work with a varied amount of children in grades K-2.  I recently heard of the proposition that is occurring to cut Medicaid services for all service providers.  As a school speech language pathologist I work with children who ONLY qualify for services in the school system, receive services in the school system and are only able to receive this services due to Medicaid reimbursement. These services are not mundane or unnecessary, most of the SERVICES are MEDICALLY RELEVANT and affect the livelihood in which the child is able to thrive.  I understand that our state is in a major economic crunch and that we need to find ways to sustain our budget but I cannot urge the fact that is budget cut is not an appropriate way to sustain the budget.  With a rate reduction or program reduction not only will the families that I serve be affected, but my family also.  The families that I serve will not be able to receive services for their children if the rates are cut.  Most of these families are working two to three jobs in order to provide homes, food and clothes for their families so they are not able to pay out of pocket for speech services.   I understand the hardships that these families are experiencing.  As my family currently has experienced layoffs, furloughed checks and also pay reductions.  We struggle also to make ends meet and I can't imagine having a child that is not able to eat, communicate his thoughts or wants or even communicate at all and not being able to provide a SERVICE in order to increase the standard of independence in his life.  Our economy is tanking and NC has suffered from the gas prices, job loss, cuts in public education and overall economic hardships. The proposed rate and service reductions will only continue to add to hardships experienced by the families of these special needs children and MY family as well. 

The reductions in the school system have already affected the manner in which I provide services for children.  I have had to increase my group size in order to provide therapy to all the children within the system since we are experiencing a great loss in hiring qualified therapists.  The increase in group size effects the therapy the children receive because of the time constraint and one-to-one attention they would otherwise receive.  In accordance with affecting the families and CHILDREN, the reduction would decrease the effectiveness of our professional workforce and professional revenue by decreasing the local tax base, eliminating jobs, reducing spending in the community, reducing sales tax revenue for the state and increase the number of people on unemployment and state assistance programs.  In other words these types of cuts jeopardize the integrity and stability of North Carolinas economy. I know as your supporter that you will take the time to consider these factors and contemplate the effect these cuts will have in our community and our great state!!!
So in retrospect I beg that you consider this and please Vote No to Budget Reductions/Program Eliminations that DECIMATE Speech Therapy/Audiology benefits for NCs children and adults.  EPSDT makes this illegal for children.



Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) is a federal law under the Social Security Act that protects certain benefits for the Birth-21 year old population.  Speech Therapy and Audiology benefits fall under this protected class. 

EPSDT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM!

As a pediatric and adult service providers I plead that you make other considerations and  VOTE NO to proposed House Budget that DECIMATES federally-mandated EPSDT services for children.

 VOTE NO to proposed House Budget that DECIMATES Speech-Language Pathology/Audiology services for adults. Cutting these services will cause a GREATER ECONOMIC STRAIN on our elderly and advanced care facilities!!

Rep. Dollar,



I voted for you and I am an SLP who lives in Cary and works for Community Partnerships in Raleigh. These cuts would severely inhibit accessibility for children and possibly lead to additional layoffs of myself or other colleagues who serve the birth to 5 population. These early intervention services make a difference and help reduce or eliminate the amount of services these children will need later in elementary school, saving a lot of special education money in the long run! Please try to find other ways to cut the budget that wont hurt our children and cause job loss.

Please help us bring down the proposed House Budget that DECIMATES federally-mandated EPSDT services for children in North Carolina







Dear Senators, Representatives and NC and US government officials:



You have asked us to take part in the creation of a stronger America, and every day the services we provide to North Carolinians aid in our promises to do so. These rights are now in jeopardy

WE NEED YOUR HELP!



We do not believe that by Healthcare for all Americans President Obama intended for our citizens NOT to receive our necessary services.



Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) is a federal law under the Social Security Act that protects certain benefits for the Birth-21 year old population.  Speech Therapy and Audiology benefits fall under this protection.



EPSDT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM!



·       Speech therapy IS NOT AN OPTIONAL EPSDT service for children 0-21 years

·       Speech therapy is MANDATED under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) for children 0-21 years WHEN NECESSARY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE AN ILLNESS OR CONDITION

·       Speech therapy is MEDICALLY NECESSARY to correct or ameliorate a physical condition

·       EPSDT MANDATES SUPERCEDE THE NC MEDICAID STATE PLAN

PROTECT OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS: OUR CHILDREN. VOTE NO TO EPSDT SERVICE ELIMINATION!



**My Name is MaryAnn Kozikowski and I am the HR Director at a pediatric speech therapy company in Greensboro, North Carolina. We are facing a major budget crisis. I am 30 years old and am solely in charge of paying all bills including my mortgage. The proposed cuts will be detrimental to me, my paycheck, my ability to keep a roof over my head, as well as the many families of the children our speech therapists serve every day.

I am a speech-language pathologist who is proud to serve the population that I serve.  I chose this profession because of the impact a speech-language pathologist can make in an individual's life.  Let me explain...My father was in a severe car accident when he was only 35 years old.  He was a very healthy, hard-working individual whose car slid off the road in the pouring down rain on April 26, 1997.  Because of that day, my life was forever changed!  My father had traumatic brain injuries, and several strokes as a result of this car accident.  Our family was devastated when after months of being in a coma we realized he was unable to swallow and unable to communicate with us because of the impact of this incident.  We were so grateful for a team of dedicated speech-language pathologists who worked daily with him and our family in order to give him some sort of independence so that he might be able to enjoy his favorite foods aga! in, and so that he might communicate with us his wants, needs, and desires.  After months of hard work, I'm happy to say that my father did indeed regain his ability to eat his favorite foods, and was able to communicate with us.  For us, even though physically he would not do everything he could prior to the car accident, we had my dad and were so grateful that he was able to communicate and able to still tell us "I love you."  Because I saw the impact speech therapy services can have on an individual and on a family, I chose the profession of speech-language pathology because I'm able to give back to others in the same way others gave of themselves for my family.
I am writing asking you to vote NO to Budget Reductions that Massacre Speech Therapy benefits for NC's children and adults.  I know that the services we provide make a difference and have a significant impact on the populations that we serve.  We work with physicians and other healthcare providers in order to reduce hospitalizations by identifying individuals at risk for aspiration pneumonia, and devising treatment methods therefore decreasing length and recurrence of hospitalizations.  We also provide work to provide communication methods for adults and children who are unable to communicate as a result of a car accident, genetic disorder, developmental delays, strokes, traumatic brain injury, etc.  By giving these individuals a means of communication, we are empowering them to become more independent and decreasing taxpayer dollars needed to care for these individuals.  I'm proud to be a North Carolina citizen, let's keep strong healthcare in NC in! order to care for our citizens.
Sincerely,

Kelly B. Irwin, M.S.

This email is in regard to the upcoming vote on the newly revised, proposed House Appropriations Subcommittee Health and Human Services budget released June 2, 2009.  Please VOTE NO to Budget Reductions/Program Eliminations that DECIMATE Speech Therapy/Audiology benefits for NC's children and adults. EPSDT makes this illegal for children.

As outpatient Speech Therapy providers at Wilson Medical Center, we know that these cuts would have a devastating impact on pediatric and adult clients within our community. We provide articulation, language, and cognitive retraining for children in our community. Many of these children would be unable to communicate basic needs/ideas without speech therapy intervention. Many of these children have diagnoses which require ongoing intensive intervention (i.e., Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Down's Syndrome, Closed head injury, Apraxia of speech, dysphagia). If speech therapy services are reduced, these children will enter school with poor communication and comprehension skills placing them at higher risk of failing grade levels and making them more likely to not complete their high school education.

We also provide communication, cognitive, and swallowing intervention for adults who have suffered stroke, traumatic brain injury, aneurysm,  head and neck cancer, and anoxic brain injuries. Speech therapy intervention for these patients is critical to rehabilitate their ability to understand and communicate with others within their homes, communities, and within society (return to work force). Many of these patients are unable to swallow without food and liquids entering the airway and require feeding tubes. Our goal is to return these patients to eating and drinking safely for removal of the feeding tube. These services are critical in facilitating the patient's community re-entry and return to the work force.

We understand that there is a serious budget crisis in our state; however, rate reductions and program reductions will harm local families, local businesses, and the local economy (tax base). Please VOTE NO to Decimation of SLP/Audiology services.

My name is Beth Griffin and I am a speech pathologist and work for a company called Cheshire Center.  We serve children Birth to 21 in the natural environment, meaning homes, daycare centers and schools.  If this budget goes through, then many of our most needy families in NC will not have access to the services they require to lead healthy, productive lives.  The children we work with are healthier, more ready to learn when they get into school AND cost less money down the road than rehabilitative services, incarceration or school based special education services. Please do not harm the children of NC by allowing these services to be eliminated!!!

Please call me if you want to know more about the services I provide or about how these cute will harm the children of NC

Subject: Vote No to EPSDT Massacre!!!

I am speech language pathologist in Rocky Mount, NC.  I work for a company that provides crucial speech therapy servicesto the birth to 21 population.  The services we provide are federally mandated under the Deficit Act of 2005.  These services are not optional and considered medically necessary.  EPSDT madates supersede the NC Medicaid State Plan!!!  Please do not cut our services from the medicaid program.  Please vote NO to budget reductions that massacre speech therapy benefits for NC's children and adults.  EPSDT makes this illegal!!!  The citizens of NC can come together and temporarily pay more income taxes to avoid making such a devasting and illegal decision.

I know that our state is in a budget crisis; however, eliminating EPSDT services is NOT the solution..  Elimination of this program, and many other services provided by speech-language pathologists and audiologists, will eventually cost more in the long-term than the proposed budget cuts now! Please vote NO to the proposed rate and program reductions that will affect pediatric and adult patients suffering from speech and/or language disorders and/or swallowing problems.

Thank you.

Please help us bring down the proposed House Budget that DECIMATES federally-mandated EPSDT services for children in North Carolina




Dear Senators, Representatives and NC and US government officials:


You have asked us to take part in the creation of a stronger America, and every day the services we provide to North Carolinians aid in our promises to do so. These rights are now in jeopardy

WE NEED YOUR HELP!


We do not believe that by Healthcare for all Americans President Obama intended for our citizens NOT to receive our necessary services.


Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) is a federal law under the Social Security Act that protects certain benefits for the Birth-21 year old population.  Speech Therapy and Audiology benefits fall under this protection.


EPSDT IS NOT AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM!


· Speech therapy IS NOT AN OPTIONAL EPSDT service for children 0-21 years

· Speech therapy is MANDATED under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) for children 0-21 years WHEN NECESSARY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE AN ILLNESS OR CONDITION

· Speech therapy is MEDICALLY NECESSARY to correct or ameliorate a physical condition

· EPSDT MANDATES SUPERCEDE THE NC MEDICAID STATE PLAN

PROTECT OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS: OUR CHILDREN. VOTE NO TO EPSDT SERVICE ELIMINATION!


My Name is Riann Mohar and I am a speech therapist in North Carolina. We are facing a major budget crisis.  The proposed cuts will be detrimental to my family, my paycheck, and my ability to properly provide for my own child and husband, as well as the many families of children we serve every day.  Please do not put thousands of speech therapy and audiology professionals out of jobs and take away the amazing services we provide to children and their families.

As an Early Intervention professional working in the field of developmental disabilities, I kow forst hand how expensive it will be to eliminate services of PT/OT/SP for children determined eligible. Only the most needy get the services, screening and eligibility criteria work.

Mr. Folwell,


My name is Jennifer Lineberry and I am a speech-language pathologist that currently lives and practices in your district. I am writing to convey my deep concerns about the newly released budget reductions involving medicaid. I understand that there is a current budget crisis in the state; however, these drastic budget reductions are not the answer! Not only will these drastic reductions financially devastate local professionals, their families, and local businesses but most importantly it hinders children and adults from receiving services they desperately need.  Please VOTE NO to Decimation of SLP/Aud Services 



Vote No to Budget Reductions/Program Eliminations that DECIMATE Speech Therapy/Audiology benefits for NCs children and adults.  EPSDT makes this illegal for children. Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), federal law under the Social Security Act, protects certain benefits for the Birth-21 year old population.  Speech Therapy and Audiology benefits fall under this protected class.

**Hello, My name is Susan Rachel Smith, my husband and I live in Raleigh. I work for Cheshire Center as a speech-langauge pathologist. We are facing a major budget crisis.  I am the breadwinner in my family because my husband is a graduate student at NC State.  This will directly affect me, my husband, our family and the families that are currently in the process of relocating to North Carolina to come work for my company.

The proposed cuts will be detrimental to my family, my paycheck, my ability to keep a roof over our heads, as well as the many families of children we serve every day.

I can be reached at 919-573-0659 or at <mailto:rkmsmith@gmail.com>rkmsmith@gmail.com .


I can not imagine how putting thousands of therapists out of work and hindering the necessary developmental skills, of 20 times as many children could possibly affect North Carolina for the better.


Please vote NO.

Have a wonderful and blessed day!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am one of your strong supporters from the campaign.  I wrote letters, made phone calls, and canvassed on your behalf.  I want you to know how I feel about funding cuts being proposed in the house. 
The newly revised, proposed House Appropriations Subcommittee Health and Human Services budget released June 2, 2009 includes substantial program reductions for Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology services provided through the North Carolina Medicaid program for both pediatric and adult clients.  These service eliminations decimate the availability of and accessibility to our professional services (plus OT and PT) for NCâs most imperiled and impoverished citizens.   In addition, there are across-the-board provider rate reductions of 6% for all service providers through the Medicaid program.



I am a speech therapist in Durham serving children birth to 21.  Please consider how these reductions will affect my community and my profession. I am writing you to ask you to urge your colleagues in the house to VOTE NO to EPSDT Massacre and VOTE NO to Speech Therapy Program Massacre!!!  These services are essential for my clients!!!  Please consider finding ways to balance the budget that don't take away much needed services from people who really need them!!  I am aware we are in a recession, but cutting these programs is not the way!  Please consider a tax on non-essential items such as cigarettes instead!  Please help your colleagues to understand the devastating effect cutting EPSCT and Speech therapy would be to the communities of North Carolina!!!
Help me to continue to help those in the community who are the least able to speak for themselves!!!!  I'm counting on you!!
Thank you.

Hello, My name is MaryBeth McDermott, my husband and I and our son live in Cary . I work for Cheshire Center as a speech pathologist. My husband is employed by Fidelity Investments in North Carolina . His company has already had 2 layoffs this year. 
This will directly affect me, my husband, our families and the families that I currently service.

I can be reached at 919-362-8798. or at beantown@bellsouth.net<http://us.mc839.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=smeconi@cheshirecenter.net>



I can not imagine how putting thousands of therapists out of work and hindering the necessary developmental skills, of 20 times as many children could possibly affect North Carolina for the better.



Please vote NO.

VOTE NO to proposed House Budget that DECIMATES Speech-Language Pathology/Audiology services for adults.  (You might want to point out that not providing these services in current settings for adult clients will simply lead to greater costs in more advanced care facilities!)
Speech Therapy is absolutely necesary in order to better benefit the lives of individuals who have suffered from deficits impacting their speech/language/cognition/and swallowing. We provide a better quality of life for our patients and help them return to their every day lives. Please consider how much we benefit patients all over and how much we are able to make a difference in their lives in order to better them, their family, and the community.
