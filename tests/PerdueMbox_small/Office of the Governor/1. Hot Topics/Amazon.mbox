Subject: NO NEXUS LAW

Comment: We are writing from the Amazon Associates Program to notify you that your Associates account has been closed as of June 26, 2009. This is a direct result of the unconstitutional tax collection scheme expected to be passed any day now by the North Carolina state legislature (the General Assembly) and signed by the governor. As a result, we will no longer pay any referral fees for customers referred to Amazon.com or Endless.com after June 26. We were forced to take this unfortunate action in anticipation of actual enactment because of uncertainties surrounding the legislation‚Äôs effective date. This is what is going to happen !!!!! If this passes please do not exspect my vote again in 4 yrs. mg

X-Folder: Amazon

Dear Governor Perdue, 
I am a small North Carolina business owner with a website ñ
www.compukiss.com.  I am in strong opposition to Section 27C.2 of SB 202,
which could specify that sales tax is due and to be collected by an online
retailer when the online retailer uses an in state affiliate to sell its
products.

I am opposed to this Section of the bill because it would substantially
harm my small business by reducing a large source of revenue that I rely on
to survive. This revenue results from providing advertising on my website
as part of an ìaffiliateî or ìassociateî program with out-of-state
retailers. 

Several of my retail affiliates have already notified me that if this
legislation passes, they will sever ties with my business causing me a
major loss of income. The result of this legislation is that all of the
out-of-state companies  will sever ties with NC businesses such as mine. So
NC revenues will not be increased and we, the NC small businesses will be
hurt.

For these reasons, I oppose Section 27C.2 of this legislation. Your
response and action to oppose this section is respectfully requested.
Sincerely,

David Berger
Computer Living Corp, a NC business

Dear Gov. Perdue,



The †affiliate nexus legislation that is part of the budget bill will adversely affect NC businesses causing many of us immense financial harm. Several of our affiliates have already our severed relationship in advance of the bill passing. If it passes many more will do the same. NC will not receive any increase in revenue from the passage of this section of the bill. In fact NC may even see a decrease in revenue as businesses like mine will be forced to move out of the stat.



I just wanted you to see this official statement by Governor Schwarzenegger from California as he vetoed the tax increase in California, including the problematic affiliate tax provision. This sums up the adverse affect that this type of legislation would have.

In a statement released by his office last week, Governor Schwarzenegger said ìAfter passing the largest tax increase in California history, it makes absolutely no sense to go back to the taxpayers to solve the current shortfall - thatís why yesterday I vetoed the majority vote tax increase passed by the legislature. With unemployment at an all time high, we should be doing everything we can to keep jobs and create jobs in California. That is why my Administration immediately contacted Overstock.com when we learned of this news and, I am pleased to announce Overstock.com has reversed its decision and will continue to do business with affiliates here in California. I will continue to fight to keep jobs and businesses in California.î

Perhaps this will make other legislators realize the harm that this section (SB 202, Section 27C.2) of the budget bill will cause for NC.

Subject: Q&A About Web Publishing

Comment: Proponents of the ‚Äúaffiliate nexus‚Äù tax (SB 202 Sec. 27c.2) claim that N.C. web publishers who post sponsored ads on their websites constitute a ‚Äúsales force.‚Äù This is NOT accurate. This proposed clause should be modified to clarify that web publishers do NOT create nexus in our state. We are not salespeople. We are editors. We run publications with paid advertising. Magazines and newspapers have paid advertising, yet they are not included in this concept of a ‚Äúsales force.‚Äù Serious analysis and/or litigation will ultimately prove we are not sales people. Meanwhile, if the N.C. legislature passes this law while this issue is still being debated, many many N.C. small businesses and individuals will be severely hurt. We must not have this especially in these hard economic times. Please veto this legislation if it comes to your desk. Here is a Q&A that offers insight on what we do. What is the nature of your business? It's an online publication. What is the purpose of the publication? To provide unique content for visitors interested in publication's topic that they might not be able to find elsewhere. How do your readers find your publication? Through search engines, blogging, and online social networking. Websites that link to my site also provide traffic. How do you generate revenue to operate your publication? Through paid advertising similar to how a magazine generates revenue. How are these ads presented in your publication? Graphic images (banner ads) and text links are placed in areas of the publication specifically designated for advertising. How are you compensated for these ads? Like a magazine or newspaper, I collect a fee for publishing ads. What is your relationship to the businesses who advertise in your publication? I post banner ads or links and the advertiser or its agent pays me. How is the physical location of your publication advantageous to its success? It has no bearing on it. The publication could be located anywhere and it would not affect the content or any advertising placed on it. What type of marketing efforts does your publication pursue to encourage your advertiser's sales to specifically to residents of your state? None. How dependent on sales specifically to residents of your state is your publication? It isn't. What sort of health benefits, retirement plans, or other employment benefits do you receive from the advertiser? None. I am not employed by any of these advertisers. Are you a sales person? No. I am the creative director of an online publication. Sincerely, DD Kenny BizDocuments.com, Inc. 4642 W Market St PMB 343 Greensboro, NC 27407 336-299-5994 ddkenny@bizdocuments.com
