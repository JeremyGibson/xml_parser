Subject: Health Care solution

Comment: RE: Health Care Why don't we agree to increase the entertainment tax, this would be the perfect solution if ticket prices and a higher tax on players and team owners. T The money that is spent on Sports and Entertainment events which is not an essential to a family budget and survival. Even if the ticket price for sport event was increased from a $1.00-.50 cents, on each and every social event, sporting event and an increase taxes on players and owners of teams. I know I can't take a tax increase I'm unemployed and without health insurance, just like everyone else who is making under $20k we can't take another tax increase. Taxing the entertainment market and sport events, seem like a perfect Solution.

It looks like you are the same age as us, so are you willing to have health care plan and be subject to rationing or are you going to have separate health care cuse you are "special" and not like the servants you were elected to serve us. we are your slaves now.

Comment: Governor Perdue: As a Independent I usually vote democrat so I am probably a moderate democrat. Many of us in River Bend are fed up with the national health care proposals in Congress and the Senate. I can assure you that if these bills aren't defeated by those Democrats that are seated, the 2010 election will be a disaster. Many of us have voted and supported you over these many years but if health care reform goes through that will change. I suggest that you pressure the party members and defeat national health care.

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing about President Obama's healthcare proposal. We cannot afford it. Free healthcare is not free. It is paid for by someone, and the someone"S" doing the paying is us, the taxpayers. We'll pay more in taxes for this atrocity that we ever will in medical costs. Can the North Carolina budget afford to pay for Mr. Obama's healthcare program without going into deep debt? I doubt it! Please, if you're a thinking woman, please do all in your power to deep-six this plan and lighten the burden on the taxpayers of North Carolina. Sincerely, Virginia M. Camp New Bern, NC 28562

Subject: healthcare reform

Comment: Governor Perdue, hopefully you agreed with the majority of other governors at the recent Governors' Association meeting this past weekend that the administration's healthcare plan is not feasible, nor well-advised, at this time in our country's economic downturn. The unfunded mandate to increase Medicaid spending would add a significant burden to states who are already struggling. It is remarkable that the stimulus money was used to help most states get through their budget crunches, when in fact most of us believed that stimulus money was intended to "stimulate" the economy with jobs! What does that tell you about the government asking us to continue to spend billions and billions of dollars to enact their agenda? No one questions the need for reform in healthcare. But we absolutely question the wisdom of the current plans being proposed, and we especially question the wisdom of rushing through something this significant just because the Democratic Congress and President Obama wish it so. We will not be held hostage to their timetable. I sincerely ask that you represent all of us in NC by asking tough questions, and making responsible decisions about what you will support in this current climate. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: Health Care Policy

Comment: You may wish to read the July 10, 2009 issue of Medical Economics' article entitled "America's Best Places to Practice (Medicine). Of the top 10 states, NC is not one of them. Criteria used were overall compensation, malpractice insurance rates, cost of doing business, health insurance competition (there is none as NC Blue Cross has been given the green light on all matters by the NC Dept of Insurance while other companies have not), and teh mix of private and government sponsored patients. So, along with many of our baby boomer age MDs retiring, NC is not able to recruit MDs either. If you continue with your support of National Health Insurance legislation and it is approved, there will not be sufficient numbers of doctors to care for those with the new government issued policy. This same issue of Medical Economics describes what happened in Massachusetts when that state legislated a universal health plan....a disaster, as there were not enough doctors to care for the new mass of insured. If you proceed with the many proposed changes in the NC Mediciad program, doctors already overburdened with government and insurance company rules and less pay will either retire or stop caring for Medicaid patients. Visit a primary care doctor's office, review the costs of MDs who must hire staff to help process the paperwork, prior authorizations, claims, fight to get paid, etc and you will have a more complete picture of the reality of medical practice. Thank you for your thoughtful review of my comments.

A complete disdain for the political process. A government of the people? No. An Oligarchy? Yes. The worst in order of priority: Education�most expensive in the world. Also the worst. More expensive each year. Cap and Trade�not settled science. A canard to enable control and taxation. A failure in Europe. A no vote everywhere else. Will stifle small business, the middle class and economic recovery. Government run National Health Care�a sure disaster as proven in Europe and Canada. Cannot afford. Use government to REFORM health care by eliminating barriers that smother competition. Card check�a travesty to American worker/business. Bailouts�Probably unconstitutional. Confiscation of senior debt holders' property and transferring equity to unions�abhorrent. Government sanctioned/mandated closing of dealerships�a disgrace. Stimulus�Anything but�a sure path to inflation and national bankruptcy. Funds allocated are set to be spent during election cycle for political reasons and not now when and where they just MIGHT be effective. Illegal Immigration�Very few in the Congress take their oath of office seriously. An example: uphold the laws�defend the constitution. Another travesty. Breaking the back of middle America.

Subject: health plan/tax

Comment: have just heard the President speak on national television from a hospital. I turned his speech off when he quoted, and I paraphrase, “ER’s have tripled in the number of patients coming in.” I would like the President to next quote the exact percentage of illegal immigrants receiving care via the ER’s across this country. His socialized health plan which will probably cripple this country, would of course PAY for the legalized medical benefits being received by illegal immigrants. I would suggest for starters that Pelosi and the rest of this administration concentrate on enforcement of the immigration laws and they WOULD reduce the ER costs across the board. The President can not today account for the 90 day deadline to control federal spending. Where are the $100 million dollar cuts in administration expense‘s? How can this administration cut 17 billion dollars in the budget next year which was stated when they cannot account for the 100 million in the 90 days? If this administration can not be deliver the 100 million accountability then HOW and WHY should anyone trust the words of this administration when they say they will deliver 17 billion next year? Since the stimulus bill was passed in February, our income has been cut by 15%, first by 10% and last week another 5% in addition to our retirement being suspended, yet we are expected to endorse a health plan created by this administration with Pelosi at the helm. I would be critical of anything this woman has any part of or knowledge in. Frankly, she would better serve the people of this country by resigning instead of waiting for next year’s election. I am convinced that this administration can not do the job at hand and I would feel much better if they would leave it alone until such time other leaders can be elected to fill the task. The February stimulus increased social benefits nearly double, a family I know went from receiving $400.00/mo in food stamps to 800.00/mo in food stamps while I the taxpayer received a 15% decrease in wages and lost our retirement but must pay the federal and state taxes so others that choose not to work can eat from my hard work while I struggle to work and can not even spend half the amount of money in the grocery that my money goes to feed others. This behavior forces on the people a social networking that supports socialism instead of democracy and freedom. At what point does the whole country sign on the social food stamp and Medicaid programs? Is not this health care system being imposed one such move toward this plan? The more I see Pelosi and the more I see the President speak on national television, the more I am convinced this country is TRULY in trouble. The reality is, Democrats are NOT in touch with main stream America. Does this administration think the people are in total darkness? Do they not understand that a lot of Americans know that the top percent of rich will not pay the taxes imposed by this administration? These tax increases will be absorbed by the average American whose income has been reduced as a result of the stimulus passed in February. The cigarette tax will be payed by more Americans of much less income as stated by the President and in addition, cigarettes were already taxed? Where is the ALCOHOL tax? What percentage of American’s will pay the President’s soda - juice- kool-aid tax? This President is demanding action now but the action he is demanding is literally kicking both legs out of the WORKING CLASS AMERICAN. Polls released in the media indicate that 80% percent of Americans are satisfied with their current insurance? WHERE IS THE CRISIS? Why must this health plan be dealt with before the August recess? I would like my leaders to read the plan carefully and critically and also that the plan be made available to the AMERICAN people to be read before our leaders vote on any PLAN. As a Registered Independent female voter, I was willing to give change a chance, I am NOT willing to defend the practices set down by this administration thus far.

I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. You supported a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue and that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts. I am asking you now to stick to your commitment to raising revenue so we can preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. When I think of a North Carolina with educated children, safer streets and healthy communities, I say: "It's worth raising revenue to do that." Thank you. Sincerely, Jolane A. Biever

Comment: I am very concerned about the direction our Federal government is proceeding on many issues. Passing bills without reading them, ie. stimulus, not holding the executive office acoountable, ie czars, promising transparency that has been non existent and now rushing a new national health care program that if not properley studied will have many unintended consequences along with consequences with which I disagree...I noted recently the Governor of Tenn. has taken a position against the Health Care proposal as he feels it will result in Federally unfunded mandates for our state. Make your voice known. Contact our Senators and advise them of risks for the state. I have recently written to Senator Hagan as to my concerns. Should you disagree with me then perhaps you will advise me of your position. By the way untill recently I was a registered Democrat but due to my concern and unfilled promises of change I am now a registed independent. Respectfully Robert Ciurlik

Please do NOT allow abortion to slip scurrilously below the radar and into National Health Reform legislation and thereby escape those who would want an open debate on an issue of the magnitude of abortion funding by tax dollars in this country.

The documented accounts of rationing of medical services, long wait line for diagnosis and then longer wait lines for treatment, and inferior medical care cannot be ignored. In America, while our health care system may not perfect, we are able to choose our doctors, the doctors determine the best course of treatment for their patients, and there is no rationing of medical services. Additionally, in America, uninsured patients cannot be denied treatment in public hospital emergency rooms, so those uninsured patients are able to get the treatment they need in a timely manner. If you insist on voting for government politicians to take over my health care, I implore you to do 4 things:1. Promise and commit to change your health insurance and your immediate family members' health insurance to the new government run program. 2. Promise and sign the pledge to read the bill and allow public input on the final bill for a minimum of 72 hours before voting. 3. Guarantee you will vote against any bill that will lead to rationing of medical services, that will limit in any way the ability for a patient to choose his or her doctor, and that will cause longer wait times before diagnosis and before treatment. 4. Guarantee you will vote against any bill that will increase the cost of medical care through increased taxes, reduced competition of medical providers, reduced competition of private sector health insurance.Will you make these four commitments to your voters and American taxpayers? If you will not make these four commitments, why won't you? What stands in your way of making these promises to insure that the superior medical care in America is not compromised in anyway? Why would you vote for a bill and then be unwilling to live by its consequences as an example to your constituents? Please answer these questions in a return mailing to me. I eagerly await your reply as the future of my physical well being now seems to be in your hands. I strongly suggest that you START voting the people's wishes and STOP voting your party if you would like to continue in the office for which the people of NC voted. Thank you!

Subject: Health Care Reform

Comment: I am deeply concerned about the proposed health care bill. I oppose any form of universal government health care. We cannot afford this costly program and we will bankrupt our country. We do need reform health care but I believe that we should reform the way the present insurance companies do business. Health care should be left to private insurers, NOT government! Medicare even outsourses it's billing to private insurance. This government program cannot even manage it's own affairs. We need to stop fraud, waste and abuse within our present systems for medicare and medicaid. Where do you stand on this issue?

Subject: Carry Permit

Comment: Thank you, Governor Perdue, for signing House Bill 1132. As a new permit holder, I have been concerned with our 2nd amendment rights to protect our families in these troubled economic times. I am 43 years old and until lately had never even considered owning a handgun. Now that I do, I am glad to know that my Governor supports our Constitutional rights. Also, I work in a hospital as an engineer and Safety Officer. Please use the powers that you have to ensure that our healthcare system is protected in a menner that will allow our hospitals to continue to operate for the safety and wellfare of our patients and not have to close due to Washington D.C. bureaucracy. Thank you again, T. Scott Bland

Subject: Health care Bill

Comment: This bill is going to be a catastrophe to the people of the United States of America. This bill has not been read by any Senator or Governor and should not be passed. The state of North Carolina will have to pick up the tab for this after a few years as will all the other states. We the taxpayers cannot afford to do this on the whim of a President who has overspent and will cost my children and my grand children in years to come. SAY NO TO THIS BILL.

Subject: Teacher Pay concerns

Comment: Dear Governor, I am writing with great concern. If teacher pay is cut 10%, health insurance is raised, we have to add dental and eye policies, as this is no longer covered, I calculated $700 at least of my pay being cut. I now have to do debt management help to stay afloat. I teach in Concord, and travel from Statesville, where I live with my mother since my father's death. I cannot transfer to Iredell schools and now can't afford to move to Concord, so I continue to commute. Teacher position have been frozen.I will soon need a new car, but can't figure that into the pay now as I had planned, so basically the incompetence of the government has taken what was already difficult for me as a single parent, and made it virtually impossible. I am looking for a second job, which I do not have the energy for, and am told due to the teering of buses that school will have an earlier start, a 45 minute longer teaching day, less pay and we will be responsible for extra planning for the non-speaking students etc, with additional SIOP lesson plans. When did it become legal to pay less, make someone work more hours, and give them a heavier work load.. than say we are lucky to have a job, as we contact debt management just to stay afloat? I am so angry at this situation. It was tight before, but I feel totally defeated. My pay will return to the scale I had when I started 20 years ago! Tough on motivation. Please respond, as I feel like all that I have tried to accomplish in my teaching career is in vain.

Subject: Health Care Reform

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue: I am one of your constituents and I just wanted to let you know how I feel about the nationalized health care program that is being discussed in Congress right now. The system that we currently have in place is sorely inadequate. But the plan for socialized medicine that is being discussed scares me to death! I am 48 y.o. and I have diabetes. My husband has a rare genetic disorder. I understand that the proposed bill would not cover people with incurable diseases. Both my husband and I have been active, contributing members of society for many, many years. We are hard-working Americans who DESERVE OPTIONS for health care. We have a great dr. who helps us in making informed decisions about our health care. Also, I understand that the plan being discussed in the House will take millions away from senior citizens, those who deserve it the most. PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! As this bill is discussed, encourage our President, Congressmen and women, to take their time and consider this extremely important decision. PLEASE do not give decision-making power to the federal govt. PLEASE! Keep it in the hands of dr.s and patients. I hope that any program that you agree to for America, you will feel comfortable in having your family enrolled. Thank you for ANY thing you can do to protect us from socialized medicine. Thank you. Diane Bero Durham, NC

I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. You supported a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue and that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts. I am asking you now to stick to your commitment to raising revenue so we can preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. When I think of a North Carolina with educated children, safer streets and healthy communities, I say: "It's worth raising revenue to do that." Thank you. Sincerely, Suzannah Tebbe Davis 828-298-9623
