Subject: NEW NC SMOKING BAN LAW

Comment: THIS LAW IS VERY CONFUSING TO ME. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE AND PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS NEW LAW APPLIES TO ME. I OWN A PRIVATE CLUB, 21 YEARS AND UP, THAT IS MAINTAINED BY SELECTIVE MEMBERS, OPERATED BY THE MEMBERS, & WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOOD OR LODGING FOR PAY TO NON MEMBERS. THE ONLY THING IS THAT WE ARE NOT A NON-PROFIT CORPORATION. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE STATES SANITATION LAWS OR HAVE A PERMIT BECAUSE WE ARE A PRIVATE CLUB. EVEN THOUGH WE MEET ALL REQUIREMENTS TO BE EXEMPT FROM THIS LAW DOES THIS STILL MEEN THAT THE LAW APPLIES TO US JUST BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION? IN THE LAW IT ALSO STATES THAT BEVERAGES ONLY PLACES THAT USE SINGLE SERVICE CONTAINERS, INWHICH WE DO, THAT ARE NOT MADE FROM RAW FRUITS OR VEGIES, WHICH THEY ARE NOT, WE COULD ALSO FALL UNDER THIS SECTION. PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP BECAUSE THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF PUTTING FOOD ON MY TABLE FOR MY FAMILY AND A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS! I KNOW THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT IS STATED ABOVE, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO CONTACT. IF THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO CONTACT PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTACT ME. CELL NUMBER:(919)691-3260 CALL AT ANY TIME!!!!
