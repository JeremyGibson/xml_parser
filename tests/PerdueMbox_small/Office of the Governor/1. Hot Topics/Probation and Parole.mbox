Dear Gov. Perdue

Your actions are long overdue for the Probation and Parole Department.  In my 40 years of Law Enforcement, Federal Employment, and now Corporate Security this is the most hated Department to deal with.  Not only are the employees ignorant of the law, their supervisors are arrogant and obnoxious to deal with.  I speak from first hand knowledge and personal conversations with these employees. Criminals are allowed to walk in and out of Probation offices while known warrants are outstanding.  Again, I speak from first hand knowledge.  I would suggest that this Department learn to interact with the public and become knowledgeable of the law.  I would welcome any opportunity to discuss our particular problems with someone that has knowledge of the law as well as an open mind for constructive criticism.

I support most of the probation reforms but have serious reservations about the items listed below...

> - Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;
- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;
- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

It has been my experience that law enforcement does a poor job of limiting themselves when it comes to somebody's civil rights, so these povisions need to be monitored VERY CLOSELY for officers that cross the line.  Please consider this in the future.

Gov. Perdue's Probabtion Reforms to Improve Public Safety

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced significant reforms to the probation system that will speed the process of obtaining warrants for parole commission violators and put more information into the hands of law enforcement officers on the streets.

These reforms include the following changes:

- The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission will respond to requests for warrants within 24 hours;

- Probation officers will receive a response to a violation report within that same 24 hours;

- If a warrant is issued it will be entered into the DCI network immediately; and

- Law enforcement officers across North Carolina will have immediate access to information about probationers and prison inmates on their vehicle computers whenever a license check is conducted.

In addition, the governor signed Senate Bill 920, her proposal to:

- Allow probation officers the authority to perform warrantless searches on supervised probationers;

- Give law enforcement officers the ability to perform warrantless searches if they have reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity or possesses a weapon without written court permission;

- Allow probation officers limited access to juvenile criminal records, providing them with better insight into the risks offenders pose;

“With these changes, law enforcement and probation officers will have immediate access to probation information and will be better prepared to protect themselves and their communities,” Perdue said. “These reforms will strengthen our probation system and make our communities safer.

“This kind of access to information is crucial for the safety of our officers, our law enforcement partners and the public,” said Correction Secretary Alvin Keller.  “No longer will probation violators be able to hide from the system.”

Also, Governor Perdue announced that information from the Department of Correction offender database of more than 1.1 million criminal offenders is being shared with the law enforcement community via the DCI network.

Since the computer system for law enforcement vehicles was activated on June 24, officers have entered roughly 128,000 queries, and 1,146 probation absconders have been arrested.

Gov. Perdue Signs Bill Establishing Stricter Safety Oversight of Coal Ash Ponds

Gov. Perdue today signed Senate Bill 1004, increasing the safety oversight of coal ash ponds in North Carolina. The legislation subjects dams that create coal ash ponds to direct inspection by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 

“Because of potential risk posed by the location of North Carolina’s coal ash ponds, we must provide greater oversight and more frequent inspections,” said Gov. Perdue. “This legislation will keep our citizens safer and our dams more secure.”

In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a list of 44 “high-hazard” coal ash waste dams across the county. Twelve of these dams were located in North Carolina, more than any other state. A “high hazard” designation was created in the 1980’s for coal ash impoundments and other similar dams that are near densely populated areas, downstream water supplies, important public utilities or primary highways because of the potential impact of a dam’s failure.  The designation does not reflect the structural condition of the dam. 

Currently, power companies are only required to file reports every five years by private engineers on the structural conditions of the dams.  The reports are filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission and the impoundments are exempt from regulation under the N.C. Dam Safety Act.

This legislation, sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle (D-Guilford) and led by Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) in the House, places coal ash dams and ponds under the regulation of the Dam Safety Act. This means the structures will be more closely regulated, and requires a state inspection every two years. 

15 Contracts Totaling More Than $29 Million Awarded for Highway Projects Across NC

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced that 15 contracts totaling $29.3 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including seven projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

“These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and maintaining jobs as we enhance safety and keep our people traveling,” Perdue said.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

NC Submits Grant Application for Economic Recovery Funding for I-85 Improvement Project

North Carolina has submitted a grant application for $300 million in discretionary grant money included in the ARRA to use for the I-85 Corridor Improvement Project, which includes replacing the I-85 bridge over the Yadkin River, in Davidson and Rowan counties. Comprehensive information about the project is available on a new Web site, <http://www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/>www.ncdot.gov/recovery/i85corridor/.

“Replacing this bridge is critical to preserving safety, travel and commerce along this vital interstate route and is an ideal candidate for recovery funding,” Perdue said. “These improvements are essential to ensuring that I-85 continues to move people and goods safely and effectively on a regional, statewide and national level.”

Perdue has been working with Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to obtain funding for the project. It also has received tremendous support from local communities and business leaders advocating for the project. Nearly 100 letters and resolutions of endorsement have been received to date and can be viewed on the project Web site.

The I-85 Corridor Improvement Project will complete a comprehensive overhaul of the highway, bridge and rail infrastructure located along 6.8 miles of I-85 from north of Long Ferry Road (Exit 81) in Rowan County to U.S. 29-52-70/I-85 Business (Exit 87) in Davidson County. The project would be completed under two design-build contracts, which allow project teams of designers and contractors to conduct design and construction work simultaneously to expedite completion, at an estimated cost of more than $300 million.

I-85 is the most direct and heavily traveled route between Richmond and Atlanta. The stretch of highway included in this project currently carries nearly 70,000 vehicles per day, with traffic counts projected to more than double by 2030. Trucks account for 26 percent of the traffic along this portion of I-85.

Right now, this stretch has only two lanes in each direction, with narrow shoulders, sharp curves and closely spaced interchanges. The existing I-85 Yadkin River Bridge is outdated and narrow and is currently rated in poor condition and classified as both structurally deficient (having elements that need to be monitored and/or repaired) and functionally obsolete (outdated in design).

The total crash rate for this portion of I-85 is about 77 percent higher than the average crash rate for comparable roadways across the state, while the fatal crash rate is 80 percent higher.

The project is expected to reduce crash rates by 75 percent and improve traffic flow by alleviating existing bottlenecks. Improvements to the railroad tracks that cross under I-85 will increase track speed by 45 percent and accommodate future rail needs, including the implementation of high-speed rail.

from an economic standpoint, the project has the potential to create or sustain more than 7,000 jobs, and it is expected to result in economic benefits 12 to 17 times its cost. This stretch of I-85 is in a region of the state that has been hard-hit by job losses, with both Davidson and Rowan counties qualifying as economically distressed areas under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.

Gov. Perdue Joins Statewide Health Leaders at President's Town Hall

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wednesday joined health leaders from across North Carolina to attend President Barack Obama’s health care forum at Broughton High School in Raleigh. The governor invited representatives from the state’s leading health care organizations, including hospitals, research institutions, advocates and minority groups, to attend the event with her.

“I applaud the president for prioritizing health care and for working with Congress to bring about change,” Perdue said. “Here in North Carolina, one in five of our citizens does not have health insurance. We are living the problem, and we are all anxious for a solution.

“When I spoke to President Obama this morning, I told him I believe strongly that reform must take place at the federal level.  We have innovative solutions to providing care in North Carolina, and we have excellent providers, but our finances are stretched to the limit.  We must ensure that the financial burden of a new system cannot fall to the states.  A national health care system must provide the right care, at the right time, at the right place – but at a price that people, and states, can afford.”
