Subject: Farm Workers' Rights Now!

Comment: Collette Rutherford 4660 Tournament Drive, Apt. 306 Raleigh, NC 27612-2594 November 19, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing on behalf of farm workers like Salvador Solis who are fighting for their right to be treated just like workers in every other industry. He says, "We are made of flesh and blood, just like everyone else. We work hard. We have families. We have dreams of a better future. We deserve to have a day of rest, to be paid overtime and to join a union if we choose just like everyone else." Under current law, farm workers are denied: * Overtime pay provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). * The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA (on farms that employ fewer than seven workers). * The child labor protections of the FLSA. The law's protections against the hazards of students working in shopping malls are stronger than the protections against children working in agriculture where toxic pesticides, heavy machinery and other hazards threaten their future. * The right to join labor unions and bargain collectively. Please do your best to right this wrong by supporting legislation that would remove exemptions for agriculture from the labor laws. Sincerely, Collette Rutherford 9195391060
