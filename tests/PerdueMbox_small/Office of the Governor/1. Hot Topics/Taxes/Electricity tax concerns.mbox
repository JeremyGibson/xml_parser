Subject: No New taxes on Electricity

Comment: Patricia Walter 408 Summertree Ct Winston Salem, NC 27127-6768 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I urge you to hold the line on taxes and reject calls to enact higher taxes on electric power. The problem in North Carolina is not that electric power is too cheap but that government spends too much. The State budget should not be balanced on the backs of those who pay power bills. Stop wasteful spending. Drill off the coast for oil. Think outside the tax hike box!! Sincerely, Patricia Walter

Subject: Stop the Tax Hike on Power

Comment: Jeffrey King 3114 Williams Station Road Matthews, NC 28105-1272 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I urge you to hold the line on taxes and reject calls to enact higher taxes on electric power. I am concerned that lawmakers are considering higher taxes on my home power bill.�I understand one proposal being discussed is increasing the sales tax on electricity from 3 percent to 6.75 percent. The new tax on electric power would single out residential customers and small business because many big businesses are exempt from taxes on electric power. With hot July temperatures it is already expensive enough to cool my home. This new tax would be a huge unfair burden on me and my family. The problem in North Carolina is not that electric power is too cheap, is that government spends too much. The State budget should not be balanced on the backs of those who pay power bills. If I go over my personal budget, I can't demand a pay raise from my employer--I have to cut back on spending . . . and North Carolina should do the same!! Sincerely, Jeffrey King

Please, do the right thing for this state. Don't drive us in to the ground like the Federal Gov't. is doing. As a democrat, you say that you are looking out for the little guy - well by raising taxes on our energy bills you are going to be HURTING not just us "little guys" but everyone. I have to balance my budget every month on my husbands income and I do it every time. Why not have NC try that instead of raising our taxes. History shows that by raising taxes you will receive LESS revenue. I already am cutting back so much, I can't imagine what else I"ll have to cut back on if I have to pay MORE for my energy bills. If you DO allow this to pass, The next time you go into your nice cool office that my tax dollars are paying for and think about my 4 sweet daughters and me at home with our A/C OFF just so we can BALANCE our OWN budget. HMMM. Doesn't sound quite "Fair" to me, does it. Sincerely, Casey Van Buskirk 3367122850

I would like for you to consider an alternative to taxing the people of North Carolina. Those of us who work hard and pay taxes are almost taxed out. Our salaries are down, our expenses are up, and adding unnecessary taxes will be a major financial burden to us. I would rather see the pork cut out of the spending than to raise taxes. Leave education alone. Cut in other places where it doesn't affect the education of our future leaders. Please consider the undue burden the proposed taxes, whether it be electrical, gas, or service, will put on the few of us who work hard for our money and those of us who own small businesses. Thank you for listening to my concerns. Sincerely, Kacey Matheson 9109973004

Subject: Stop the Tax Hike on Power

Comment: Kathy Hankard 1103 South Topsail Drive Surf City, NC 28445-6763 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I urge you to hold the line on taxes and reject calls to enact higher taxes on electric power. I am concerned that lawmakers are considering higher taxes on my home power bill.�I understand one proposal being discussed is increasing the sales tax on electricity from 3 percent to 6.75 percent. The new tax on electric power would single out residential customers and small business because many big businesses are exempt from taxes on electric power. With hot July temperatures it is already expensive enough to cool my home. This new tax would be a huge unfair burden on me and my family. The problem in North Carolina is not that electric power is too cheap, is that government spends too much. The State budget should not be balanced on the backs of those who pay power bills.

This is an outrageous tax on all of the state's residents but especially homeowners and small businesses. If the state would cut back on spending, maybe it wouldn't be necessary to look for more and more ways to raise taxes. Unlike taxes on luxury items, a tax on power is unavoidable. Rethink this one, please. For those who are holding the line in the budget wars, thank you. For those who keep looking for more and more ways to sock it to the consumer, and we are all consumers, cut spending first. Sincerely, Flora M. Smith 336-629-4438

That is a huge savings for using a program with excellent outcomes. Tax payers cannot foot the entire deficit. Sincerely, Carol Taylor

You people really don't seem to get it....you are not only destoying the state, but lives as well...I know that I won't remain in this state much longer if your "tax strategies" continue on their current path...and I am not alone in this way of thinking.

I make a modest salary and really need my taxes reduced rather than increased at the same time gas and food prices are increasing. Find somewhere else to cut. You can start by simplifying the design of the schools here in Wake County. Our children don't need palaces for schools. They need teachers and parents who care about them. Sincerely, Bill Denton

We moved to North Carolina to escape the tax and spend mentality up north. We will move again if NC continues this practice. Further, the more you tax the items we need to just survive, we will have to become more conservative in our use of electricity. So in the long run, you will get a larger percentage of less priciple.

Comment: Mike Brewer Sr 464 Autumn Leaf Rd Troutman, NC 28166-8643 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I urge you to hold the line on taxes and reject calls to enact higher taxes on electric power. I am concerned that lawmakers are considering higher taxes on my home power bill.�I understand one proposal being discussed is increasing the sales tax on electricity from 3 percent to 6.75 percent. The new tax on electric power would single out residential customers and small business because many big businesses are exempt from taxes on electric power. With hot July temperatures it is already expensive enough to cool my home. This new tax would be a huge unfair burden on me and my family. The problem in North Carolina is not that electric power is too cheap, is that government spends too much. The State budget should not be balanced on the backs of those who pay power bills.

The new tax on electric power would single out residential customers and small business because many big businesses are exempt from taxes on electric power. With coming potential increases in income tax, sales tax, taxes on services, etc.. the last thing we need is an increase in energy taxes. More and more money is being taken from out pockets leaving less and less for discretionary spending. My May power bill was the higher than any summer month from last year. With hot July temperatures predicted, it is already expensive enough to cool my home. This new tax would be a huge unfair burden on me and my family.

John F. Kennedy put it as well as anyone has every done, "Ask not what your country (state) can do for you, ask what you can do for your country (state)." Let's reel government back in to do what it is supposed to do and quit trying to be all for everyone. If the people want it for free, tell them that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If they are welfare recepients, make them workfare recepients. Let's start running government as a business, not a bottomless pot of gold for everyone with a hand out. If they want something bad enough, tell them to go work for it and don't expect the government to get it for them.

Comment: David Leonard 5900 Sapp Road Rockwell, NC 28138-8679 July 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a member of Americans for Prosperity-North Carolina, I urge you to hold the line on taxes and reject calls to enact higher taxes on electric power. The new tax on electric power would single out residential customers and small business because many big businesses are exempt from taxes on electric power. With hot July temperatures it is already expensive enough to cool my home. This new tax would be a huge unfair burden on me and my family. The problem in North Carolina is not that electric power is too cheap, is that government spends too much. The State budget should not be balanced on the backs of those who pay power bills. Sincerely, David S Leonard and family 000-000-0000
