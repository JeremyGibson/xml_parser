ARDEN-ASHEVILLE AREA MINI-STORAGE

7 NEW ROCKWOOD ROAD

ARDEN, N. C. 28704



Dear GOVERNER,



As a constituent and a small business [insert owner, employee or customer], I am writing to urge you to vote no on imposing a sales tax on self storage rentals. Sales tax on self storage is a bad policy for many reasons. Applying a sales tax to self storage rents would add another tax burden on the most vulnerable members of the community: low and moderate income households, families needing storage due to difficult relocations (involving foreclosures, lost jobs, divorce, death, etc.), active military, single-parent households, retirees, students, and small business owners. These are the people who use and operate self storage facilities. Imposing a sales tax on self storage rent would tax the very citizens that the government should be striving to protect.



Legislators should also be aware that goods in self storage units generally were subject to sales tax when purchased, and may be family possessions handed down from generation-to-generation. Indirectly taxing those goods over and over again by taxing the monthly rent paid to store the items seems unfair, particularly when no such sales tax would apply to those keeping similar items in larger offices or those with storage space in their homes.



Similarly, self storage rent should not be treated differently for sales tax purposes than is rent from other real estate. Just as there is no justification to applying the sales tax to rent paid for an apartment or an office, there is no logic to applying the sales tax to rent paid to store belongings that will not fit into a tenant’s apartment, home or office.



We are sympathetic to the current fiscal difficulties that almost everyone faces and we strongly urge you to consider the many adverse effects of imposing sales taxes on self storage unit leases, and to reject such an unfair approach. It seems clearly wrong to try to reduce a governmental deficit by pushing an inequitable sacrifice onto low and moderate income self storage customers, those needing storage during difficult personal transition periods and small business operators of only this particular type of rental real estate.



Thank you for you time and consideration.



Sincerely,



W. C. LISENBEE, PRES.

Governor,



If the Governor’s office is anything like most Democrat responses, people who have real concerns and who really are the “taxbase” don’t get responses because we expect honesty, decency, and a realistic running of our government, just like we have to with our businesses and jobs to make ends meet. But Government seems to know better and continues to fail at what they do because they apply politics and self-interests instead of good common sense in running the government. How about putting the people, the small businesses and the taxpayer of this country first? Try finding ways to insure they remain viable, because at this rate, you are “strangling” the lifeblood of most people and businesses, and this country is spiraling downward at unprecedented rates. What ever happened to an honest days work for an honest days wage, starting with the top!!!!



Thanks,



Kenny Zwahr

If the legislature adopts the House proposal to create a new 8.25 percent income tax rate on individuals making between $120,000 and $300,000 a year and an 8.5 percent rate on individuals making more than $300,000, North Carolina would join only a handful of states ï¿½ California, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia ï¿½ with similarly high income taxes. Many small business pay taxes at the individual rate, and this plan would directly lead to job losses. The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy.

Many small business pay taxes at the individual rate, and this plan would directly lead to job losses. The two new personal income tax brackets included in the N.C.

The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy. In addition to the lost private-sector jobs, the income tax increases would reduce North Carolinians' real after-tax income by $101 million, cut the Gross State Product by almost $36 million, and cost local governments $12 million in tax revenue. That's according to the analysis from economists at the Beacon Hill Institute, the research arm of the economics department at Bostonï¿½s Suffolk University. According to the report, the income tax increases would destroy 2,817 private sector jobs, shrink the stateï¿½s economy by $36 million, drain $101 million in real disposable income from citizens,take $12 million from local governments, and bring in $40 million less than budget writers claim. I also want you to personally know, that I do not buy the rhetoric that these tax increases on income, are only paid by the rich. I fully understand how they will hurt all North Carolina citizens, because of a loss of jobs and a severe loss of private sector investment in job creation. Sincerely, Scott Blunck 704-254-5424

If the legislature adopts the House proposal to create a new 8.25 percent income tax rate on individuals making between $120,000 and $300,000 a year and an 8.5 percent rate on individuals making more than $300,000, North Carolina would join only a handful of states ï¿½ California, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia ï¿½ with similarly high income taxes. Many small business pay taxes at the individual rate, and this plan would directly lead to job losses. The two new personal income tax brackets included in the N.C. House budget could "destroy" more than 2,800 private-sector jobs in the state, according to a report from Boston-based economists who analyzed the tax plan. The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy. In addition to the lost private-sector jobs, the income tax increases would reduce North Carolinians' real after-tax income by $101 million, cut the Gross State Product by almost $36 million, and cost local governments $12 million in tax revenue. That's according to the analysis from economists at the Beacon Hill Institute, the research arm of the economics department at Bostonï¿½s Suffolk University. According to the report, the income tax increases would destroy 2,817 private sector jobs, shrink the stateï¿½s economy by $36 million, drain $101 million in real disposable income from citizens,take $12 million from local governments, and bring in $40 million less than budget writers claim. I also want you to personally know, that I do not buy the rhetoric that these tax increases on income, are only paid by the rich. I fully understand how they will hurt all North Carolina citizens, because of a loss of jobs and a severe loss of private sector investment in job creation. Sincerely, Virginia Quaglia 910-575-4921

Clemmons, NC 27012-8609 July 9, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: As a North Carolina taxpayer, I am concerned that the massive increase in state income taxes proposed by the North Carolina House of Representatives will lead to job losses and a loss of Prosperity for North Carolina. Many small business pay taxes at the individual rate, and this plan would directly lead to job losses. The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy. In addition to the lost private-sector jobs, the income tax increases would reduce North Carolinians' real after-tax income by $101 million, cut the Gross State Product by almost $36 million, and cost local governments $12 million in tax revenue. That's according to the analysis from economists at the Beacon Hill Institute, the research arm of the economics department at Bostonï¿½s Suffolk University. According to the report, the income tax increases would destroy 2,817 private sector jobs, shrink the stateï¿½s economy by $36 million, drain $101 million in real disposable income from citizens,take $12 million from local governments, and bring in $40 million less than budget writers claim. I also want you to personally know, that I do not buy the rhetoric that these tax increases on income, are only paid by the rich. I fully understand how they will hurt all North Carolina citizens, because of a loss of jobs and a severe loss of private sector investment in job creation. Sincerely, Kay Marion 336-766-5434

If the legislature adopts the House proposal to create a new 8.25 percent income tax rate on individuals making between $120,000 and $300,000 a year and an 8.5 percent rate on individuals making more than $300,000, North Carolina would join only a handful of states California, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia with similarly high income taxes.

I work in the Transportation industry, and daily I am faced with closing business, this would hurt our state,jobs and our people. We may want to look at decreasing our government. Less can be more. Let north carolina be the first to flat tax on commodities, this would put revenues back in our state and to our people. Be a leader and Create jobs not kill jobs and increase our already 11.1 % unemployement rate. Stop big bonus, for leaders who are driving there companies in to the hole. Reward those who help by for your job and stop punishing them. I think every american should alter their tax bracket where the get the majority of their paycheck,( like those claiming 10 childern and have non) they pay nothing in our system and take all. once we get to the point all americans pay little tax to our govment and more in our pocket. our government may realize who and just how many pay these taxes.

We arrest cars salesmen for this kind bait and switch tactic. We are fed up with your dis honest tactics period. Our families will continue to cut back spend less and prepare for the worst. Our only hope is that your irrespnsibility comes full circle and you are held accontable. PS maybe you should read the Bills before voting on it. It would seem as though voting for a bill before it is written makes it unconstitiutional. Lets wait and see. Sincerely, Tim Genest

If the legislature adopts the House proposal to create a new 8.25 percent income tax rate on individuals making between $120,000 and $300,000 a year and an 8.5 percent rate on individuals making more than $300,000, North Carolina would join only a handful of states ï¿½ California, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia ï¿½ with similarly high income taxes. The two new personal income tax brackets included in the N.C. House budget could "destroy" more than 2,800 private-sector jobs in the state, according to a report from Boston-based economists who analyzed the tax plan. The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy. In addition to the lost private-sector jobs, the income tax increases would reduce North Carolinians' real after-tax income by $101 million, cut the Gross State Product by almost $36 million, and cost local governments $12 million in tax revenue. That's according to the analysis from economists at the Beacon Hill Institute, the research arm of the economics department at Bostonï¿½s Suffolk University. According to the report, the income tax increases would destroy 2,817 private sector jobs, shrink the stateï¿½s economy by $36 million, drain $101 million in real disposable income from citizens,take $12 million from local governments, and bring in $40 million less than budget writers claim. I also want you to personally know, that I do not buy the rhetoric that these tax increases on income, are only paid by the rich. I fully understand how they will hurt all North Carolina citizens, because of a loss of jobs and a severe loss of private sector investment in job creation.

Stop punishing achievers. Stop redistributing wealth. People that earn more work harder, take risks, make sacrifices and better decisions. Why should they supplement those that don't? If there was a flat state income tax, those that earn more would pay more. Why punish them even greater? One of the main reasons I moved to NC from NY was taxes. Stop the unfairness, redistribution of wealth is unfair and results in nothing positive.

If the legislature adopts the House proposal to create a new 8.25 percent income tax rate on individuals making between $120,000 and $300,000 a year and an 8.5 percent rate on individuals making more than $300,000, North Carolina would join only a handful of states ï¿½ California, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia ï¿½ with similarly high income taxes. Many small business pay taxes at the individual rate, and this plan would directly lead to job losses. The two new personal income tax brackets included in the N.C. House budget could "destroy" more than 2,800 private-sector jobs in the state, according to a report from Boston-based economists who analyzed the tax plan. The state already has the 11.1 percent unemployment -- and it would be dangerous for lawmakers to consider a tax increase that would do this much damage to the state's slumping economy. In addition to the lost private-sector jobs, the income tax increases would reduce North Carolinians' real after-tax income by $101 million, cut the Gross State Product by almost $36 million, and cost local governments $12 million in tax revenue. That's according to the analysis from economists at the Beacon Hill Institute, the research arm of the economics department at Bostonï¿½s Suffolk University. According to the report, the income tax increases would destroy 2,817 private sector jobs, shrink the stateï¿½s economy by $36 million, drain $101 million in real disposable income from citizens,take $12 million from local governments, and bring in $40 million less than budget writers claim. I also want you to personally know, that I do not buy the rhetoric that these tax increases on income, are only paid by the rich. I fully understand how they will hurt all North Carolina citizens, because of a loss of jobs and a severe loss of private sector investment in job creation. Sincerely, John C. Rogers, III 919-510-8715
