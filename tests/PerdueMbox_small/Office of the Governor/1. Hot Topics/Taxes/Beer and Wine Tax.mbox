Governor Perdue,
Now is not the time to raise the Beer and Wine tax.  With your sales tax
proposal this is a double dip singling out the alcohol industry that will
cost jobs and have a direct adverse affect on the working class.  Beer is
the societies lubricant!

Cheers,
Jeff

Dear Governor Perdue,

In light of the ongoing economic crisis, do you really think it wise to increase taxes on any commodity?
In my humble opinion this is truely shortsighted. Please follow my logic. If we increase taxes on beer and wine will that not take money out of the people's pocket that help drive the economy thus worsening the ongoing crisis? The same reasoning applies to any tax increase it takes money out of private hands that keep investments in job growth at a stand still and puts it into the public officials the really cannot manage it wisely and historically never has been managed wisely.

Dear Governor,
I'm writing you to express my concern over the proposed tax increase on wine. Currently wine sales in North Carolina are trending -6% year-to-date as a category. In addition, fine wine (costing $15 or above) is trending down -23% year-to-date. Wine sales have taken a beating in this recession and we ask that you not raise the tax on this category. Jobs are at stake and your consideration to oppose a wine tax increase would be greatly appreciated.

Email: captfil@yahoo.com

Subject: Please do not raise my taxes

Comment: Fil Pagano PO Box 145 Beaufort, NC 28516-0145 July 10, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Dear North Carolina legislator, This is not the time to raise taxes in anyway I understand it is hard to write a budget this year because the state is not collecting the taxes it expected. Please do not make it easier on yourself by passing a spend-and-tax budget that makes it harder for my family to make ends meet. Higher taxes would slow our economic recovery and cause more hardships for the 11 percent of people without a job. In 1991 and 2001, your colleagues and predecessors raised taxes to pay for spending programs taxpayers could no longer afford. As a result, North Carolina now has the twentieth highest tax burden in the country, and one of the highest in the South. We have one of the highest income tax rates in the country, and it starts at a lower level of income than most states. We also have the highest corporate income tax rate in the Southeast. The spending and tax plans presented by Gov. Perdue and Senate Democrats would repeat the pattern with up to $1 per pack more for cigarettes, a 280 percent increase in taxes on other kinds of tobacco, higher taxes on beer and alcohol, higher and more complicated income taxes, higher taxes for businesses, and a new six-percent sales tax on everything I do online, plus home repairs, car repairs, extended warranties, or even a haircut. For those of us who do not itemize deductions for our federal tax returns, we will now have to go through that effort for our state taxes so we can claim tax credits or end up paying more. Those of us who do itemize will have to do another round of calculations to determine our state tax credits in addition to our federal deductions. Isnï¿½t the purpose of tax reform to make the process easier? Adjusted for inflation, state spending has grown twice as fast as population over the last 25 years. Even after the fall in revenue, the state will collect more in the next fiscal year, again adjusted for population and inflation, than in any year before the dot-com bubble of 1999. I am not alone in my desire that you look for ways to save money and cut spending instead of raising taxes. Recent polls from the Civitas Institute show that 68 percent of people think cuts to existing programs are the best way to balance the budget. And 73 percent think lower taxes are a better way to stimulate the economy than higher government spending. The Federal stimulus money is a band-aid. Please use it to heal the broken state budget, eliminate programs, and not place more burdens on taxpayers. Sincerely, Fil Pagano

Governor,



I am hearing that there is a potential proposal that you are considering to take a tax increase on beer and wine. If this is the case, I want to strongly voice my opposition. I just fail to see how this will solve anything. The short term budget "wins" will be more than offset by the long term losses. Without a doubt, this will lead to a loss of jobs across the hundreds of facilities that work in this industry in the state. An increase in consumer pricing will lead to less dollars being spent in the category which will lead to significant industry layoffs.



But above all this, I just don’t understand how you can sit there and decide which industries have to suffer in order to fund programs that you decide will be more successful.



Sincerely,



Dan Holmes

Concerned citizen

To the Governor of North Carolina,

I have been informed that North Carolina is considering a 40 to 50% tax increase on beer and wine.

This would completely put my company out of business in North Carolina not to mention how much business the state would lose to your surrounding states.

I see this all the time; states with the highest taxes lose out to their neighboring states. If your citizens can save 40% on wine and beer in SC, GA, TN, and VA, where are they going to go to buy it? Who else gets hurt by all this? Well besides everyone, it will affect all of your restaurants, hotels, and retail stores putting most of them OUT OF BUSINESS. Maybe you think I’m exaggerating this. Did you know that most establishments make their only profits on their alcohol sales? It is not the food that pays the bills it’s the beverages. It is unfair to penalize the wine and beer industry. This is nothing more than a sin tax!! I hope that you will reconsider this action.

Thank you for your consideration,

Dear Governor:

I am writting to you today to share my deep concern regarding the Beer and Wine Tax your office and state is contemplating passing.
As a Wine Importer working in your lovely state for the past twenty years I am convinced that such tax would have a devastating effects in our industry.
Our overall business have been in dire straits since last fall and the last thing we need is yet another price increase that would most certainly cripple our industry and consequently cause more harm and more job losses.

Therefore, I hereby implore you to put an end to this tax project.

Truly yours,

Pascal F. Salvadori

To the Governor of North Carolina:

I am a wine supplier and we do significant business in the state of North Carolina.  I am writing expressing my hope that you do NOT increase the taxes on Beer, Wine or even Spirits.  I completely understand the economic times the country is facing.  And my company as well many others are fighting to make it through these times.  An increase in taxes within our industry will significantly negatively affect our business, our industry, the retailers, restaurants, consumers and on down the line.  The current taxes are significant already.

A tax increase will cause a significant reduction in sales and we've seen this happen before.  The loss of sales and business for the local retailer will result in lost jobs and the loss of businesses.

I hope that you do NOT pass the tax.

Thank you.

Subject: New Taxes on alcohol

Comment: I am concerned about people using disposable income to fuel and support our local economy. If taxes go up and people can not longer smoke in certain places, less money will be spent and tax generated off disposable incomes. I know we are in a bind but try cutting public officials salaries and I am not talking teachers. You could take it a step further and end the life salaries some of these politicians receive for serving only one term. Wow, what an idealist I am. I mean Nfong is still getting a life salary and look at what he did. I guess if I were in the club I would want to keep my money too. So what can you do? Increase the tax on beer and wine? I just think that would cause deeper issues with what few positive life style options people will have in the days to come.

Governor,

In times like these, you cannot continue to punish the residents of the
state to pay for years of government waste and over spending.  The key to
balancing budgets are cuts and economic growth.  Not punitive taxes on
certain businesses in the state.  Why do I never hear attorneys paying
larger corporate taxes to make up the shortfall?  How about pharmaceutical
companies?  If you want the residents of the state to make up the shortfall,
then everyone should pay their share, not just those that purchase beer,
wine or cigarettes.  So far you are looking like a one term governor, stop
acting like one.

Governor Perdue,

I voted for you and I agree with you on a lot of issues.
Nowhere in your campaign did I hear you say that you were going to have a field day with increased taxes.
I have worked as a controller for a beer distributor for 30 years.  
I also enjoy a beer and occasionally a mixed drink.
Now you have proposed not only an increase on the beer and alcohol tax, but on top of that an increase in sales tax on our products.  This appears to me that you
are "double dipping".
Do you not realize that these increased taxes will cost jobs in our industry and will worsen our economy?
"Experts" also say that taxes should not be raised in a recession.
Don't forget that the beer and alcohol industries make a significant contribution to the economy in North Carolina. 
If you continue as you have started on taxes it is apparent to me that you are not interested in running for governor again.
I hope you will reconsider this issue.
Sincerely,

Jerry L. Swinson

With all due respect Governor, this is really a bad idea. I have been in the wine business for fifteen years in NC, in the last two years sales have plummeted, consumers continue to buy less and less expensive wine, shrinking price points result in less profit. I now have to sell three times the quantity of wine that I sold three years ago to make an equal profit, which I cannot do. It is not easy to triple ones business even in the best of times.



How much more can consumers and small business do to compensate for hard economic times, enough is enough!!!



I do wish you the bests of luck in your hard job,

I have been informed that a proposal by the Governor is pushing for a 40% tax increase on beer and a 50% tax increase on wine in the state.  We are already in the top four states in the country in both categories. The continued increase of taxes has become crippling to a family trying to make a living and hopefully putting away something for retirement because we know no one else will take care of us but us. I don't expect the government to take care of me but I also don't expect to have my money whittled away at from every different angle. I'm asking that you look at other cost saving or income producing measures before increasing taxes. Thanks.

Dear Governor,



As a winery selling wine in the state of North Carolina, we would ask that you consider reducing your planned wine and beer tax.  Many jobs will be affected by the tax.  Your state will ultimately lose revenue.



Please consider the long term affects of your increased taxes.



Best regards,

Dear Governor Purdue,

I am writing to tell you of my concern regarding your proposal to raise beer & wine taxes in North Carolina. 

I work in the alcohol beverage industry and I can tell you that our business is already suffering significantly from the economic downturn.  Most of North Carolina's beer and wine distributors are local, family-owned, North Carolina-based businesses which will be hurt tremendously by your proposed increase.  The last time taxes were raised on our products most distributors had to lay off employees, and our industry did not recover for many years.  Independent restaurants are also currently struggling a great deal, and will also be affected by higher beer and wine prices.  We cannot afford to further stress these already struggling local businesses.

North Carolina already has some of the highest alcohol taxes in the nation.  Please reconsider your proposal and the effect it will have on the long-term health of our state's economy.

Best regards,

Molly McClure

Dear Governor:
Please reconsider any decision to increase the alcohol tax in NC. This would impact the working class in many negative ways. We use dinner events for our business meetings and a wine tax would significantly impact our budgets for both business and pleasure. This tax only affects a minority and there must be some other way to generate money in a manner that all may contribute in a smaller way. 
Please reconsider your idea of taxing wine/beer as so many of us are unsupportive.
Kindly,
Michelle Williams

Governor Perdue,
I would ask that you reconsider the alcohol tax increase that is being proposed by the state.  I understand the need for increased revenue in an effort to balance the state budget, however, I am concerned that in the state's quest for increased revenue there will be a negative impact on those NC state citizens who are employed within this industry.  I personally have a friend who is a alcohol distributor who has factual information that the last time the state increased alcohol taxes, local consumption dropped requiring his company to lay off employees.

In this time of economic unrest the last thing I want to see is the state's desire for increased revenue leading to my neighbor's unemployment.

Sincerely,
Lisa Pawlak-Gascoigne

This potential wine tax increase is not acceptable in this economy. Our business is suffering enough already. You are just adding to the already high amount of suffering. Please take into consideration that sales have already decreased significantly over the past two years. You are just adding to this reduction. The farmers of our great state have been hit twice as hard as everyone else. They have finally found a crop to grow that will thrive for years and years to come. You are potentially squashing this as well. I knew your campaign speeches of how you understood the farmer's situations was hog wash. You just wanted the pay check and the title. Thanks for nothing!

I am writing to you on behalf of American Beverage Corporation.  We sell our Wine Based Cocktail mixes and our wine based Ready to Drink products to thousands of consumers in North Carolina.  Any new jump in pricing in this economy has a dramatic effect on sales immediately.

We, ourselves, pulled back a price increase after assessing the price decreases in the country.  Customers are trading down at least 2 shelf positions currently causing lower dollar rings at the register.

If you have any questions that I can try to answer for you, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Dear Governor Perdue,



I am opposed to the proposed increase in the alcohol tax in North Carolina. I am not opposed to increasing taxes in general but have experienced the negative impact of increasing alcohol taxes. The Federal government increased the per case excise tax with expectations of generating additional revenue in the 90’s. Just the opposite happen. Sales volume went down resulting in less revenue and ten of thousands of jobs were eliminated in the restaurant industry.





Best regards,



Keith Schaufler

Subject: Save Lives and Healthcare Costs - Raise Revenue with the Cigarette Tax

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Yesterday Governor Perdue provided you with a pathway to protecting education and core services that included an increase in tobacco taxes. I am writing to you today to urge you to join in this effort and support raising the cigarette tax significantly. Raising the state cigarette tax is the only budget proposal on the table right now that will save lives and cut medical costs, in addition to raising badly needed revenue. At just 35 cents per pack, North Carolina's cigarette tax is far below the national average of $1.31 per pack. Consider that an increase of $1 would generate a projected $347.4 million in new revenue each year and reduce youth smoking by 16.5 percent. The General Assembly can make a positive impact on public health for years to come by bringing our cigarette tax closer to the national average with a $1 increase. The evidence is clear that increasing the cigarette tax is one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking, especially among kids. Studies show that every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by 7 percent and overall cigarette consumption by about 4 percent. At a time when North Carolina needs revenue - why not raise revenue and save lives at the same time? I urge you to support raising the state cigarette excise tax significantly.

Increasing the taxes on beer 40% and wine 50% is the wrong way to go and unfair to the millions of consumers in NC!

If raising state revenues must come to raising taxes, make fair increases all the possible revenue streams.

Why not a more modest increase that includes spirits, cigarettes, lottery tickets, energy drinks, ice cream, chocolates, etc?

If your going to tax the things that are no essential for you, tax them all, and tax them fairly…

just because I enjoy wine does not mean I should bear the brunt of the need to increase revenue… tax everything that in not essential to a healthy diet!



Just so you know, I prefer creating tolls on roads and bridges… by the way, why is it free to ride the ferry from Ocracoke to Hatteras… there are no free rides… charge those riders! Those ferries cost money to operate!

You are suppose to be fighting FOR the people not against the people, I am outraged by the fact that your office is even considering raising taxes and furthermore I am furious about the fact that your office has decreased the pay of our teachers who can not afford to be paid any less than they already are. If anyone in your office especially you your self Governor Perdue is making over 80,000 a year while taking money from the less fortunate should be disgusted, you and your fellow government officials are the ones that should be taking the pay cut to help with our dire economy you can afford it we can not.

To the Governor,
	As someone who has been involved with the North Carolina retail wine  
business since 1982, I can only say that a new tax on wine will  
simply lead creative and affluent consumers to buy out of state-- 
avoiding taxes altogether.Therefore, the highest amount of potential  
tax dollars will be irretrievably lost.
	Clearly this would be dismal news for the local economy as well. All  
independent wine shops, and grocery stores that sell wine, will be  
affected. Please rethink this proposed policy. I know from whence I  
speak. For 13 years I convinced people who shopped in Washington D.C.  
or Atlanta to look at how competitive North Carolina could be with  
aggressive pricing and lower retail mark-ups. The new tax will only  
cause the biggest spenders in our state to return to their old haunts  
and habits.

How much are you going to take???  Government keeps growing and growing and growing…  why don’t you just take it ALL and give it back to whomever you want??



This is asinine!  Do you realize that Government creates NOTHING, and does NOTHING well.  Private people and private industry does that!  All more taxes will do is:



A)      Put people out of work, because the costs will be passed down, and business will decline

B)      Grow government – oh wait… that’s what YOU WANT.

Please,no more taxes on beer and wine.My sales with this economy are down 25 to 30 percent and I work in Chapel Hill. People are already going for the cheaper products,and by raising the taxes it will only further the run to those products. These products are already taxed to the hilt,and it is unfair to single out anyone that drinks or smokes for that matter to balance the state budget. A across the board sales tax if there has to be oneis a much fairer way of doing this, God forbid that we could cut some of the pork!!!!!! out before we go this route.

Dear Govenor I truly appreciate all you are doing to help the state and the budget. But I CAN NOT back this increase on beer and wine. I do not drink, but my husband works for a distributorship and if this is passed they will have  major employee cuts. I am or should say "was" in the building industry. I was laid off in December and have not found new employment.
We are asking you to please reconsider your actions as the people of North Carolina can not take more taxes aand more unemployment.
I thank you for your time in reading this e mail.

To whom it may concern:

I write this not only as a consumer but as a professional working in this business.  I urge you not to increase taxes on beer and wine.  Not only will it hurt the sales of these items but you are going to affect the livelihood of many of us in this industry.  I understand the need to make a budget but this comes at a time when the industry is already suffering.  Please reconsider this action on behalf of consumers and industry professionals alike.

Dear Governor,
    Please do not approve the proposed beer and wine tax increase.  We already have a very high tax rate on alcohol in this state.  This tax will cost consumers an extra $50 million and hurt the 21,000 employees in the business.
    Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: Save Lives and Healthcare Costs - Raise Revenue with the Cigarette Tax

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: Yesterday Governor Perdue provided you with a pathway to protecting education and core services that included an increase in tobacco taxes. I am writing to you today to urge you to join in this effort and support raising the cigarette tax significantly. Raising the state cigarette tax is the only budget proposal on the table right now that will save lives and cut medical costs, in addition to raising badly needed revenue. At just 35 cents per pack, North Carolina's cigarette tax is far below the national average of $1.31 per pack. Consider that an increase of $1 would generate a projected $347.4 million in new revenue each year and reduce youth smoking by 16.5 percent. The General Assembly can make a positive impact on public health for years to come by bringing our cigarette tax closer to the national average with a $1 increase. The evidence is clear that increasing the cigarette tax is one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking, especially among kids. Studies show that every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces youth smoking by 7 percent and overall cigarette consumption by about 4 percent. At a time when North Carolina needs revenue - why not raise revenue and save lives at the same time? I urge you to support raising the state cigarette excise tax significantly.

Dear Governor,



We are a 5 year old wine and beer retail shop located in Wilmington NC employing three hard working citizens who depend upon this job to make ends meet.  Increasing taxes on the products that we sell would hurt our buisness and cause us to lose customers who responsibly enjoy our craft beverages.  The majority of our clientel fall into the middle class tax bracket that has been affected most by the downturn in the economy.  Any further taxation on wine and beer would position a lot of our customers outside of their budget that includes an occasional bottle of wine or beer.  Please don’t allow our locally owned buisness to fail because of this new taxation bill.  Thank You for your time and consideration.




Thanks for supporting your local wine shop.  Purple Smiles!

Pious, Sean, Jim, LuAnn & Chili

Dear Gov. Perdue,
Please reconsider increasing tax on beer and wine.  During these times of economic stress, we look forward to a nice cold beer or glass of wine to ease our nerves.  Considering we have had to cut back on travel and eating out, among other luxuries, we would really be feeling the pinch if we had to cut out our one vice.  Thanks for your consideration.  We think you are doing a great job as Governor and support your hard work for our great state.  God bless,
Anne and Matt Fortier

Governor:

With tough economic times for all consumers and suppliers in the state of North Carolina, it's unfair to place additional tax burdens on a select group of state residents and an industry that has many employees many in the state.

Please do not increase taxes on beer and wine!

Sincerely,
James Bailey, Jr.

Dear Govenor,

I urge you to not increase taxes on Beer and Wine in North Carolina.  You should be cutting costs in your DOT, your state administration.  They are wasteful and need to be cut severely.

Please do not increase taxes on your people.
