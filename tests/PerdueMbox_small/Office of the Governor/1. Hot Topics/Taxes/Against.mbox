Dear NC Elected Officials,
I've written the attached e-mail to my US Senators and Congressman. I'm sending this to you
folks, for when it comes to government, the same principals apply. We already have enough
waste and corruption in our government, coupled with the lame excuses for why things
can't be fixed, and you can see we are headed down the tubes.
Please pay attention here!
Thank you!
Jim Roberts
(919) 859-4343

"Dear Senator Burr,
I have sent the following e-mail to Senator Kay Hagan.
"Dear Senator Hagan,
Please watch this "YouTube" video.
"Gangster Government"
We have at least one representative in Washington who is willing to tell it like it is.
We need many more like this lady. I hope you can and will measure up to the tasks ahead!

 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thR-lVuztIY>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thR-lVuztIY

Please represent your constituents in North Carolina, and not the self interests of those in
our government. This 'Cap & Tax' will be the biggest tax hike in the history of our nation.
We are counting on you to do the right thing!
Please make sure that you have read and understand (including the unintended consequences
of) all legislation that the Senate must act on.
Please say NO to:
Cap and Trade (Cap & Tax).
The Health Care bill looming in the wings.
Any more 'bail outs.' Our elected officials must stop meddling with the market forces.
Any and all tax increases.
Surely, you must be able to see that the recession is deepening daily, and that the 'bailouts' just make things worse.
Surely, you must realize that we cannot spend our way out of debt. It has never happened. Impossible!
Surely, you can see that the US Dollar is weakening, and that our ability to borrow from other countries is waning.
Surely, you must be able to see that 'global warming' is a hoax. This is a time for our nation to lead ... not to follow blindly down a path of stupidity.
Please help to stop the 'government insanity!'
We are counting on you.
Sincerely,
Jim Roberts"
I hope you will watch the video, too.
I'm confident that you are on the right side of the issues outlined above, but I am also fearful that we are losing our country to the lunacy of the liberal left.
Can you think of anything that we, as citizens, can do to help stop the insanity and corruption that is taking place in our government?
I would appreciate your response.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Jim Roberts"

The only way to increase revenue is to DECREASE taxes which is PROVEN to promote economic growth.  Taking more money from those that ALREADY pay heavily into a system that DOES NOTHING FOR THEM since they are self-reliant is absurd.  This kind of thought is the EXACT reason my children attend private school and are NOT goverment educated.  Raising taxes on the producers of society to fund those that rely on entitlements from those that DO work is ridiculous and certainly does nothing to promote economic growth- which hurts everyone.  STOP practicing trickle-up poverty!!

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

I am NOT for another tax that everyone would pay.  I would rather cut services/education.  But if we add a 1 cent tax on soft drinks that would generate $37 M.  Since soft drinks are not necessary, it would be a personal decision if the drink is affordable.

How about showing some leadership in the Governor's Office and the General Assembly to pass a balanced budget.  Cut spending programs and shrink the size of the state government to create a balanced budget.  We don't need higher taxes, we need responsible government that doesn't try to punish small businesses, wealthy earners, and most everybody else in the state.

Governor, I know you have a rough road ahead but that is no excuse for raising taxes. Protect teachers. Fire administrators, kill "do nothing" programs, stop funding non-profits, halt new construction and reform state government by going to session limits and get the costs of SPENDING MONEY down.  Sooner or later we have to do these things. Don't make things worse by ignoring reality. Fight those who say it can't be done. It can.

Clayton Loflin, Former State Rep.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

Suggest you focus on cutting the budget instead of raising taxes.

I don't care how you frame it, this is not the time to raise taxes.  If you don't know how to cut expenditures, I suggest you check out the John Locke website.  They have some great recommendations.

As a former teacher, I can tell you that you are throwing money away and achieving nothing

A good teacher can educate and prepare a classroom of students with little more than a newspaper

I have watched as the supervisors offices get expensive new furniture

I see a lot of time wasted

I hear individuals in our schools making statements that they are just there for the paycheck and they will be gone in two or three years to another school and they do not care -  yes I have heard those exact words

When I was teaching, I watched the state spend thousands and thousands on programs that had no possibility of being completed



You need to teach the basics

Reading

Writing

Arithmetic

Reasoning



My first grade students could plan and complete a monetary program where they were responsible for the collection of funds, budget , acquisition of materials,

Implementation of plans, and resolution of project  



My third grade students were able to take notes and study from them for test .  When the next year assignments came out, it was necessary to divide them between two teachers as opposed to the 5 that was normal -  Why – because they were so far ahead of other students in study practices and  the ability to process the information in a classroom setting



You people just want to keep throwing good money after bad



We do not need more money -  We need more commitment

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Governor Perdue,

Cut, cut, cut, cut. I don't care if all of the teachers are put out of work. They primarily indoctrinate students with liberal garbage anyway. When will the tax rates (or as you like to put it-increased revenue) be high enough to satisfy politicians? Never. If you increase taxes now to cut the shortfall, in a few years when the economy improves, you people will invent some creative way to squander those extra dollars and come back to the taxpayers telling us how we need to tighten our belts for the sake of the children. You are an embarrassment. I can tell you how to close the shortfall. Cut, cut, cut and then cut some more. Another suggestion, throw all of the crooked politicians who are stealing left and right into jail. There's the solution. I'll never vote for anyone who supports any kind of tax increase or revenue increase, regardless of party affiliation.

Sincerely,

Matthew Cartrette

It is morally reprehensible that you keep using education as your scapegoat for bloated state government.  I've volunteered tow weeks of my time for free to show how we can reduce our budget without raising taxes.  Of course, you don't want this to happen because you want a big state government.

Hang in there. You can find the money in the budget. I don’t buy for one second that you have to cut into public education for our children. I do think a major reorganization of the bureaucracy needs to be examine, with incredible redundancy of spending across counties. I do think you can dig deeply into the university system however. A monolith has been built that needs a major overhaul to reduce waste, bureaucracy and overpaid and under-qualified teachers. I think the basic assumptions of what our university system should be need to be rethought. We don’t need to be teaching students throughout the world. Welfare programs should be eliminated and all non-essential services that should be taken care of by the private sector should be eliminated.



I think you need to surround yourself with people who question every assumption behind government spending and eliminate those things that really belong in the private sector. You have a long way to go to hit bottom of the cuts to the budget you can make.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



          Sincerely,


            Bev Perdue

Take the time to go back and learn what former President Ronald Reagan did.  He created something like 21 million new jobs during his presidency.  He did it by cutting taxes.  Short term, it may hurt to cut taxes.  Long term, it's the best thing that can happen to stimulate the economy.  You have been trying to convince folks that raising taxes on 88.9% of the folks still working is a good idea.  This may result in a short-term gain to your revenue, but it will have a negative impact over the long haul of making folks even more likely to hoard their money.  It will lengthen the time to economic recovery.

Spend less.  Cut taxes.  Watch the miracle of economic growth.

It's your choice.  Choose wisely.

Respectfully,

Joel Souther

Governor Perdue,

It is your job to lead and manage the affairs of the state not just tax the people. All I read about is this tax and that tax to bring in more money to the states account, that’s not the answer, you need to find cuts, and yes they will hurt but cut you must. Those of us out here can not just increase our income because hard times come, we have to cut our outgo and the state needs to do the same. Cut out all unneeded programs, reduce pay to all state employees and lay off those that are not needed for safty. Classes will have to get bigger in the schools, busses will need to be reduced for those kids that can walk to school, that’s just how it needs to be for now. Teachers need to take a pay cut just like everyone else.

Tom Grover
Mount Olive.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Over 10,000 public school system's employees losing their job and you say you are creating jobs.

Governor Perdue,
I know the state has a bunch of financial problems, but you have to live within your budget, That's what I have to do. I can't just tell my boss that I want to do things that I don't have income for and I'm going to take a raise from the company, it doesn't work that way unless you're in government and can take my money.

Don't raise my taxes, I can barely make it from payday to payday now. What happens when I can't make my house payment or car payment, will you do that for me? No, I think not, I'll have to figure out how to live on my income. I want you to do the same with this state. Priorities Governor, think cuts and if you need help, call me, I'm sure I can find things to cut.

Sincerely,

David A. Sizemore

Blah, blah, blah. Education needs more money, don't let us lay off teachers. I am sooo tired of the teachers always getting raises and spared from the cutting of the budget. Right now the teachers are on summer break, sure wish I could be off the summers and only have to work 7 to 8 months a year. I am getting ready to be laid off from my job at the end of July and I will have to start looking for a job. The teachers are going to have their jobs to go back to, they ought to be glad. My opinion is: for the schedule they work, they are all overpaid especially the principals and asst. principals. and superintendents. There are a lot more pressing concerns than teachers jobs. What about my job, the senior citizens, healthcare, and on and on? Let the classrooms and teachers tighten their belts like I am having to. Cut back on spending and DON'T RAISE MY TAXES!!

READ MY LIPS!!!!  NO NEW TAXES!   CUT SPENDING.   YOU KEEP MENTIONING CUTS IN EDUCATION.  THAT IS OUR FUTURE YOU ARE IMPACTING AND A GOOD POLITICAL MOVE TO IMPLY THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN BE CUT!   BUT, THERE IS A LOT OF PORK SPENDING IN OUR BUDGET THAT COULD BE CUT AND WOULD REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURES TREMENDOUSLY.  PLEASE, QUITE FOCUSING ON NEW TAXES AND CUTS TO EDUCATION.  LOOK AT OTHER PLACES THAT THE STATE IS SPENDING AND MAKE THE CUTS THERE.

Unemployment is up, taxes must be cut. Very simple. You raise taxes and you are OUT come election time. Stop being lazy and start making the hard decisions.

Keep cutting Bev. The NC public school system is overloaded with administrators that do not add value to the quality of education. Do not confuse cutting fat from the public education system with hurting the kids. Reforms are needed and this economic crisis presents an opportunity to finally address it.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our stateâ€™s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent â€” 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaâ€™s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateâ€™s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaâ€™s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaâ€™s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateâ€™s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299> 12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaâ€™s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has  been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaâ€™s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

Governor,  

What part of no more taxes don't you guys understand.  We are getting hammered from Washington, the state and the county.  What do you do in your household if you don't have money for something your want?  I ask that you pay attention to what happens on this July 4th.  People have had enough.  Listen to the people.  You are elected to do the will of the people.  Not what you think is right.  Do good for the people.  You work for us!

I couldn't disagree more.  Instead of increasing taxes on an already over-taxed populace, I suggest you find ways to cut the budget and get rid of all of the pork barrel spending that is part of the budget.  When times are tough, families don't have the ability to magically increase their income, so why should you and the rest of the tax and spend politicians be able to do it?  Quit taking the easy way out and do some real work.  Make the tough decisions and cut unnecessary spending.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

Don't raise taxes!!!   Figure out how to reduce spending. That is what we are doing in our household.

Governor Perdue,

I don't expect you to respond, but I hope you hear my plea.

Imagine you bought stock that paid you dividends everyday without  
fail.  Now imagine that some law took those dividends simply because  
the state you live in, even though your investment had retained its  
value.

That is exactly what your tax plan is doing to me and my family.

After losing my job in the mortgage industry last fall, I built a  
business of marketing for other companies online.  I spent time and  
money investing in these sites for returns everyday.  Those returns  
allow me to pay my mortgage and my household bills.  Those returns are  
what prompted my wife and I to feel secure enough to plan for our  
first child.

Our son is three months away from being born, and now I find out that  
your tax plan is taking my dividends away.  My advertising for another  
company DOES NOT mean they have a physical presence in the state and  
should not mean they have nexus under tax law.  My sites and  
investments are still sound and becoming more and more valuable, yet  
all of the advertisers are pulling out of the state because your tax  
scheme is too burdensome to comply with.  Virtually overnight you are  
taking my income away.  My investment hasn't changed, but simply do to  
the state I live in, my dividends will be gone.

Your plan is not going to result in additional revenue for the state,  
it will result in less.  And I am faced with becoming a burden on the  
state for the first time in my life or trying to sell a home in this  
economy and finding somewhere else to live.

Please stop this bill.  Please don't put me out of work and make my  
time and investment worthless over night simply because I call North  
Carolina home.

Jason Bostic

I disagree that being fiscally responsible will cripple our classrooms. 
If we are at a crossroads, then take the high road, stop the rhetoric, 
and keep your pledge not to raise taxes during a recession. Everyone is 
tightening their belts. State government should do the same. Teachers 
teach students not dollars, make the cuts intelligently, but do it.

	I feel you are using education and teachers to black mail we the people into tax increases.  I am opposed to any more tax increases/.  I don't know what you are doing with the taxpayers money but the taxes in this state are higher than in taxachussetts.  Something is wrong with this picture.  Cut the budget and stop using the teachers, health, and police as the scapegoats.  We all know that there is massive waste just in your own office. Cut the waste, not the vital services. And cut the taxes while you are at it.

Iâ€™ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our childrenâ€™s education.
The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.

We all see where this is going.  We can not afford any more taxes or fees.  It is killing us and the spending is obviously killing NC.  Please help us.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our stateâ€™s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent â€” 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolinaâ€™s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our stateâ€™s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolinaâ€™s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolinaâ€™s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our stateâ€™s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299> 12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolinaâ€™s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has  been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolinaâ€™s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

Let’s not overlook the role of government at both the state and federal level in creating the recession and contributing to the budget shortfall through irresponsible policy, particularly in the area of spending beyond that which is truly needed to govern.  Yet at both the federal and state level, our elected officials continue to over-reach, spend dollars on socialist programs that only serve to get those same officials re-elected.  No, now is not the time to increase the tax burden of those already paying the bills, now is the time for fiscal responsibility AND term limits for those who have lost touch with their neighbors.  Your administration has shamefully mirrored that of the president and congress.

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



          Sincerely,


            Bev Perdue

Dear Govenor-

I understand that our state is in tough economic times, but the best way to handle this is to cut government spending NOT tax the citizens more. Increasing taxes will only slow our economic recovery more.

Thanks.

Joel Fanti

	Gov. Purdue.  People pay taxes.  Government spends.  I cannot spend more than I take in and neither should the state. I cannot condone you call for more taxes.  It is time to cut programs.   I am considering relocation of my business to a state that is more fiscally responsible.  I moved from PA in 1986 to what was a more friendly state with regard to taxes.   Wake up and smell the coffee. Pass this along to your friend in the state House and Senate.

Ms. Perdue,
It's time to CUT expenses, there's plenty of FAT in your budget, and plenty of WASTE in all your departments. Time to tell your department heads to submit budgets at 90% of last years budgets. You'll be surprised that these departments can EASILY run efficiently with 90% of last years budget. The problem with you "INSULATED from reality" prima donnas, is that you have no idea what we common (let them eat cake") people have to deal with each and every day, while you dunces can only think of haw to extract more money from the hard working (and now unemployed) people who pay your salaries. It's rather obvious, you folks don't give a damn about us out here. Try a little REALITY. cut the budget.

You talk about transparency, but you will not come out and say what you mean, you want to raise our taxes. I say cut to the bone because all you democrats know how to do is tax and spend. You have so many useless programs that you are requiring the hard working citizens to pay for, I say cut to the bone. You sure will not mind making the working, legal, people of NC to cut there budgets to the bone. If you would get the non US citizens out of our public schools we would not be having this conversation. Besides, what happen to all the money you dems told us the public schools were going to get from the lottery? Was this one more of the lies we were were told?     
I say cut, cut, cut to the bone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Governor Perdue,

In all respect, rather scaring people and cutting services, why don’t you cut out the expansions in the budget?  Also, get rid of the pork and special projects like the pier project?  I speak to many people and all of us are sick of the scare tactics and the freeloaders!  Time to cut back on everything, not just on education, health, and welfare.  I for one say, cut the welfare and quit giving illegals money! 

Just another disillusioned North  Carolinian

State of the Budget

For more than a year North Carolina, along with many states, has felt the impact of the national recession, which many of you have already experienced first-hand.

In that time, our state’s unemployment rate has almost doubled and now stands at 11.1 percent — 7th highest in the nation. Just as North Carolina’s families have been hurt by the recession, so has our state’s budget.

The General Assembly is working to finalize a budget that, because of a decrease in revenues, has a $4.7 billion shortfall for the 2009-10 fiscal year and even more next year. It is one of the largest shortfalls in the country, and it is the largest in North Carolina’s history.

Despite these monumental challenges, we have been able to achieve significant accomplishments in the last few months. Since taking office in January, I have worked to uphold the highest standards of accountability and transparency to ensure North Carolina’s government is working in the best interest of its people, doing more with what little we have in these tough times.

This administration has streamlined policy-making and management in the public education system by appointing a CEO of public education. We have instituted more accountability and transparency in our state’s mental health and probation systems, and we are taking the politics out of decision-making at the Department of Transportation.

Through my <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW initiative, we are putting thousands of people to work, quickly investing federal recovery dollars and opening doors to new job opportunities. One example is my <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=299>12 in 6 program, a partnership with community colleges to retrain workers for high-demand jobs in less than six months.

Last month, I outlined a set of reforms and investments to establish this state as a leader in green energy jobs and business. And in March, I presented a balanced budget that invested in job creation and education, priorities that establish a strong base for North Carolina’s long-term economic growth.

Since that time, however, the state budget hole has increased by another $1 billion.

As a result, budget proposals from legislators to date have included profound cuts to core government services.

We are now at a crossroads: We can choose to protect core education, public safety and health care services, or we can allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms.

Public education always has been, and always will be, the engine driving North Carolina’s economy toward a future with secure, high-wage jobs. Gutting public education now would throw away decades of investment and would cut short our long-term economy.

As I work with legislators to finalize the budget in coming days, we will need to cut deeply. But while we must cut the fat, we must not cut to the bone.

I’ve traveled the state calling on legislators to raise the revenue necessary to protect public education.  Now I need your help.  The budget crisis threatens our classrooms and so many other vital services, including health care and public safety.  But if we act now we can save thousands of jobs and protect our children’s education.

The time has come for the General Assembly to step up its efforts to pass a budget quickly and with the revenue necessary to protect the classroom. Our children and our economic future depend on it.



          Sincerely,


            Bev Perdue

	You have done nothing but insist on massive tax increases across the board.  In effect you wish to make hard times even harder.  I will not support even one cent in tax increases until you cut the waste from state government.  That is the bottom line.  Cut the waste, get rid of all the pet projects and pet employees and then we'll debate the tax increase issue.  Until that time we have nothing more to discuss.

Thank you,

Steven R. McComas

We do not need to "raise revenue" (ie taxes) when people can barely afford the essentials.  Raising taxes in this economy is a JOB KILLER and will lead to further declines in revenue.  Politicians cannot convince ordinary citizens otherwise.  The truth is that the fat has not been cut from state government.  I work in downtown and see numerous examples of waste everyday.  Some examples: stop air conditioning the parking garages at the legislature, the police/ security force at the legislature could be replaced with state capitol police, it is not necessary to have a police officer in every state building, close state supported snack bars/cafeterias and replace them with vending machines, and the list goes on.  If state government would eliminate all unessential functions, there would be a surplus, even in this economy.
