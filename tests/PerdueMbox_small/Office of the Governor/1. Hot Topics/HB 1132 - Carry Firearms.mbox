Subject: Raise My Taxes!

Comment: James Wright 9600 Vinca Circle, Apt B Charlotte, NC 28213-0549 July 20, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: It's time to come together. I'm asking you, as one of our state's leaders, to come together with your colleagues, and to agree on a budget that helps North Carolinians through this difficult time and sets us up for future prosperity. To do that, we must raise a significant amount of new revenue. Thanks to your leadership and the leadership of your colleagues and predecessors, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, and family stability. Now is not the time for you to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. You supported a balanced approach in your first budget by including new revenue and that helped to prevent the most devastating of cuts. I am asking you now to stick to your commitment to raising revenue so we can preserve the vital investments in education, healthcare, and public safety that make North Carolina such a wonderful place. When I think of a North Carolina with educated children, safer streets and healthy communities, I say: "It's worth raising revenue to do that." Thank you. Sincerely, James Anthony Wright 7048594613

Comment: You might consider legislation to give the concealed carry permit licensing authority/responsiblity to the Highway Patrol/SBI in order to remove it from the various Sheriffs departments. It would be more efficient as a central agency and also increase their revenue.
