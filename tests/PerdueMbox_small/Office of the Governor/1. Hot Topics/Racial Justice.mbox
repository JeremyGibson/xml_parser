Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #1906] Proposed racial justice bill will mean no justice at all
Date: Mon, 3 Aug 2009 16:55:51 -0400

Dear NC Leaders:

I will be brief, but I want to point out some of the many flaws in the proposed Racial Justice Act.

My husband was murdered in Forsyth County almost 16 years ago.  My family has been from trial through 9 years of appeals to clemency hearing to witnessing the execution of Robbie Lyons.  Lyons shot my husband multiple times in our business in an attempted armed robbery.  Before his execution, he had 40 some infractions and punched a guard in the eye.

  I have been a very active advocate for crime victims since that time.  Yes, I could spend my time doing many things that I would enjoy better, but most people will never understand the passion of victims who seek to be heard, rights for victims with our laws, and most of all justice for a heinous murder and for the punishment to be carried out.

*There are 163 death row murderers with 270 victims, and victim's families will have to wait more years to have justice.  With the execution of the murderer comes some peace and relief of the fear that this murderer will not hurt anyone again.  With life sentences there is always the possibly of release by sentence being overturned, clerical error, pardoned, change in law such as with this Racial Act.

*Consider the safety of the state's citizens when death sentences are changed to life and those murderers sentenced before Oct. 1994 will be released after 20 years in prison.

*Justice and punishment should be based on guilt.  Juries must weigh the aggravated and mitigating factors.  Race should not be one of the factors.

*I see this bill as a means to end capital punishment; however, there remains a large majority of public support for the death penalty for the taking of a person's life.

*In the appeals process of 10+ years the proceedings are reviewed by some 30 judges and reviewed for proportionality to other cases.

*I must point out that Rep. Womble's statement that Darryl Hunt was almost executed
is not true.  Hunt was NEVER on death row.

*There have been more whites executed in the US and in NC than blacks.  There is no proof of an innocent person being executed since 1900.

*Studies from various universities have indicated that murders do increase significantly when there is no capital punishment.

*NC should not spare murderers at the cost of sacrificing more innocent lives.

If this bill is passed, families will have more years added to the appeals process before they will see justice carried out.  In the courtroom, families should not have to hear that the murderer of their loved one cannot be tried for his life because of racial quotas.  Taxpayers should not have to pay for duplication of the safeguards that are already in place.

Comments I have heard from family, friends, church members, crime victims, letters to editors of newspapers are what a stupid bill.  People can easily see what the motivation is behind this bill.

I urge you to take a stand for the citizens of this state and VOTE NO.

Governor Perdue:

I hope you will not sign this bill in the interest of crime victims who want justice and punishment for the heinous crime of murder and for our citizens who will have to pay millions to handle the appeals from death row and statisticans hired for courtrooms across the state.  Public safety is also a consideration as we cannot know when some of these murderers could be released.

Following is more information that I emailed to the Senators yesterday that points out the flaws in this bill.

I trust you can see the flaws in this legislation and will not sign it.

Ramona Stafford
Forsyth County Victim Advocate 




Dear Senator:

The NC Racial Justice Act (SB461) has been recalendared for today.  This is still bad legislation as I have sited to you by email and phone calls to you this week.

My husband was murdered in 1993 for an attempted armed robbery of our business.  My family has been from trial through 9 years of appeals, clemency hearing and execution in 2003.  I can so understand the angrier and frustration by families who have the murderer on death row and will be faced with more years of delay if this bill is passed.

I have such sadness for those families who will be sitting in courtrooms across our state
trusting in our system of juries to find the guilty person and the punishment they deserve for taking the life of their loved one.  If this bill is passed, only to find that punishment is measured by quotas/statistics/percentages based on race rather than by the weight of the evidence, aggravating and mitigating factors.  It is up to twelve people to weigh that evidence and determine the punishment.  Legislators you must hold murderers accountable not by allowing them to have a lesser sentence because of race, nationality etc.

When Rep. Womble stood and spoke on the floor of the House recently, he failed to tell and describe the brutal murders the death row defendants committed.  Prosecutors really do not know how many shots were aimed at my husband, but they do know that he was hit three times with one of those the gun put to his back and the murderer kept shooting until he emptied the gun.  I have listened to other trials where the defendant repeatedly used a tire iron until their victim was dead.  You do not hear about the victim only that the murderer is getting punishment that he does not deserve.  You will not hear about the victim today either.

I know you are busy legislators and will not continue to tell you how bad this bill is for the safety of the public as university studies have shown that murders do increase when there is no capital punishment.  Crime victims will be hugely impacted, and it cannot be known if next year there will be a proposed bill to change the sentences to 2nd degree.  The medical board lawsuit did not stop executions so the tactics will continue.  It is quite clear that this bill is another step to end executions, and you must know that these murderers are evil with no regard for human life, and there is huge support from the citizens for capital punishment. 

Following is some information from the Center for Death Penalty Litigation which was compiled for a Forsyth County murderer, Thomas Michael Larry:

The Center for Death Penalty Litigation study examined all Forsyth County
murders from 1993 to 2003:
There were 383 murderers
247 murderers were black (64.4%)
83 murderers were white (21.6%)
1 murderer was Native American (0.2%)
52 murderers were of Unknown race (13.5%)
There were 25 capital trials in Forsyth County
17 whites and blacks received the death penalty
10 who received the death penalty were black (58.8%)
7 who received the death penalty were white (41.1%)
Only 1 black received the death penalty for killing a white (during a
robbery) (Note: The defendant, Robbie Lyons, first went to reform school at
age 8. During the trial, Lyons threw a rolodex at the judge.)
6 blacks received the death penalty for killing other blacks
3 blacks received the death penalty for killing Hispanics
8 whites and blacks who were tried capitally did not received the death
penalty
Of those 8 who did not received the death penalty, 5 were black, 2 were
white and 1 was Hispanic

Only one was executed for murdering a white person, my husband Stephen Stafford and that is the reason I am an advocate today for the murdered victim as their voice has been silenced.

Please do not support this unjust bill and vote "NO"

I was very disappointed that the Racial Justice Act passed the Senate 
today.  As I have written, it is a solution in search of a problem.  I 
attach a guest editorial by me that was ironically published today.  
Passage of this act will cost the State a great deal of money and will 
enrich lawyers and statistical consultants like me.  It will not help 
African-Americans but will certainly benefit White murderers.  Further 
information is on my website http://www.unc.edu/~cramer/death/.

Following is the Constituent Services Submission just received:
Visitor: Michael Walker

Address: 3337 Paddington Lane, Winston-Salem, NC 27106

Email: staballoy@yahoo.com

Subject: Please veto the so-called Racial Justice Act

Comment: This a bad law, based on cherry-picked statistics. Supporters ignore the disportionate number of crimes committed by minorities and the disportionate number of murders inflicted by minorities on whites. They also ignore the fact that black-on-black murders frequently receive less severe sentences because killer and victim frequently knew each other, whereas a black-on-white murder is frequently a "stranger killing." These typically receive harsher sentences, as you know. This bill is based on statistical manipulation and racial pandering. It also appears to be backdoor attempt to eliminate the death penalty altogether, which is an issue that is certainly debatable, but that should be addressed and debated directly. I respectfully urge that this legislation be vetoed.

Subject: Racial Anti-Justice Act

Comment: I am writing to ask you to veto this bill. This is the next thing to doing away with the death penalty altogether. It is my opinion that if a oerson commits a serious crime such as rape, murder, etc., they should face the death penalty regardless of their race or color. It is also my opinion that this state needs to start enforcing the death penalty that is currently in place. And let's not wait 20 to 30 years to do it. Criminals have more rights today than victims, and by vetoing this bill you could start to reverse that fact. Thank you for your time.

Dear Governor Purdue, ,

Thank you for your leadership in signing the Racial Justice Act.
 
With the passage of this historic reform, NC acknowledges that race has played a role in our use of capital punishment and offers a remedy to such racial bias. 
 
I am proud to see my Governor stand beside so many Legislators, concerned advocates and individuals and courageously say to the rest of America: if and when the death penalty is to be handed down, it can never be on the impermissible basis of race. 
 
Thank you for your integrity and leadership.

Dear Gov. Perdue,

Thank you for standing up for justice through signing the Racial Justice Act into law.

Your public support set an example for governors across our country on that day. You should be proud for being on the right side of history and for offering such leadership for your peers and all citizens to follow.

Until this state becomes an example of valuing ALL life by reversing our use of the death penalty, it is imperative that all measures are taken to implement execution in as fair a way as possible.  This act is one step in the right direction.

It is my hope and prayer that you, as Governor, will not have to oversee the final decisions concerning an individual's execution. It would require great courage and foresight to reverse an order of execution.  To date, a NC governnor has not shown those qualities.....but I know this is a difficult burden to put on any individual in power.

Given the current status of capital punishment in our state, I am deeply appreciative that you signed this bill.  I will remain committed in my own work to remove the death penalty from the NC court system, and trust that I may be communicating with you again in the future.

Sincerely,

Ms. Jamie E  Huss

 Ma'am,
 I am very disappointed that you signed into law Bill 461.  Racial statistics have no place in the administering of judicial punishment.  You have only provided more rights to the crimminal than the victims.  Racial issues are already addressed in other laws.

> Budget Revenue Enables School Districts to Rehire Teachers, Protect Jobs

This year’s budget shortfall was a major challenge.  It was the toughest budget situation since the Great Depression, with a $4.5 billion shortfall. While the final version of the budget was far from perfect, it did include significantly more revenue for public schools than previous proposals.  Additionally, public school systems are directly receiving almost $600 million in federal recovery funds during the next two years.

> So far, at least a dozen superintendents in North Carolina have already announced they will restore or save teacher jobs by maximizing those resources.  Governor Perdue strongly urges superintendents across the state to do the same.

> Gov. Perdue Signs North Carolina Racial Justice Act

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday signed Senate Bill 461, the North Carolina Racial Justice Act, which permits defendants and inmates to challenge death sentences by presenting statistical evidence of racial bias. The bill was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) and in the House by Rep. Larry Womble (D-Forsyth), Rep. Earline Parmon (D-Forsyth), Rep. Paul Luebke (D-Durham) and Rep Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford).

> “I have always been a supporter of death penalty, but I have always believed it must be carried out fairly,” said Perdue. “The Racial Justice Act ensures that when North Carolina hands down our state’s harshest punishment to our most heinous criminals – the decision is based on the facts and the law, not racial prejudice.”

> The Racial Justice Act will allow inmates on death row and persons charged with a capital crime to present a judge with evidence that shows race was a significant factor that led to the imposition of the death sentence. If the judge agrees with the evidence, the death sentence can be overturned to life in prison without possibility of parole.

> Deutsche Bank to Create 319 Jobs in Wake County

Deutsche Bank AG will open a technology development center in Wake County. Operating as DB Global Technology Inc., a newly formed subsidiary, the company plans to invest $6.7 million and create 319 jobs during the next five years.

> “This new center is a great fit for North Carolina. We are a strong international competitor in both the information technology and financial sectors,” Perdue said. “Our reputation for excellence in these areas, combined with a dedicated workforce and a top business climate, continues to attract quality global companies such as Deutsche Bank.”

> Perdue has made creating well-paying, sustainable jobs a top priority of her administration through the JobsNOW initiative. The new jobs at DB Global Technology will pay an overall average wage of $88,213, not including benefits, which is significantly higher than the Wake County average of $43,160.

> Through Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will continue to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain workers, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) is a leading global investment bank with 78,896 employees in 72 countries. For more information about the company, including employment opportunities, please visit <http://www.db.com>www.db.com. 

> Visitor Spending Rises in 62 N.C. Counties in 2008

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Wednesday that 62 of the state’s 100 counties saw increases in visitor spending in 2008, including 16 counties that had increases of more than 5 percent.

> Data from the N.C. Department of Commerce’s Division of Tourism, Film and Sports Development showed domestic visitors to and within North Carolina spent a record $16.9 billion in 2008, an increase of 2.1 percent from 2007.

> Visitor expenditures directly generated 190,500 jobs and nearly $4.2 billion in payroll income within North Carolina in 2008.  Payroll increased 3.9 percent from 2007. Visitor spending in the state also directly generated close to $2.7 billion in tax revenue for federal, state and local governments in 2008, up 3.6 percent from 2007.

> “We know that current economic conditions are affecting businesses all across the state, including those in the tourism industry,” Gov. Perdue said. “But this continued economic growth, and especially growth in tax revenues, is encouraging.”

> The visitor spending figures are the results of an annual study commissioned by the Division of Tourism, Film and Sports Development and conducted by the U.S. Travel Association.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=559>> Individual county data on spending, tax revenue and employment is available here.

Dear Gov. Perdue,

Thank you for standing up for justice through signing the Racial Justice Act into law.

Your public support set an example for governors across our country on that day. You should be proud for being on the right side of history and for offering such leadership for your peers and all citizens to follow.
Although I no longer live in North Carolina for now, my sincere plan is to return after caring for an elderly in-law. Your actions reinforce my faith in the justice system in North Carolina and makes me even more anxious and excited to return with elected officials who act as you have. Thank you and even from afar (not that far) your efforts are applauded and appreciated!!!! Truly you are a gift to North Carolina citizens and voters!!1
Sincerely,

Mary Quigley
