Subject: DELL reimbursement of incentives to the State of NC

Comment: Many businesses purchase DELL product in NC as well as many STATE, CITY, COUNTY, AND EDUCATIONAL entities operating in and for the State of North Carolina. If DELL wants to not honor the full reimbursement of incentives to which the State of NC is entitled, I would suggest a moratorium on purchases of DELL products by NC STATE, CITY, COUNTY and EDUCATIONAL entities. Dell is a well priced product and is on NC State Contract as an approved resource. Should the State of NC continue to allow DELL products to be purchased creating revenue for DELL while DELL refuses to honor the incentive reimbursement to which the State is entitled? As a taxpayer in NC, I would hope not. Governor Purdue, if a moratorium is not legally possible, at least make a statement to the agencies under NC government jurisdiction, publicly, that this situation should be considered when agencies are making purchasing decisions that involve Dell product. Thank you for considering. I would be interested in your thoughts on this strategy.
