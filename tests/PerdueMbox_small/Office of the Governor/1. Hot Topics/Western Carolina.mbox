Dear Governor Perdue: Sounds good on renewable energy, but we must phase out coal rapidly.†

We cannot add any new coal plants like Cliffside or water-guzzling nuclear plants with all their present hazards and deep costs†to the environment.† These must be put on hold until the day, if ever, they become truly clean.† Research within reason, spend on renewables, but please do not side track on pie-in-the-sky by and by technologies.† Thank you.† Best regards to my friends Jim Rogers and Roberta Bowman.†

Sincerely,
Deb Arnason 360 Webb Rd, Wadesboro, NC 28170 704-851-3925

Governor Perdue takes Additional Steps to Manage State's Cash Flow

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Thursday†instructed the Office of State Budget Management† to take steps to manage the state‚Äôs cash flow in order to meet its financial obligations.

Effective immediately,†the Governor enacted additional limitations on spending throughout state government, including freezing the purchase of goods and services, ceasing all travel not approved for public safety, public health and economic development reasons, and leaving unfilled personnel positions vacant. Exceptions may be made for direct classroom instruction expenses and emergency situations related to law enforcement, health care and public safety

‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to face budgeting challenges. My decision to limit agency spending is crucial to North Carolina‚Äôs ability to meet our financial obligations and to provide essential services†for our citizens,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.

Additionally, Gov. Perdue identified 18 areas from which some $145 million in funds will be transferred to maintain cash flow in the General Fund.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=289>For the list, click here.


Scotland County Adds Natural-Products Manufacturer, 98 Jobs

Nature‚Äôs Earth Products Inc., the nation‚Äôs largest supplier of natural cat litter and manufacturer of hardwood-blend fuel pellets, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Laurinburg.† The company plans to invest more than $12 million and create 98 jobs during the next three years in Scotland County.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $196,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs forward-looking policies continue to attract companies specializing in emerging green-industry markets,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state‚Äôs skilled workforce, top-rated business climate and extraordinary quality of life offer the perfect environment for businesses like this one to locate and expand here.‚Äù

The One North Carolina Fund provides financial assistance, through local governments, to attract business projects that will stimulate economic activity and create new jobs in the state.† Companies receive no money up front and must meet job creation and investment performance standards to qualify for grant funds.† All of these grants also require and are contingent upon local matches.

Through use of the One North Carolina Fund, more than 35,000 jobs and $6.5 billion in investment have been created since 2001.† Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, Scotland County, City of Laurinburg and the N.C. Rural Center.


Jackson County Manufacturer to Add 61 Jobs

Stonewall Packaging LLC, a joint project of <http://www.jacksonpaper-nc.com/>Jackson Paper Manufacturing Co., is building a new plant in Sylva to produce recycled cardboard packaging.† The company plans to invest more than $16 million to renovate and modify a vacant mill, creating 61 jobs in Jackson County.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $200,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

‚ÄúAs global markets evolve, North Carolina‚Äôs manufacturing sector is keeping pace to take advantage of new opportunities,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúCompanies like this one are investing in green-friendly products while continuing to enjoy our state‚Äôs top-rated business climate, skilled workforce and unparalleled quality of life.‚Äù

The 61 new jobs will pay an average of $39,344, not including benefits, which is more than the Jackson County average annual wage of $27,820.† The company will begin hiring this summer.

Project partners include: the state Department of Commerce, the Department of Revenue, Department of Transportation, N.C. Community Colleges, Southwestern Community College, Jackson County, the Town of Sylva, the N.C. Rural Center and Duke Energy.


Growing†a Green Economy

Speaking at a Charlotte energy summit on Monday, Gov. Perdue reiterated her view that North Carolina is poised to lead the nation‚Äôs green economy.† As she said in her speech: ‚ÄúThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years ‚Äì and North Carolina must be that state.‚Äù†

Dear Beverly Perdue:

     
I was dismayed to learn that the leaders of the Western Carolina 
University (WCU) have slated the school's Clinical Laboratory Science 
(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.


†The laboratory is the front line of defense to diagnosising illness and 
we need well educated, well trained staff to provide this valuable service.

     

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.	

Sincerely,

understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.

†78% of the schools of Medical Technology open in 1980 ....ARE CLOSED.  
The average age of a Medical Technologist in our facility is 53 years and 
within 7 years, 37% of my workforce will retire.  This is a crisis that 
will affect ALL Georgians, especially the next generation.  We must 
continue to train the professionals thAt will perform the lab testing for 
us in our retirement and for our children ... and their children.

The light at the end of the tunnel is NOT a solution to the problem.  It 
is the train of retirement and staffing shortages which will adversly 
affect each and every Georgian and American citizen in the very near 
future.   

GOVERNOR PERDUE, PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING FOR GEORGIA'S CITIZENS - SECURE 
AND CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM.  WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

you that providing robust support for the WCU CLS program is critical to 
your citizens' access to quality healthcare. 

     

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.

Dear Beverly Perdue:

     
I was dismayed to learn that the leaders of the Western Carolina 
University (WCU) have slated the school's Clinical Laboratory Science 
(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.

Are you one of the many who think that, because there's so much automation 
in the laboratory, any unlicensed high school graduate can do the job? Let 
me ask you this. When you get a therepeutic massage or get your hair done, 
you want your hairdresser or massage therapist to be licensed, right? Why 
would you then, entrust the running of laboratory tests or matching blood 
for transfusions, to an unlicensed person?  The average age of lab 
scientists in the USA is about 54 years. We need licensed replacements to 
take care of US in our old age!

(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.


†Our Virginia hospital labs also suffer from a dearth of new clinical lab 
scientists and are chronically understaffed; we, too, rely on graduates 
from neighboring states in addition to Virginia grads. I am typical of 
today's medical technologist: fifty-something, and planning on retiring in 
the next 10 years.  It is unclear how our country's labs can stay open and 
provide the quality of care required for our citizens without an increase 
in CLS students. States need to take advantage of the federal funding 
available, and expand, not close, our CLS programss.

     

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.

When we or our family members enter the hospital, it is known that 60-75% 
of the patient diagnosis is based on the results of laboratory tests.  
Tests are done by technologists and technicians that have graduated from 
laboratory programs.  It is in all of our best interest to have a properly 
trained individual to conduct these tests.

Governor Perdue,
After almost 40 years as a medical technologist in a large urban teaching 
reference hospital, I have done just about everything from mass blood 
drawing and  mass cleanup with gallons of chlorox to sophisticated 
computer program maniulations. All to get the best  for our "clients".   
In my case, that is the pediatric oncology.  In my lifetime, I have been 
part of finding a cure for common childhood leukemia.  That makes me feel 
good and the that the whole journey has been important, even with all of 
the increasing necessary overtime. Starting this was my education at a 
land grant university in a rural applachian state.  Some times they did 
things I thought silly, but time after time I discovered the words from 
the wise have proven incredibly useful and saved me from critical errors.  
Soon to be retiring, I worry about the next generation, with  fears that 
there won't be a next generation.   People are important here- both the 
patient and the provider.  Yes, machines can do alot of work, but I've 
found, that with my experience and my solid science background started 
many years ago in college, I can  make informed decisions. That this often 
affects just one child's journey back to life and good health is the most 
improtant thing I do.   We need trained professionals.  PLease keep the 
school open.  We need that new next generation -desperately.  

     

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.	

Sincerely,


Judy Hutchison (MT)ASCPSH

Dear Beverly Perdue:

     
I was dismayed to learn that the leaders of the Western Carolina 
University (WCU) have slated the school's Clinical Laboratory Science 
(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.


†As the Director of Laboratory Operations at a mid-sized hospital 
laboratory, the shortage of laboratory professionals, especially CLSs, is 
problem that hits home.  Of my current staff of 38 individuals, 22 of them 
are over 50 years old.  That means that in the next few years a large 
percentage of my staff will turn over.  We need more programs to help the 
nationwide shortage! 

Thank you for your help with this issue!

†Governor Perdue,
    70% of all medical decisions are based on the results of laboratory 
testing.  Good laboratory results depend on having a well educated and 
well trained staff.  I have been working in a teaching hospital for 34 
years.  I am the education coordinator for the Medical Technology students 
that rotate through our hospital every year.  Having a School of Medical 
Technology affiliated with our hospital has insured us a very constant 
supply of extremely qualified and talented technologists.  It's important 
to remember that the 1970's saw the highest enrollment in laboratory 
medicine programs in history.  The techs that graduated  with me are at 
retirement age now.  Like nurses, you will be facing severe and life 
threatening shortages within the next few years.  Please keep your school 
open.  You will ultimately be saving lives, perhaps your own or someone 
you love.  Thank you.

†Dear Governor Perdue, 

Please do not allow the closing of the CLS/MT program at WCU.  These 
schools are vital to medical technology.  There is a huge shortage of 
medical technologists in our nation.  Most laboratories are having to 
recruit foreign medical technologists.  This is expensive to our 
healthcare system, plus it takes jobs away from U.S. citizens.  Let's keep 
our med tech schools open and provide jobs for our citizens.  Thank you 
for your consideration.

Dear Beverly Perdue:

     
I was dismayed to learn that the leaders of the Western Carolina 
University (WCU) have slated the school's Clinical Laboratory Science 
(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.	

Sincerely,


Marina Pejcic

†As a Bachelor's degree Medical Technologist with almost 30 years of 
experience in the field, I can attest to the importance of keeping 
programs to adequately train laboratory technologists. I think you will 
agree that those people performing the tests upon which physicians make 
their diagnoses should have the best possible education. No one would 
think of discontuing medical education to those wishing to become doctors; 
the same should apply to those professionals behind the scenes. We need 
quality education in order to provide quality health care. Thank you for 
your time; please don't close the only program in your state.

†I have worked as a laboratory scientist in the Atlanta area for 13 years. 
Thirteen years ago we had a shortage of medical technologists that has 
persisted. The only Medical Technology program in Atlanta closed  about 10 
years ago. At that time our vacancy rates  increased and those vacant 
positions are open longer. The closest program to Atlanta within Georgia 
is in Augusta 3 hours away. Western Carolina University is in a geographic 
region that can train Medical Technologists for several southern states 
with high vacancy rates. Instead of closing your program please consider 
marketing it to potential students in Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina 
and Virginia as well as your own state.

Governor Perdue, please save the University's CLS program. There is a 
nationwide need for laboratory professionals. Western Carolina boasts a 
steady stream of graduates that helps to fill that need. Saving Western 
Carolina's program leads to saving laboratory education and ultimately the 
field. There is indeed a fierce urgency now. I urge you to use money in 
the state's portion of the stimulus money to secure an education for the 
state's residents, to supply needed health care professionals and 
ultimately to ensure quality care for North Carolina patients.	

Sincerely,

Dear Beverly Perdue:

     
I was dismayed to learn that the leaders of the Western Carolina 
University (WCU) have slated the school's Clinical Laboratory Science 
(CLS) program to close. As a member of the nation's laboratory team, I 
understand the critical role the laboratory plays. Moreover, there is a 
critical shortage of laboratory personnel nationwide and the need for 
qualified laboratorians continues to grow. In fact the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports there would be a demand for 15,000 new laboratory 
professionals each year through 2014. Yet fewer than 5,000 graduates come 
out of accredited or approved schools annually.  Once the WCU-CLS faculty 
has left for other institutions, there is little chance that the program 
will ever be restored.  The doors to laboratory education cannot and 
should not be closed.  

Taking this crisis into consideration, why, then, is a movement under way 
to shut the door on a program that has trained laboratory professionals 
for over 30 years? The program is the catalyst to supplying the clinical 
laboratory scientists and medical technologists not only in North 
Carolina, but also in Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina. Why is it 
deemed unworthy to continue its tradition of providing quality education 
to students who have job prospects after graduation? 

After all:
* The nation's laboratory workforce is retiring.
* An aging U.S. population will create a greater need for laboratory 
services. * Rural hospitals, such as those in western North Carolina, will 
be impacted first by the time bombs that are the CLS workforce shortage 
and the retiring baby-boomers. * The threat to WCU's CLS program is but 
one of a slew of laboratory education programs being closed.

†As a laboratory professional and director of a clinical laboratory in an 
underserved area of the country, I can attest to the critical shortage of 
talent in the allied medical health field. This comes at a time when their 
presence in health care is MOST needed due to the complexity of the 
medical sciences and the aging of the American populace. I strongly advise 
you to keep the education opportunities open for those seeking to enter 
the field. In so doing you are helping to serve and save many patients' 
lives.
