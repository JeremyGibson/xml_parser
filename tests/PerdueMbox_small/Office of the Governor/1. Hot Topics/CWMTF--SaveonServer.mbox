Re:  Include substantial funding for land and water protection in your
budget proposal
Dear Governor Perdue,
Thank you for championing the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and
other conservation funding. Your support has allowed Catawba Lands
Conservancy to conserve important natural treasures in North Carolina,
such as 3,242 acres of critical riparian lands along the South Fork
River that help protect Charlotte Metro Areaís water quality and
quantity.
I believe healthy and abundant natural resources are a critical
foundation of our state's economy - particularly agriculture and
tourism, our top two industries. According to Dee Freeman, Secretary of
Environment and Natural Resources, outdoor and wildlife-related
recreation brings an estimated annual economic benefit of $4.3 billion,
while North Carolinaís agriculture and forestry resources have an
estimated $70.8 billion economic impact.  While you are forced to
prioritize funding in these uncertain economic times, please remember
direct conservation funding is less than one-half of one percent of our
state's budget.  As lead agency for the Carolina Thread Trail, Catawba
Lands Conservancy ensures conservation of natural lands, directly
preserves water quality and quantity, and provides recreation and vital
connection of fifteen counties.  Natural lands provide many benefits
that can lead to improved environmental quality and human health,
including improvements in water and air quality, richer wildlife
habitat, and areas attractive to new businesses and industry.  This
ìgreen infrastructureî provides all North Carolina citizens and
visitors a source of quality, inexpensive recreation that connects them
with nature.
Your leadership will guide us during these difficult economic times.
Please maintain full funding for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund
at $100 million and include $15 million a year for the Agricultural
Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in your budget
proposal. We must also maintain the existing dedicated revenue sources
for the Natural Heritage and Parks and Recreation trust funds.

By continuing to support our conservation trust funds, you will
continue to protect and create jobs in North Carolina, and help
preserve our state's quality of life. The decisions we make today
create our legacy for tomorrow. Sincerely,

Hannah-Marie Warfle (UNC Chapel-Hill)

I know you must balance the budget and I applaud your work to look at things a different way. These are challenging times.



I know you are getting ready to decide budget priorities. I hope you will keep funding the Clean Water Management Trust Fund. Our state has had such rapid growth that we need these dollars to protect our drinking water. Please do not cut the funding for this key initiative. Land conservation is like savings. We have not saved enough as individuals and as governments. We now need to save and protect our precious land.

*/Re: Include substantial funding for land and water protection in your
budget proposal/*

Dear Governor Perdue,

Thank you for championing the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and
other conservation funding. Your support has allowed Catawba Lands
Conservancy to conserve important natural treasures in North Carolina,
such as 3,242 acres of critical riparian lands along the South Fork
River that help protect Charlotte Metro Areaís water quality and quantity.

I believe healthy and abundant natural resources are a critical
foundation of our state's economy - particularly agriculture and
tourism, our top two industries. According to Dee Freeman, Secretary of
Environment and Natural Resources, outdoor and wildlife-related
recreation brings an estimated annual economic benefit of $4.3 billion,
while North Carolinaís agriculture and forestry resources have an
estimated $70.8 billion economic impact/. /*While you are forced to
prioritize funding in these uncertain economic times, please remember
direct conservation funding is less than one-half of one percent of our
state's budget. *

As lead agency for the Carolina Thread Trail, Catawba Lands Conservancy
ensures conservation of natural lands, directly preserves water quality
and quantity, and provides recreation and vital connection of fifteen
counties. Natural lands provide many benefits that can lead to improved
environmental quality and human health, including improvements in water
and air quality, richer wildlife habitat, and areas attractive to new
businesses and industry. This ìgreen infrastructureî provides all North
Carolina citizens and visitors a source of quality, inexpensive
recreation that connects them with nature.

Your leadership will guide us during these difficult economic times.
*Please maintain full funding for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund
at $100 million and include $15 million a year for the Agricultural
Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in your budget
proposal. We must also maintain the existing dedicated revenue sources
for the Natural Heritage and Parks and Recreation trust funds.*

*
By continuing to support our conservation trust funds, you will continue
to protect and create jobs in North Carolina, and help preserve our
state's quality of life. The decisions we make today create our legacy
for tomorrow. *

Sincerely,

John Scavetto

According to Dee Freeman, Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, outdoor and wildlife-related recreation brings an estimated annual economic benefit of $4.3 billion, while North Carolina‚Äôs agriculture and forestry resources have an estimated $70.8 billion economic impact. †While you are forced to prioritize funding in these uncertain economic times, please remember direct conservation funding is less than one-half of one percent of our state's budget. †

As lead agency for the Carolina Thread Trail, Catawba Lands Conservancy ensures conservation of natural lands, directly preserves water quality and quantity, and provides recreation and vital connection of fifteen counties. †Natural lands provide many benefits that can lead to improved environmental quality and human health, including improvements in water and air quality, richer wildlife habitat, and areas attractive to new businesses and industry. †This ‚Äúgreen infrastructure‚Äù provides all North Carolina citizens and visitors a source of quality, inexpensive recreation that connects them with nature.

Your leadership will guide us during these difficult economic times. Please maintain full funding for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund at $100 million and include $15 million a year for the Agricultural Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in your budget proposal. We must also maintain the existing dedicated revenue sources for the Natural Heritage and Parks and Recreation trust funds.

By continuing to support our conservation trust funds, you will continue to protect and create jobs in North Carolina, and help preserve our state's quality of life. The decisions we make today create our legacy for tomorrow.

Sincerely,

38 acres along Crowders Creek (which flows into the Catawba River
supplying drinking water for thousands of people) is protected on
former family property now owned by the Catawba Lands Conservancy,
made possible by money from the NC Clean Water Management Trust Fund.

Land and water conservation is not a luxury but essential to our
public health and economic security. I am attaching a letter to
Governor Purdue urging her to protect funding for CLMTF.

Re:† Include substantial funding for land and water protection in your budget proposal

Dear†Governor Perdue,

Thank you for championing the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and other conservation funding. Your support has allowed Catawba Lands Conservancy to conserve important natural treasures in North Carolina, such as 3,242 acres of critical riparian lands along the South Fork River that help protect Charlotte Metro Areaís water quality and quantity.

I believe healthy and abundant natural resources are a critical foundation of our state's economy - particularly agriculture and tourism, our top two industries. According to Dee Freeman, Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, outdoor and wildlife-related recreation brings an estimated annual economic benefit of $4.3 billion, while North Carolinaís agriculture and forestry resources have an estimated $70.8 billion economic impact.† While you are forced to prioritize funding in these uncertain economic times, please remember direct conservation funding is less than one-half of one percent of our state's budget.†

As lead agency for the Carolina Thread Trail, Catawba Lands Conservancy ensures conservation of natural lands, directly preserves water quality and quantity, and provides recreation and vital connection of fifteen counties.† Natural lands provide many benefits that can lead to improved environmental quality and human health, including improvements in water and air quality, richer wildlife habitat, and areas attractive to new businesses and industry.† This ìgreen infrastructureî provides all North Carolina citizens and visitors a source of quality, inexpensive recreation that connects them with nature.

Your leadership will guide us during these difficult economic times. Please maintain full funding for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund at $100 million and include $15 million a year for the Agricultural Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in your budget proposal. We must also maintain the existing dedicated revenue sources for the Natural Heritage and Parks and Recreation trust funds.


By continuing to support our conservation trust funds, you will continue to protect and create jobs in North Carolina, and help preserve our state's quality of life. The decisions we make today create our legacy for tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Given the projected shortfall I am well aware of the difficult program
decisions
you will have to make in the near future.
A couple of suggestions to be explored by staff.States have the option
of sharing OSHA responsibilities with USDOL
OSHA.Federal takes care of the private sector;state the public
sector.This could
prove more effective and less costly.
 Some states,Vermont for one,have all but
eliminated their tax revenue departments by simply collecting a
percentage of the
individuals federal tax as the state tax.
Owe Washngton $10,000 owe Vermont
28% of it or $2800.No complicated forms,no bureaucracy.
Now that I've solved all your problems
please do me one favor.Provide sufficient funding for CWMTF so all of
our grandchildren will have clean water to drink.
Thanks and every sucess to you.

Please maintain full funding for the Clean Water Management Trust Fund at $100 million and include $15 million a year for the Agricultural Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in your budget proposal. We must also maintain the existing dedicated revenue sources for the Natural Heritage and Parks and Recreation trust funds.

By continuing to support our conservation trust funds, you will continue to protect and create jobs in North Carolina, and help preserve our state's quality of life. The decisions we make today create our legacy for tomorrow.
Sincerely,
