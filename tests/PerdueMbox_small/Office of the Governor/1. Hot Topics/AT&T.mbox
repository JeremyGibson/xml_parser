Dear Governor Perdue,

AT&T is using the economic crisis created by Wall Street to
defend their greed in demanding more concessions from working
people. The company's net income in 2008 rose 7.7 % to $12.9
billion. Despite the recession, in the first quarter of 2009,
AT&T's net income was $3.1 billion.

Consumers depend on the workers who ARE the AT&T network. They
take great pride in the quality of their work, helping each and
every customer. Union members play an integral role in AT&T's
ascent to its position as a solid telecommunications and
broadband competitor.

Despite their solid financial position, AT&T is demanding that
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the
Communication Workers of America members and retirees hold the
line on wages, and agree to bear huge increases in their health
care costs. Until there is a comprehensive national solution,
simply throwing workers and retirees into the ranks of the
underinsured will not well serve our Nation or our individual
communities.

During these fragile economic conditions, a strong corporation
like AT&T should be leading the way, showing how America can
grow jobs, build communities, and achieve guaranteed health care
for everyone. Now is not the time to insist on a reduction in
health care coverage from workers and retirees. Good health
benefits create a stronger middle class, and that is good for
everyone.

I ask your support in urging AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson to
direct his negotiators to show the level of good corporate
citizenship that was once expected of those who built
profitable, successful businesses in our Nation. Please mail a
letter to Mr. Stephenson at 208 South Akard St, Suite 3700,
Dallas TX 75202. Tell him, "Enough is enough" the middle class
is already taking a beating in this economy, without companies
like AT&T taking a bite out of its worker's standard of living."

Dear Governor Perdue,

AT&T is using the economic crisis created by Wall Street to
defend their greed in demanding more concessions from working
people. The company's net income in 2008 rose 7.7 % to $12.9
billion. Despite the recession, in the first quarter of 2009,
AT&T's net income was $3.1 billion.

Consumers depend on the workers who ARE the AT&T network. They
take great pride in the quality of their work, helping each and
every customer. Union members play an integral role in AT&T's
ascent to its position as a solid telecommunications and
broadband competitor.

Despite their solid financial position, AT&T is demanding that
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the
Communication Workers of America members and retirees hold the
line on wages, and agree to bear huge increases in their health
care costs. Until there is a comprehensive national solution,
simply throwing workers and retirees into the ranks of the
underinsured will not well serve our Nation or our individual
communities.

During these fragile economic conditions, a strong corporation
like AT&T should be leading the way, showing how America can
grow jobs, build communities, and achieve guaranteed health care
for everyone. Now is not the time to insist on a reduction in
health care coverage from workers and retirees. Good health
benefits create a stronger middle class, and that is good for
everyone.

I ask your support in urging AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson to
direct his negotiators to show the level of good corporate
citizenship that was once expected of those who built
profitable, successful businesses in our Nation. Please mail a
letter to Mr. Stephenson at 208 South Akard St, Suite 3700,
Dallas TX 75202. Tell him, "Enough is enough" the middle class
is already taking a beating in this economy, without companies
like AT&T taking a bite out of its worker's standard of living."

Visitor: Mr. Dennis Lewis

Address: 304 S Claiborne St, Goldsboro, NC 27530

Email: dalobl@bellsouth.net

Subject: Beach Plan

Comment: Dennis Lewis 304 S Claiborne St Goldsboro, NC 27530-5308 June 19, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support legislation to prevent a major Beach Plan bailout. Reform legislation is needed to prevent a major bailout of the Beach Plan, the state-backed insurance provider for high risk coastal properties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.6 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.66 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents by: - Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development and employment. - Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all North Carolina residents. Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm. If approved, the Beach Plan reform legislation would help stabilize the state�s coastal insurer by allowing it to build its reserves, purchase the necessary financial products to ensure solvency and allow it to fully pay its claims after a storm. Over the long-term, the legislation will also begin reducing the size of the Beach Plan, to reduce the risk it has placed on the state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support legislation to fix the Beach Plan. Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Sincerely, Dennis A Lewis 919-735-6623 Dennis Lewis sent this message using the Capwiz�XC system on the PCI Web site. To learn more about PCI's issues, please visit http://www.capwiz.com/pci2/ .
