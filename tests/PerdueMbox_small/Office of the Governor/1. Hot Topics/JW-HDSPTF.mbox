Subject: Support the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As your constituent I write to you today to recognize the good work of the Justus-Warren Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force (JW-HDSPTF) and urge you to continue to support its' funding. The JW-HDSPTF, established in 1995, has funded programs that have helped to reduce death rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 1998, the first Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding became available for state Heart Disease and Prevention programs. Because of the activities of the Task Force and the availability of required state match, NC was one of the first states to be funded by the CDC. The JW-HDSPTF has helped to lay a successful foundation for healthier lives in North Carolina. I realize that our state is facing tough economic times and that you are facing tough decisions; but now is not the time to cut the programs that invest in the health of our citizens. Heart Disease remains the number one killer followed by stroke as the third leading causes of death in North Carolina. North Carolina needs to continue to take the steps to building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular disease and stroke by continuing to support the task force and its' funding needs. Thank you! Barbara Rayborn Sincerely, Barbara Rayborn 1551 Montclair Ln Creedmoor, NC 27522-8251

We need to ensure that other women do not die by being misdiagnosed like my best friend who was only 40. This funding will bring the awareness to the public of these diseases.

Subject: Support the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As your constituent I write to you today to recognize the good work of the Justus-Warren Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force (JW-HDSPTF) and urge you to continue to support its' funding. The JW-HDSPTF, established in 1995, has funded programs that have helped to reduce death rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 1998, the first Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding became available for state Heart Disease and Prevention programs. Because of the activities of the Task Force and the availability of required state match, NC was one of the first states to be funded by the CDC. The JW-HDSPTF has helped to lay a successful foundation for healthier lives in North Carolina. I realize that our state is facing tough economic times and that you are facing tough decisions; but now is not the time to cut the programs that invest in the health of our citizens. Heart Disease remains the number one killer followed by stroke as the third leading causes of death in North Carolina. North Carolina needs to continue to take the steps to building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular disease and stroke by continuing to support the task force and its' funding needs. Thank you! Christina Malinky Sincerely, Christina Malinky 4028 Bannockburn Pl Apt L Charlotte, NC 28211-4573

Subject: Support the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As your constituent I write to you today to recognize the good work of the Justus-Warren Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force (JW-HDSPTF) and urge you to continue to support its' funding. The JW-HDSPTF, established in 1995, has funded programs that have helped to reduce death rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 1998, the first Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding became available for state Heart Disease and Prevention programs. Because of the activities of the Task Force and the availability of required state match, NC was one of the first states to be funded by the CDC. The JW-HDSPTF has helped to lay a successful foundation for healthier lives in North Carolina. I realize that our state is facing tough economic times and that you are facing tough decisions; but now is not the time to cut the programs that invest in the health of our citizens. Heart Disease remains the number one killer followed by stroke as the third leading causes of death in North Carolina. North Carolina needs to continue to take the steps to building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular disease and stroke by continuing to support the task force and its' funding needs. Thank you! kim miller Sincerely, kim miller PO Box 1396 145 boyd st Winterville, NC 28590-1396

Subject: Support the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, As your constituent I write to you today to recognize the good work of the Justus-Warren Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force (JW-HDSPTF) and urge you to continue to support its' funding. The JW-HDSPTF, established in 1995, has funded programs that have helped to reduce death rates from cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 1998, the first Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding became available for state Heart Disease and Prevention programs. Because of the activities of the Task Force and the availability of required state match, NC was one of the first states to be funded by the CDC. The JW-HDSPTF has helped to lay a successful foundation for healthier lives in North Carolina. I realize that our state is facing tough economic times and that you are facing tough decisions; but now is not the time to cut the programs that invest in the health of our citizens. Heart Disease remains the number one killer followed by stroke as the third leading causes of death in North Carolina. North Carolina needs to continue to take the steps to building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular disease and stroke by continuing to support the task force and its' funding needs. Thank you! Judy Hilles Sincerely, Judy Hilles 1800 Violet Hill Ln Raleigh, NC 27610-8252
