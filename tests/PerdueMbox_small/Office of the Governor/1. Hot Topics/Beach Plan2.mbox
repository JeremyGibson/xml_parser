Subject: House Bill 1305

Comment: P. P. Pilcher, Jr. 1811 Rosewood Drive Greenville, NC 27858-4449 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by supporting House Bill 1305. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that �by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.� Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims? Without reform right now, a major hurricane hitting North Carolina would ultimately cost all North Carolina residents by: -Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development, and employment. -Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555. In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 would help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. Please consider the views of the North Carolina residents and support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Sincerely, P. P. Pilcher, Jr. 2523553874 P. P.

Subject: Fix The Beach Insurance Plan

Comment: Thomas Scharf 1032 Woodkirk Ln. Matthews, NC 28104-8053 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by supporting House Bill 1305. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that �by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.� Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims? Without reform right now, a major hurricane hitting North Carolina would ultimately cost all North Carolina residents by: -Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development, and employment. -Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555. In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 would help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. Please consider the views of the North Carolina residents and support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan. Sincerely, Thomas J.

It is not fair and just for all of North Carolina's citizen's to subsidize the insurance on the mostly second homes of beachfront property owners, many of whom are not North Carolina citizens. Beach and soundfront construction is already out of control and difficult to manage for coastal municipalities; subsidizing insurance just encourages more risky construction. Subsidizing such construction through artifically low insurance on the backs of the majority of North Carolinians who can only dream of owning such real estate is unconsciounable.

Comment: Artie Averette 5135 Moriah Rd. Rougemont, NC 27572-8346 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by supporting House Bill 1305. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that ?by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.? Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims? Without reform right now, a major hurricane hitting North Carolina would ultimately cost all North Carolina residents by: -Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development, and employment. -Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555. In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 would help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state.

Subject: FIX HB 1305

Comment: Byron Bateman 2283 Chinquapin Rd Farmville, NC 27828-9226 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by ammending House Bill 1305 to ensure that the owners of property along the coast pay the full amount required to insure their own liabilities. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that ?by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.? Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims?

A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555. In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 could, if properly crafted,help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. In summary, average citizens across this state did not create the situation that currently exists whereby an extremely dense grouping of high end structures and real estate has been located in an area that will inevitably be impacted by a major storm. We did not create it nor do we benefit from it. For example, I cannot park a car at these homes and businesses when I wish to visit a public beach. Instead, I have to hunt for parking, and probably pay for it, as well. The fishing piers that used to offer so many people an opportunity for recreation have been torn down in favor of condos and "rental machines." Inlets have been also been moved to protect these structures at an exorbitant, but often hidden cost to the public. And now the priveleged owners expect the whole state to soak up the difference between what is paid into the broken system as opposed to what will be owed when (not if) a major storm hits our coast. Please consider the views of the North Carolina residents and FIX House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan.

Subject: House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan

Comment: Kris McCarn 1549 Sink Rd Lexington, NC 27295-8420 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by supporting House Bill 1305. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that �by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.� Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims? Without reform right now, a major hurricane hitting North Carolina would ultimately cost all North Carolina residents by: -Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development, and employment. -Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555. In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 would help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. Please consider the views of the North Carolina residents and support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan.

In a time of recession, North Carolina government and residents alike cannot handle these grave financial implications. House Bill 1305 would help ensure that the Beach Plan has the appropriate financial resources to pay claims, provide a strategy for the Beach Plan to minimize the financial impact of a large storm, and preserve the availability of homeowners insurance across the entire state. Please consider the views of the North Carolina residents and support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan.

Subject: Please Fix The Beach Plan

Comment: Bill Merritt 136 Southwood Park Rd. Mooresville, NC 28117-7490 July 24, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing to you concerning the severely under funded Beach Plan insurance program. As you know, the House has already supported House Bill 1305 and now it is up to the Senate to fix the Beach Plan. I ask you to please prevent skyrocketing insurance rates for North Carolina citizens and a potential insurance crisis by supporting House Bill 1305. The flaws in the original Beach Plan are clear. An article in Ashvilles Citizen-Times on this legislation highlights the fact that our coast has recently seen a great burst in high-end construction. The article states that �by late last year, about 22,000 of the 166,000 residential buildings covered by the plan had a value of more than $700,000.� Which begs the question, how does this program plan to insure these properties when the Beach Plan is only equipped to pay $1.66 billion in claims? Without reform right now, a major hurricane hitting North Carolina would ultimately cost all North Carolina residents by: -Disrupting the insurance market which could have statewide impact on banking, real estate, economic development, and employment. -Driving up insurance rates. A recent study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for all residents. Ultimately, if this shortfall were covered by state funding, it could end up costing every North Carolina taxpayer $1,555.

Normally, I believe that the "haves" among us should help out the "have nots". But it appears to me that, currently, a lot of in-land people are at risk of helping coastal residents in the event of a major storm. Many of us in-landers abhor the idea of paying to repair vacation homes of those fortunate enough to own them. If one can afford to own a beach home, then one should be able to assume the risk of continuing to own it. Please support House Bill 1305 to fix the Beach Plan.
