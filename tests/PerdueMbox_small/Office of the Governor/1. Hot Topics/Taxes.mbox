Dear Governor,
     The growing of good North Carolina grapes and the production of delicious North Carolina wine is one of the bright spots in the recession facing our North Carolina farmers.  Many folks are converting their land from tobacco to grapes.  In my beloved Duplin County alone there are at least five new farmers planting grapes this Spring.
      Last year alone Duplin paid its 55 growers $2.8 million for their grapes;  whereas we paid the State and Federal Government $3.2 million.  Already taxes on grapes and wine are far too high.  These figures did not include the project additional 6.5% sales tax on Duplin's wine sales - projected to have generated another $1.5 million dollars.   Just think how much better our grape growers would have faired if these figures were reversed.
     North Carolina wine is not a "Sin" and should not be included in the "Sin Tax" mind set.
     Thank you for your continued support of North Carolina's growing grape industry.
     Thank you for your consideration.
With warmest personal regards,

David G. Fussell, Sr.

Subject: Reject the National Firearm Licensing Propoasal

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would like to request that you ask our NC Senators and Legislators to propose to you the same memorial the Idaho has aske of its Governor to sign. I believe this would send a clear message to the the US Seanators and Congressman how we here in North Carolina feel about our rights under the Second Amendment. It has long been understood the the police and sheriff officers across the US have no direct law that states they must protect you from harm. Even if they were required to prtect each citizen, we as American could not afford our taxes to support such a numerous staff. Therefore, it is every law abiding citizens right and duty to protect their self and families form crimminals. I hope that you will take a stance with me on this issue. I appreciate your willingness to take the time to listen to your voters. Thanks!!!

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #708] Please eliminate the proposed 5% sales tax increase on North Carolina
 wine

Dear Governor Perdue,

Our names are Marek Wojciechowski and Jill Winkler. As owners and 
operators of Chatham Hill Winery, an urban winery located in the 
Triangle, we would like to express our deepest concern about the serious 
consequences that the proposed 5% sales tax increase on wine.  This 
increase will be disastrous on us and many small businesses in our State 
that directly or indirectly depend on the ability to grow grapes and 
produce wine in North Carolina, an industry that has grown exponentially 
over the last ten years and is proud to contribute over $1 billion in 
economic impact on the state’s economy ($813.3 million according to the 
2005 study conducted by MKF Research).

Due to the depressed economy and over 10% unemployment in our area, we 
see continuous decline in sales of wines produced by Chatham Hill and 
when speaking to our colleagues understand they experience similar 
difficulties.  We as well as wine shops, restaurants, and other 
businesses serving in-state and out-of state tourists and business 
visitors face serious declines in revenues which puts us under the same 
debilitating financial pressures as other businesses within the state.

The proposed 5% tax increase on wine sales can only add to the hardship 
that we and the above mentioned businesses are already facing. If the 5% 
tax is implemented our sales will further decline and our North Carolina 
grape growers, come the 2009 harvest in August-September will face 
reduced demand for their fruit which will jeopardize their ability to 
sustain many of their vineyard operations. All of the above will result 
in business closings, layoffs and further reduction in tax revenues 
(e.g., payroll, income, excise, sales taxes) that our wine industry and 
associated industries contribute to the state and local governments. 
Chatham Hill Winery and many other small businesses whose livelihood 
depend on wine sales are struggling to continue each day with the drop 
in business we have all experienced over the last year.

Chatham Hill Winery is a small family-owned and operated business, as is 
most of the over 80 wineries and 450 vineyards located around the state. 
  This is our livelihood and our lives; we do not have other sources of 
income.  All we have has gone into our dream of creating a wonderful 
product based upon the state’s strong agricultural foundation. We fear 
that implementation of the 5% tax increase on wine that is proposed will 
jeopardize our ability to sustain our businesses until the economy turns 
around.

On behalf of Chatham Hill Winery, our employees, our grape growers, our 
wine distributors and wine retailers, our North Carolina suppliers of 
bottles, corks and cellar reagents, and all small businesses that depend 
on the continued growth and success of the North Carolina wine industry, 
please, please reconsider and eliminate your proposed 5% tax on wine.

We appreciate your consideration and cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
Marek Wojciechowski & Jill Winkler
Chatham Hill Winery
Cary/Morrisville, NC

Hello.
My name is Kimberley Ladue and I am writing in regard to my tax refund. I filed my taxes in early February and since 2/19/09, my tax refund has been "processed". I have spoken to the the tax department who, while cordial and helpful, said that the refund was in the system but they could not tell me when I would receive MY money, MY refund. There were very helpful and very apologetic.
They said that they could not tell me when I would receive my check.
It is my money.
And I need it desparately.
If I owed the state of NC money and they called me and asked for it and I said, as I was told, "I have it. I have no idea when you will get it. I can't refer you to anyone who can tell you when you will get it. I can not tell you if ti will be next week or next month or next year. Please check back.", I would be in jail.
Please help me.
THis is my money. I need my money.
Thank you-

Dear Governor Perdue,



This letter is to ask you to please reconsider and eliminate the proposed 5% sales tax on North Carolina wine.  It is our opinion that this proposed sales tax would be disastrous to the North Carolina wine industry.  The proposed 5% sales tax increase on wine would be an extreme hardship on the wineries and would affect other industries such as restaurants, hotels, Bed & Breakfasts, gas stations, etc.  In talking to the wineries in our area everyone is in agreement that the economic situation has drastically affected sales.  An increase in sales tax would certainly be a factor in whether some wineries could survive in this economic climate.



North Carolina is home to 80+ wineries and over 400 vineyards.  A very large majority of these wineries and vineyards are small, family-owned businesses and is their sole source of income.  The wine industry has grown over the last ten years with over 5700 jobs created.  The annual economic impact of the NC wine and grape industry is $813 Million, according to a recent study.  Because of its growth, we get tourist from various states.  These tourist also visit nearby restaurants, stay at hotels and B&Bs, purchase fuel for their cars, and shop in local stores.  If the wineries start closing this would affect t the amount of tourism dollars these tours bring into NC.



As everyone knows the unemployment rate in NC is now over 10%, the wine industry has seen a recent decline in sales just as other industries have seen a decline.  To impose additional taxes on NC wines would cause an additional decline in sales for restaurants, wine shops and other businesses.  This proposed 5% tax increase on wine sales can only add to the hardship we as small business owners face everyday.  This would cause our sales to further decline and would affect the many grape growers who depend on their harvest to sustain their vineyards.  This tax would result in business closings, layoffs and further reduction in the tax revenues by reducing payroll, income, excise taxes, and sales taxes that our wineries and associated industries contribute to the state and local governments. 



On behalf of Lake James Cellars owners, employees, grape growers, wine retailers, restaurants, suppliers to the NC wine industry and all small businesses that depend on the continued growth and success of the NC wine industry, please reconsider and eliminate the proposed 5% tax on wine.



Thank you for your consideration and cooperation,

Mike and Betty Fowler

                        A user with email address of jonbarlow82@aol.com submitted the following question. 



                        Instead of taxing the tabacco and spirits to prevent health issues.  Why not get rid of it altogether? Taxing is not a correct way to approach this issue! To make this a negitive for the people while making it a positive for government is to condone the same products you intend to punish. What message are you trying to spred? " That "We" don't feel this is good for you, but good enough to provide it in retail markets and profit off. With all the laws being pass to segregate PEOPLE that are addicted to a product your state approves is marketable, how do you stand by your view when it is clear that its wrong. I am very disappointed with your days in office for many of reasons but this is the most contradicting set of laws and taxes I have ever seen.  By the way, I am not tabacco user nor do I support the substance but this is clearly an attempt to discriminate a group of people. My question to you is if you believe your right on this, then do you also see that you are responiable for making this available in your state knowing the health risks, should you be able to be held to the courts by law suits just as the companies themself for selling the product?

Subject: NHTSA Report Refutes Gov. Perdue's Assertions About Speeding Motorists

Over the last two weeks, Gov. Bev Perdue has been harassing the citizens of NC by DEMANDING overzealous speed enforcement by the NCSHP. Last week I traveled from Hickory to Asheville via I-40 and saw TWENTY ONE vehicles that had been pulled over! On a normal day, I might see five vehicles pulled over on the same trip. Sadly, the local roads near Hickory are no different. I'm personally aware of at least one individual being ticketed for going 3 MPH over, yes that's right, just 3 MPH over the posted speed limit during this "safety crackdown".

  Gov. Perdue recently stated that  "North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,"  "Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. "

THE PROBLEM WITH THAT STATEMENT IS THAT IT IS VERIFIABLY FALSE!!!!

  Here are the facts, according to a recent National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey conducted by NHTSA and published in July 2008, it was concluded that only 5%, you read that right, ONLY 5% of all highway crashes were a direct result of excessive speed. This statistic can be found in the chart on page 23 of the NHTSA report. It lists "Travelling Too Fast" at 5%.
Here are the links to those two studies.One is an article about the study and the second is a link to the actual NHTSA study itself.

http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/26/2627.asp , http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811059.PDF

  It is also known that the DOT purposely sets the speed limits 10 mph TOO SLOW on most roadways. The reasoning is that this will actually result in the ideal speed being maintained. The problem though is that when someone is stopped for going 11 mph over the speed limit they are in reality only going ONE mph over the ideal speed limit.

  I believe it is WRONG for Gov. Perdue to enlarge the state coffers by ordering the NCSHP to aggresively harass motorists, thereby causing NC citizens to resent the very department charged with enforcing public safety. Our NCSHP troopers are the best in the land. If they actually believed that mild speeding on our interstates really caused accidents, then they would operate with the same enforcement levels EVERYDAY of the year that they have exhibited over the past two weeks. The fact that they do not speaks volumes about Gov. Perdue's crackdown on NC motorists.

  As shown by the NTHSA report, this issue is actually NOT about safety at all but about raising revenue for the state. The problem is that they are getting this money from many people who have lost jobs and are least able to afford the exorbitant fines and increased insurance premiums.

  I don't know how many insurance company executives and representatives have donated money to Gov. Perdue during this last election cycle. However, I'm sure they are very appreciative of the increased income that they will derive from NC citizens by charging their policy holders higher rates over the next three years. And all because they simply dared to go 66 mph on a posted 55 mph interstate, that was originally designed for 80 mph over 50 years ago.

  Please talk with Gov. Perdue and tell her that if she wants to raise taxes, then please have the guts to do so via the state assembly. Increasing state revenue by harassing motorists and turning our esteemed NCSHP into the equivalent of a mob enforcement collection agency is not the right path to her desired second term in office.

Sincerely, Norman Simpers Jr., Conover,NC

Dear Governor Perdue,



We are disappointed as you are about the Miley Cyrus film being relocated to Georgia. We are the owners of one of a few homes on Wrightsville Beach that was being considered as the primary filming location for The Last Song. Even though we live in Georgia, we were very excited about the NC film. They had even talked to my daughter who lives in Wilmington about working with them on this project.



My husband spoke today to one of the producers, who called to explain why the location was being moved to Georgia. He said the difference in incentives was about $1 million. I think that is a small amount of money in comparison to the impact on the NC economy. I believe that NC would make up the amount in income tax and other taxes that would be gained. I think it would be a great idea to try and get the NC tax incentives raised!!!



I know that you have the same idea, but I wanted to let you know that the difference was only $1 million!!

                        It has been over 45 days since the State accepted my e-file and it still has not been paid.  The State collects my taxes on time each week and each purchase.  Why am I waiting so long to get the money the state owes me?  This should be the priority of the state to stimulate the economy in NC.  NC actually tracted me down in CT for owing $14 one year, but it can't pay me on time!  When can we exspect our payment?

                        A user with email address of kstoehr@nc.rr.com submitted the following question. 



                        I had my taxes done in February and I realize you are running 4 weeks behind, wich is well behind me now. Where is our joint tax credit? I am a hard working teacher and so is my husband. With this economy it is not right to make us wait so long. In fact, it is cruel. Please let me know when we will receive our check. Hardworking people of NC are  suffering and your people need to do something about, especially when we try to do everything right, pay on time, support the governor, etc. If we started talking about our healthcare - well that is off the charts of misery. So we are relying on our tax credit to pay for RX and food and living. Please have a heart and notify me with good news.

CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION MOVING IN THE HOUSE –
HOUSE TRANSPORTATION & INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE OFFERS TIMELINE FOR CONSIDERATION OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZATION BILL-
AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ENERGY GRANTS NOW AVAILABLE

House Climate Change Bill Under Development;
APTA Members Urged to Contact Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee!

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is holding a series of hearings this week in preparation for the Energy and Environment Subcommittee markup of the "American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009,”  the draft climate legislation sponsored by Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey (D-MA).   The draft bill proposes a new cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, and it includes a section that would establish emission reductions goals for the transportation sector (Sec. 841, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions Through Transportation Efficiency). 

The current draft bill does not assign any revenue from emissions allowance auctions or make any other funding decisions, but that could change soon.   The Energy and Environment Subcommittee is expected to hold its markup during the week of April 27, and committee leaders could begin making funding decisions this week.

APTA President Bill Millar sent a letter to Chairman Waxman asking that 10 percent of emission allowance revenue be dedicated to investment in public transportation and other emission-reducing transportation infrastructure.  A copy of the letter can be found <http://www.mmsend1.com/ls.cfm?r=53279331&sid=6399926&m=716308&u=APTA&s=http://www.magnetmail.net/images/clients/APTA/attach/APTA_letter_Waxman_4_22_09.pdf> here.  The APTA Intergovernmental Issues Subcommittee and APTA staff have also developed a set of “Discussion Principles” to highlight transit industry priorities under a cap-and-trade program.  To view the principles, click <http://www.mmsend1.com/ls.cfm?r=53279331&sid=6399927&m=716308&u=APTA&s=http://www.magnetmail.net/images/clients/APTA/attach/APTA_Discussion_Principles_4_7_09.pdf> here. 












ACTION ALERT:

APTA urges its members to immediately contact members of the committee that represent your agency, business, or region, including Chairman Waxman and Subcommittee Chairman Markey.  When you talk to members of the committee, please ask the following:

* Urge the Committee to dedicate no less than 10 percent of allowance revenue created under a cap-and-trade program to investment in public transportation and transportation infrastructure that reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
* Explain that transportation is responsible for one-third of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and that current public transportation use already saves 4.2 billion gallons of fuel and prevents the emission of 37 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually.
* Ask that revenue derived from transportation fuels under a cap-and-trade program be reinvested in transportation infrastructure.
* Request that climate change legislation provide assistance to public transportation to offset increases in the cost of fuel and electricity under a cap-and-trade program in order to prevent service reductions.  Transit systems are exempt federal motor fuels taxes, and this principle should be extended to climate change legislation.

House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee Working on Surface Transportation Authorization Bill

House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman James Oberstar (D-MN) has set a tentative timeline for consideration of the next surface transportation authorization bill, to replace the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century – A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which expires on September 30, 2009.  The Chairman and his staff have indicated that the committee plans to complete a draft of the legislation by mid-May for consideration by the full committee prior to the Memorial Day recess, which begins on May 29.  The Chairman then hopes to have the legislation on the House floor sometime in mid-June.  Although these dates are subject to change, the timeline signals the committee’s commitment to moving this legislation soon.  Committee staff have indicated that they are currently in the process of drafting the legislation.  Few details of the content of the Chairman’s bill are available at this time, and it is unclear when the Ways and Means Committee will begin moving a financing title.  Chairman Oberstar has sent a letter to House Members asking for the submission of project requests and legislative language prior to May 8.  In the meantime, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood has indicated that the Administration is developing a set of principles for the authorization bill, which will be released in the near future.  APTA will provide more information as it becomes available.   


 ACTION ALERT:

APTA urges all members to arrange meetings with your Representatives and Senators to brief them on APTA’s Recommendations for Federal Surface Transportation Authorization Legislation.  The recommendations can be found <http://www.mmsend1.com/ls.cfm?r=53279331&sid=6399928&m=716308&u=APTA&s=http://www.apta.com/research/info/online/post_safetea_lu.cfm> here.

Remind your legislators that the authorization legislation should provide no less than $123 billion for public transportation over the six year authorization period.

Explain to your legislators that APTA, along with several of its coalition partners and the two commissions chartered under SAFETEA-LU, strongly support an increase in the motor fuels user fee to finance growth in the transit and surface transportation programs.

Explain to your legislators the importance of completing the authorization bill prior to the expiration of SAFETEA-LU on September 30, so that transit systems can continue to make uninterrupted investments to meet growing demand and continue to realize the national benefits that public transportation delivers.
FTA Issues Grant Guidance for the Transit Investments for Greenhouse Gas and Energy  (TIGGER) Program

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has published guidance and grant application instructions for the Transit Investments for Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reduction (TIGGER) Grant Program.   Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), Congress made $100 million available to public transit agencies for capital investments to assist in reducing energy consumption and/or greenhouse gas emissions.  Examples of these investment include replacement of existing buses with more energy efficient models (hybrid, fuel cell), conversion to more efficient control technology vehicles and construction or rehabilitation of transit system facilities.  Grants may range from $2 million to $25 million, and transit agencies may apply together to reach minimum funding threshold requirements.  The application deadline for this program is May 29, 2009.  For additional FTA grant guidance, click <http://www.mmsend1.com/ls.cfm?r=53279331&sid=6399929&m=716308&u=APTA&s=http://www.fta.dot.gov/index_9326.html#TIGGER> here.

U.S. Department of Energy Issues Grant Guidance for ARRA State and Local Block Grants, Alternative Fueled Vehicles Pilot Grant Program and Transportation Electrification Program

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently published guidance on the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program, funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). 

The ARRA appropriated $3.2 Billion for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program within the U.S. Department of Energy.   The program was authorized in Title V, Subtitle E of the Energy Independence and Security (EISA) Act of 2007.  Eligible activities under this program include developing programs to conserve energy used in transportation (e.g., flex time by employees, satellite work centers, promotion of zoning requirements that promote energy efficient development, transportation infrastructure: bike lanes/pathways, pedestrian walkways); implementing building codes and inspection services to promote building energy efficiency; and developing, implementing, and installing on or in any government building onsite renewable energy technology that generates electricity from renewable resources.  Over $2.6 billion in formula grants are now available to U.S. states, territories, local governments and Indian tribes under this Program.  Specifically,

* nearly $1.9 billion is available to cities and counties,
* more than $770 million is available to states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia,
* nearly $54 million is available to Indian tribes.  
To see a list of entities eligible for formula grants and allocation amounts, click <http://www.mmsend1.com/ls.cfm?r=53279331&sid=6399930&m=716308&u=APTA&s=http://www.eecbg.energy.gov/grantalloc.html> here.

Subject: Oppose additional tax burdens on America's Oil and Gas Industry

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: I am writing to you to express my deepest concern regarding the future of our local petroleum industry. The Obama Administration has proposed sweeping changes to the tax burden on the oil and gas industry that if enacted will significantly harm our area's oil and gas production industry, and the jobs and economic benefits that it brings to our local economies of southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky. Taxes aimed at the local oil and gas production industry are the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, elimination of expensing of intangible drilling costs, elimination of the passive loss exception, and a change to the amortization schedule for geological and geophysical costs. Repeal of the Percentage Depletion Allowance alone will devastate the American oil and gas industry. If enacted, this proposal will not only result in an immediate and huge increase to our tax burden, but it will jeopardize the continued existence of economically marginal stripper wells that account for nearly all the production in the Illinois Basin. Percentage Depletion Allowance was established in 1926 and is available to companies who produce less than 1,000 barrels of oil per day. The proposed repeal of this provision is a direct attack on small independent producers and interest owners like us. The Obama administration has also proposed significantly raising taxes on America's oil refining companies. These "Carbon" taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel will increase energy costs significantly, by some estimates as much as $3000 per year per person. The higher energy taxes will also significantly increase the cost of operating the local farmer owned CountryMark oil refinery located in Mt. Vernon Indiana. This refinery buys most of the oil produced in our area. As one of the nation's smallest refineries, this refinery is much more vulnerable to higher taxes than those owned by the large oil companies. The higher tax structure threatens the 350 jobs at CountryMark, as well as hundreds more that depend upon the economic activity arising from the company's operations. In conclusion, I encourage you to oppose the Obama Administration's attack on American oil and gas industry. Eliminating longstanding tax code that encourages the responsible development of American energy, and adding carbon taxes to small refining companies such as CountryMark, will only increase our nation's reliance on foreign oil while destroying thousands of American jobs. In the Indiana area alone, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs are at stake and none of them work for "big oil". Sincerely, Ann Kurz 1404 Ventnor Pl Cary, NC 27519-6329

Percentage Depletion Allowance was established in 1926 and is available to companies who produce less than 1,000 barrels of oil per day. The proposed repeal of this provision is a direct attack on small independent producers and interest owners like us. The Obama administration has also proposed significantly raising taxes on America's oil refining companies. These "Carbon" taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel will increase energy costs significantly, by some estimates as much as $3000 per year per person. The higher energy taxes will also significantly increase the cost of operating the local farmer owned CountryMark oil refinery located in Mt. Vernon Indiana. This refinery buys most of the oil produced in our area. As one of the nation's smallest refineries, this refinery is much more vulnerable to higher taxes than those owned by the large oil companies. The higher tax structure threatens the 350 jobs at CountryMark, as well as hundreds more that depend upon the economic activity arising from the company's operations. In conclusion, we encourage you to oppose the Obama Administration's attack on American oil and gas industry. Eliminating longstanding tax code that encourages the responsible development of American energy, and adding carbon taxes to small refining companies such as CountryMark, will only increase our nation's reliance on foreign oil while destroying thousands of American jobs. In our area alone, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs are at stake and none of them work for "big oil". Sincerely, Sandra Maxwell 323 Staples Dr Rolesville, NC 27571-9464

Subject: Oppose additional tax burdens on America's Oil and Gas Industry

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: I am writing to you to express my deepest concern regarding the future of our local petroleum industry. The Obama Administration has proposed sweeping changes to the tax burden on the oil and gas industry that if enacted will significantly harm our area's oil and gas production industry, and the jobs and economic benefits that it brings to our local economies of southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky. Taxes aimed at the local oil and gas production industry are the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, elimination of expensing of intangible drilling costs, elimination of the passive loss exception, and a change to the amortization schedule for geological and geophysical costs. Repeal of the Percentage Depletion Allowance alone will devastate the American oil and gas industry. If enacted, this proposal will not only result in an immediate and huge increase to our tax burden, but it will jeopardize the continued existence of economically marginal stripper wells that account for nearly all the production in the Illinois Basin. Percentage Depletion Allowance was established in 1926 and is available to companies who produce less than 1,000 barrels of oil per day. The proposed repeal of this provision is a direct attack on small independent producers and interest owners like us.

Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm concerned about underage drinking. The time has come to get
serious about this issue and adopt policies that protect our
children. 

I support common-sense, research-based measures that will help
reduce underage drinking, including:

- Increasing alcohol prices through taxes, particularly on beer;
- Limiting alcohol advertising and marketing targeted at young
people;
- Implementing a national media campaign that counters alcohol
industry messages and uses social marketing to affect attitudes
and behavior;
- Adopting and enforcing laws to prevent alcohol-related deaths
and injuries among young people;
- Promoting alcohol free events for kids;
- Expanding counseling and support for kids, especially those
with addicted parents.

These and other measures are recommended by The Institute of
Medicine: 
http://www.jointogether.org/IOM

I strongly urge you to make these policies a priority at the
state and local level. Thank you.

Subject: Gas Tax Hike

Comment: Please do not allow the gas tax go up again! I know that the General Assembly is getting ready to vote to not cut the gas tax, but instead leave it where it is at 29.9 cents a gallon (still one of the highest in the South East) and leave this as a minimum and may raise it. With People losing their jobs, HOW CAN THE TAXES keep going up? Please I ask you as a NC native and citizen donâ€™t raise the tax. Most of my friends have been out of work due to the economy, we just canâ€™t face any more tax increase. Where is it going to come from? People are losing their jobs. Thanks

Dear Governor Perdue,
I am current resident of Hudson, North Carolina and have lived in the town
for 41 years.  I am an active member of the Caldwell Humane Society and Pet
Partnerâ€™s Network.  All my spare time is volunteering between both
nonprofit groups, l have a passion for the welfare of all Godâ€™s creatures.


Caldwell County euthanizes over 5000 animals per year; the animals face a
horrible death from the gas chamber.  They gasp for air, choke, shriek
horrible screams, bleed and try to escape by banging against the doors and
then dumped into the area landfill.  Is this humane?


The gas chamber located in Lenoir, North Carolina kills thousands of
unclaimed animals in a Carbon Monoxide Gas Chamber each year.  Which is
funded by my taxes, the gas chamber located in Lenoir is known to leak
hazardous carbon monoxide which is dangerous for shelter workers as well.


I am pleading for you to support and outlaw the heinous practice of gassing
animals to death.  Instead, replace with the humane injection of sodium
Phenobarbital to allow these animals to die comfortably and peacefully.


Please speak up the animals for they have no voice of their own.  Donâ€™t let
another animal suffer an agonizing death.





Regards,





Michelle Wood-Richards

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: I recently received a past due sales tax notice on a boat I bought in 2007. I paid the taxes on time and correctly. On the notice, the sales price was wrong and the notice was sent in "error", according to the DOR. This notice showed a 10% Failure to Pay Penalty, a 25% Failure to File Penalty and a 25% Negligence Penalty. How can this can happen while NC has not even suggested when my tax refund will be processed? I asked this question of the DOR rep and was told contact the governor so... Thank You, David Blevins

I am writing regarding an issue that is vitally important to all self storage operators and tenants in North Carolina.  As a constituent and Manager of a small self-storage facility, I am asking for your support in OPPOSING a sales tax on self storage rentals. Sales tax on self storage is a bad policy for many reasons. Applying a sales tax to self storage rents would add another tax burden on the most vulnerable members of the community.  The majority of our customers come from low and moderate income households, are families needing storage due to difficult circumstances (such as deployment, foreclosures, lost jobs, divorce, death, natural disaster, etc.), single-parent households, military families, retirees, and small business owners.  These are the people that rely on self storage facilities. Imposing a sales tax on self storage rent would tax the very citizens that the government should be striving to protect.



Legislators should also be aware that goods in self storage units generally were subject to sales tax when purchased, and may be family possessions handed down from generation-to-generation. Indirectly taxing those goods over and over again by taxing the monthly rent paid to store the items seems unfair, particularly when no such sales tax would apply to those keeping similar items in larger offices or those with storage space in their homes.



Similarly, self storage rent should not be treated differently for sales tax purposes than is rent from other real estate. Just as there is no justification to applying the sales tax to rent paid for an apartment or an office, there is no logic to applying the sales tax to rent paid to store belongings that will not fit into a tenant’s apartment, home or office.



While we are sympathetic to the current fiscal difficulties that almost everyone faces, we strongly urge you to consider the many adverse effects of imposing sales taxes on self storage unit leases, and to reject such an unfair approach. It seems clearly wrong to try to reduce a governmental deficit by requiring the inequitable sacrifice of low and moderate income self storage customers, those needing storage during difficult personal transition periods, uprooted military families, and small business operators by imposing sales tax on only this type of rental real estate.



Thank you for your time and consideration.



Sincerely,

Patricia Balousek, Manager

Reform legislation is needed to prevent a major bailout of the Beach Plan, the state-backed insurance provider for high risk coastal properties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.5 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.6 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could bankrupt the woefully under-funded Beach Plan, which may ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents in the form: - Higher taxes: A recent study shows that the Beach Plan bailout could result in a potential tax increase of up to $1,555 for every state taxpayer. - Higher insurance rates: The same study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for non-coastal residents. Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm. If approved, the Beach Plan reform legislation would help stabilize the stateï¿½s coastal insurer by allowing it to build its reserves, purchase the necessary financial products to ensure solvency and allow it to fully pay its claims after a storm. Over the long-term, the legislation will also begin reducing the size of the Beach Plan, to reduce the risk it has placed on the state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support legislation to prevent a major Beach Plan bailout.

Reform legislation is needed to prevent a major bailout of the Beach Plan, the state-backed insurance provider for high risk coastal properties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.5 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.6 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could bankrupt the woefully under-funded Beach Plan, which may ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents in the form: - Higher taxes: A recent study shows that the Beach Plan bailout could result in a potential tax increase of up to $1,555 for every state taxpayer. - Higher insurance rates: The same study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for non-coastal residents. Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm. If approved, the Beach Plan reform legislation would help stabilize the state?s coastal insurer by allowing it to build its reserves, purchase the necessary financial products to ensure solvency and allow it to fully pay its claims after a storm. Over the long-term, the legislation will also begin reducing the size of the Beach Plan, to reduce the risk it has placed on the state. In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. Please support legislation to prevent a major Beach Plan bailout. Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Sincerely, Tom Ross Tom Ross sent this message using the Capwizï¿½XC system on the PCI Web site.

Subject: Oppose additional tax burdens on America's Oil and Gas Industry

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: I am writing to you to express my deepest concern regarding the future of our local petroleum industry. The Obama Administration has proposed sweeping changes to the tax burden on the oil and gas industry that if enacted will significantly harm our area's oil and gas production industry, and the jobs and economic benefits that it brings to our local economies of southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky. Taxes aimed at the local oil and gas production industry are the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, elimination of expensing of intangible drilling costs, elimination of the passive loss exception, and a change to the amortization schedule for geological and geophysical costs. Repeal of the Percentage Depletion Allowance alone will devastate the American oil and gas industry. If enacted, this proposal will not only result in an immediate and huge increase to our tax burden, but it will jeopardize the continued existence of economically marginal stripper wells that account for nearly all the production in the Illinois Basin. Percentage Depletion Allowance was established in 1926 and is available to companies who produce less than 1,000 barrels of oil per day. The proposed repeal of this provision is a direct attack on small independent producers and interest owners like us. The Obama administration has also proposed significantly raising taxes on America's oil refining companies. These "Carbon" taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel will increase energy costs significantly, by some estimates as much as $3000 per year per person. The higher energy taxes will also significantly increase the cost of operating the local farmer owned CountryMark oil refinery located in Mt. Vernon Indiana. This refinery buys most of the oil produced in our area. As one of the nation's smallest refineries, this refinery is much more vulnerable to higher taxes than those owned by the large oil companies. The higher tax structure threatens the 350 jobs at CountryMark, as well as hundreds more that depend upon the economic activity arising from the company's operations. In conclusion, we encourage you to oppose the Obama Administration's attack on American oil and gas industry. Eliminating longstanding tax code that encourages the responsible development of American energy, and adding carbon taxes to small refining companies such as CountryMark, will only increase our nation's reliance on foreign oil while destroying thousands of American jobs. In our area alone, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs are at stake and none of them work for "big oil". Sincerely, Larry Creed 6522 Stonehill Ct Charlotte, NC 28213-0618

Subject: DMV Proposed Bills

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: The State of NC DMV is trying to pass Bill-S476 which will truly impact the car enthusiastâ€™s of this state. They are truly killing the private sector. Please review SEMA Bill-S820 and Bill-H861. These two bills address automobiles, 35 years and older, and they are intended to embrace the car enthusiast. DMV Bill-S475 legalizes the universal DMV inspection by Enforcement and Theft Officers on all cars that are 35 years or older. If that is the case, what training, if any, are they or will they receive to judge an antique vehicle? It also allows the State to tax us for the labor we put into restoring our own cars and/or on the labor sub-contractors spend on our vehicles. How in the name of God can you tax time spent on your hobby? We already have paid taxes for the work performed, and taxes on parts purchased, and NC annual Registered Vehicle Tax. Give us a break! We are trying to preserve a little bit of history, and it seems these bills, if passed, will be penalizing us for our efforts. It seems to me, that Senator Don East and Senator Majority Leader, Tony Rand, are not the least bit interested in preserving automobile history, but only in lining the pockets of the DMV. Sincerely yours, George J Trax Antique Car Enthusiast

In January, a legislative study committee of state lawmakers from both the coastal and inland area recognized the immediate need to fix the Beach Plan to protect the state. And the Commissioner of Insurance has repeatedly called the Beach Plan a ticking time bomb. I personally don't think that people like me who have no house on the coast should bear an extra burden of higher insurance rates so the richer folks can pay less for their insurance. Please support legislation to prevent a major Beach Plan bailout. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Subject: Beach Plan Bailout

Comment: Terry Horner 51 Forest Road Asheville, NC 28803-2943 May 18, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am writing today to ask that you please support legislation to prevent a major Beach Plan bailout. Reform legislation is needed to prevent a major bailout of the Beach Plan, the state-backed insurance provider for high risk coastal properties. The Beach Plan currently covers $73.5 billion in property on the coast but can only pay $1.6 billion in claims. Without reform this year, a major hurricane hitting the North Carolina coast could bankrupt the woefully under-funded Beach Plan, which may ultimately wind up costing all North Carolina residents in the form: - Higher taxes: A recent study shows that the Beach Plan bailout could result in a potential tax increase of up to $1,555 for every state taxpayer. - Higher insurance rates: The same study showed that insurance rates could increase up to 200% for non-coastal residents. Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm. If approved, the Beach Plan reform legislation would help stabilize the stateï¿½s coastal insurer by allowing it to build its reserves, purchase the necessary financial products to ensure solvency and allow it to fully pay its claims after a storm.

Additionally, there is a threat that coastal homeowners who are covered by the Beach Plan would see severe delays in the payments of the claims following a storm.
