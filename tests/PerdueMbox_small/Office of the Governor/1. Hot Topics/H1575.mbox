Dear Governor Perdue,

Please reject H1575, 'Accelerate Remediation', which weakens
standards for the cleanup of groundwater pollution.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters
shirk responsibility for spills. As North Carolina grows, we're
going to need all our groundwater resources. We can't afford to
write them off today as a subsidy to businesses that have been
careless. That's not fair to future generations, and it's not
fair to existing businesses that have taken appropriate care.
Please defeat H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.

I know people who get their water from drinking water wells,

carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm asking you to vote against H1575, a 'risk remediation' bill
that would lower the standards for cleanups of soil and
groundwater pollution.

I know people who get their water from drinking water wells,
from groundwater. In fact, many of my own personal relatives,
including my parents and grandparents, do. Regular testing
doesn't cover all the toxic chemicals that can contaminate
groundwater. We depend on North Carolina's strong current laws
that require full cleanups of contamination to keep our drinking
water clean. H1575 would remove that requirement, putting the
health of current and future well users in jeopardy. H1575, if
passed, will weaken our state law by allowing a polluter to
propose a weaker 'site specific standard' rather than cleaning
up their entire mess. But as North Carolina?s population grows,
clean soil and groundwater are increasingly precious resources
and we can?t afford to contaminate them.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals

H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please reject H1575, 'Accelerate Remediation', which weakens
standards for the cleanup of groundwater pollution.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters
shirk responsibility for spills. As North Carolina grows, we're
going to need all our groundwater resources. We can't afford to
write them off today as a subsidy to businesses that have been
careless. That's not fair to future generations, and it's not
fair to existing businesses that have taken appropriate care.
Please defeat H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Thank you for the opportunity to express my views. I would like
for you to oppose H1575. Any laws to protect groundwater and
other lakes, sterams, etc. should be toughened, not weakened.

Remediation of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal
with, corporations would spend less to avoid them, leading to
more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

Thank you!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm asking you to vote against H1575, a 'risk remediation' bill
that would lower the standards for cleanups of soil and
groundwater pollution.

I know people, who get their water from drinking-water wells,
from groundwater. I, myself, own rentals with wells. Regular
testing doesn't cover all the toxic chemicals that can
contaminate groundwater. We depend on North Carolina's strong
current laws that require full cleanups of contamination to keep
our drinking water clean. H1575 would remove that requirement,
putting the health of current and future well users in jeopardy.
Given our very health is at risk...can we really afford to
weaken this protection?

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Clean-up of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully in the first place.
H1575 would let companies determine a 'site- specific standard'
for their particular property, and potentially enable them to
cause spills and walk away without fully cleaning up their
mistakes, transferring the cost to future generations.
With spills costing much less to deal with, corporations would
spend less to avoid them, leading to more frequent spills and
accidents.
We, and future North Carolinians, need clean water. Please
oppose H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please reject H1575, 'Accelerate Remediation', which weakens
standards for the cleanup of groundwater pollution.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters
shirk responsibility for spills. As North Carolina grows, we're
going to need all our groundwater resources. We can't afford to
write them off today as a subsidy to businesses that have been
careless. That's not fair to future generations, and it's not
fair to existing businesses that have taken appropriate care.
Please defeat H1575.


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Remediation of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal
with, corporations would spend less to avoid them, leading to
more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm asking you to vote against H1575, a 'risk remediation' bill
that would lower the standards for cleanups of soil and
groundwater pollution.

I know people who get their water from drinking water wells,
from groundwater. Regular testing doesn't cover all the toxic
chemicals that can contaminate groundwater. We depend on North
Carolina's strong current laws that require full cleanups of
contamination to keep our drinking water clean. H1575 would
remove that requirement, putting the health of current and
future well users in jeopardy. We should not have to worry about
our water. I am trusting you to make the right decision. Thank
you.
