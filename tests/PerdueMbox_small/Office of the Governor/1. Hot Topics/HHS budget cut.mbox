Subject: Personal Care Services

Comment: Am interested in knowing where the Governor stands on the Personal Care Services industry. I know there seems to be one on every street corner, but all of those are not quality companies. Will those fly by night companies with all of the negative connotations give a black eye to the reputable companies cause the services to be cut to the point that those people who need the services will be hurt?

Subject: what about the children?

Comment: Shelly Roeder 37 S Lindon Cove Rd Candler, NC 28715-8346 June 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I am a resident of Buncombe County, NC, and I'm employed by Madison County Public Schools. I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and hold the position of School Social Worker in Madison County. I am gravely concerned about the proposed cuts for education. I've been in public education for 17 years and fear that any endorsement of the proposed education cuts will be detrimental to NC youth and families. Classroom size is critical to the overall environment of the school. Increasing class size will deter from on task behavior and not work to facilitate an environment where every student's academic needs are met. How do we expect our young people to function optimally when they are "lost" in a room of too many? As a School Social Worker, my goal is to work with children and families to help them navigate barriers to education. Serious environmental issues among our young people are real and can NOT be "checked" at the school building doors. The host of issues our youth and families face is endless - to include mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence, physical/sexual/verbal abuse, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behavior, poverty, medical illness, health insurance deficits, etc. In order to access and benefit from educational programming, children and families must have student support services. Without these services, students will likely not be as engaged in their school experience and not progress academically. I ask that you be a voice for these students and their families - a voice for the child whose parents are getting a divorce; a voice for the student who is struggling with depression; a voice for the youth who are cutters because they have limited healthy coping mechanisms; a voice for the person who does not have money to pay for lunch yet does not qualify for free/reduced lunch; a voice for the child who is sick yet can not afford to go to the doctor because they have no health insurance - A VOICE for every student who brings all these burdens with him/her to school each day. Without your support to stop educational cutbacks, North Carolina children and families will suffer immediately and for years to come. Sincerely, Shelly Roeder, MSW, LCSW

Subject: Proposed Changes in Medicaid Private Duty Nursing

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: As you have recently demonstrated your concern in the area of health care with the ban on smoking, I wanted to remind you of the recent changes proposoed by the DMA and the devestating consequences for all North Carolinians (not just Medicaid clients) if these changes become policy. What follows is a copy of my letter to the DMA. I trust that as a governor of the people, you will give it your full attention. Thank you. ï»¿ To the DMA: I am gravely concerned about the proposed changes in Medicaid PDN. I believe these changes devalue the lives of Medicaid clients. Not only are the proposals medically dangerous, they will ultimately prove to be more costly than the funding dollars they purport to save. In the area of Congregate Nursing, if both clients experience medical emergencies at the same time, the nurse will be forced to choose which client to place into a life-threatening situation. Medical complications, such as transmission of diseases, multiply if clients are sharing a nurse as proven by studies of nosocomial infections. With the 16 hours-a-day cap, not all adult clients reside with family members capable of providing skilled care or receiving medical training. The additional requirement of Back-Up Care would seem to place the burden of acquiring personnel on the client, increasing stress both emotionally and financially. The Overnight Travel/Vacation Care provision creates a potentially dangerous situation if travel is required for out-of-own medical treatment. The client would either have to travel without a nurse or by the expense of ambulance. The provision potentially creates a civil rights issue as travel to Raleigh to meet with representatives and present arguments to the House and Senate could be impeded. Also, the lack of respite for caregivers will increase risk of mental health crises, further endangering the client. The Technological Point Assessment Ranking System disallows the medical needs of individual clients. Ultimately this ranking would lead to the reduction of skilled monitoring by nurses. For Ventilator Dependent Trach Patients, the inability to provide additional care due to lack of financial or caregiver resources will lead to these clients either trying to find a nursing home that can accommodate them or an ICU. Most nursing homes in North Carolina do not accept ventilator clients due to the level of care needed. The expense of ICU hospitalization versus home care for this population can hardly justify the adoption of these proposals. The possibility of blatant violation of the Olmstead ruling is also evident here. In addition to the arguments against the proposed PDN changes presented above, I would like to remind the DMA of its commitment to quality medical services for low income individuals. To shift the burden of financial responsibility to those clients least able to bear it is inefficient at best and immoral at worst. Thank you for your time in consideration of these statements. Sincerely, Teresa Staley (336) 299-1247

Subject: please do not do such deep cuts

Comment: Barbara Potter 4723 Powder Horne Lane Conover, NC 28613-8580 June 3, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Individuals with disabilities need help! They need to have to services that will help them to be more independent and gain skills and abilities. I would humbly request that you consider the fact that to make the proposed cuts would mean vulnerable people would lose services that they need. Cuts in services would also mean that many who have been on waiting lists for years, would still not have the services that they need. More people will be hospitalized and homeless for sure. For many who already live a marginal life, they would now live even a more meager existence. In a time when there are so many line items to consider and fat has to be cut, I know that it is certainly not in this field. For example, I can tell you of children waiting for services that do not have them at all. I can tell you of children with profound Mental Retardation that have been on the waiting list for CAP MR-DD services for two years. I can tell you about kids who have had Development Therapy services one day and had them suspended for months until additional funding came through. how do you explain that to a child, let a lone to a family? There are people who need to have the new CAP waiver for Autism unfold. Tyr to find a bed for a person with autism who is about to be homeless and find that most of the homes have had no one move out in several years and that there are no beds. How about staff staying with a person who has mental health issues on the staff persons weekend off due to no hospital across the state willing to take them? How about carrying the pager after working 50 to 60 hours a week just to help people and then take the phone to bed with them and get up in the middle of the night to deal with a crisis? The system on its best day is like a bird flying with a broken wing. To make cuts would be devastating to the people that are served as well as those who serve them. One of the greatest challenges in serving people with MH or DD issues is that the there is such a major paper trail that has to be in place that there is a huge amount of time in the paper work and not helping to provide services. The charts have to be in good order with mammoth paper to prove that the person has been served well. in reality a chart, can be in perfect order and the consumer less than served. With the knowledge that difficult choices are inevitable in this economy, it is imperative that you find the appropriate balance in your decision making and do not completely destroy the strides that have been made in the delivery of human services over the past. I would gladly stand before those who make the decisions and plead for the people who need the help. I can be reached at 828-303-1250. I beg your consideration that goes past politics and what looks good to the very core of humanity. Please make cuts elsewhere and perhaps ask those who are in the trenches doing their best what change might be made. Together a tough task, can likely have a greater outcome through working together to do the most with less. Sincerely, Barbara Potter 828-303-1250

My name is Rhonda Miller and I am sending this email in reference to every disabled person in North Carolina that are about to get the Medicaid MH/DD/SA cut.  I have a daughter that was born with 2  birth defects and has only had these (CAP) services for about 4 years even though she is 38 years old.  I am disabled and unable to care for Christy and have several caregivers to help me out with Christy and I need their help desperately and if her Cap services get cut then it will be very hard on me to take care of her.  Another cut is her Goodwill and transportation services and she desperately needs these or she would have to sit at home and her little mind would be busy and she would get very depressed.  I am asking you and holding the House responsible to take care of all of the disabled people in North Carolina.  Obama can cut out all of his Pork Barrel spending so these people can get their service.  Enough is enough and there needs to be no more spending.  These people didn't ask to be born and they have been and need to be taken care of and myself and other people have agreed on this same problem.  These disabled people have it hard enough must less having to have their services cut.  This isn't fair to even think about cutting these people from their services.

If you need to call me here is my number 828-650-0247

Thank you so much for taking your time to check into this email.

Dear Governor Perdue,



For years, Adult Care Homes in North Carolina have been pushed to the brink by consistent underfunding of Medicaid and Special Assistance programs.

Now, budget proposals being circulated in the N.C. House will cut millions from these programs.

These cuts, if enacted will result in thousands of layoffs of workers PLUS directly impact the quality of care and supervision of many thousands of frail, elderly and mentally ill residents in North Carolina.

I urge you to oppose these cuts.

Sincerely,

S. Lynn Lackey

I want to urge all of you to look very closely at the proposed budget cuts proposed for adult care services.  These cuts will definitely hurt the elderly and the quality of care that they receive.  As someone that works in this industry we know that it is already a struggle to provide these services now and with the proposed budget cuts it will be much more difficult and in some cases impossible resulting in many excellent facilities having to close their doors. 

Not only will this impact elder care it will add to the already huge jobless rate in North Carolina.  This will hurt many many many people over a very wide area.   With the jobless rate already so high and the forced terminations or potential closings adding to this number the burden to the unemployment benefits would far outweigh the benefits of the budget cuts.    I feel if you are looking long term and at the BIG picture improving the budget for these facilities and services is the better option or at least maintaining -- but definitely not cutting these services.   

Our elderly deserve good quality care provided by qualified staff.  Please help us to continue to be able to provide that care.

Karen Payne, CPC

As a concerned citizen, as well as an employee of a Local Management Enity, I feel that I must speak out in regard to the proposed House budget cuts to mental health, developmental disability and substance abuse (mh/dd/sa) programs in North Carolina.
I have worked in the mh/dd/sa service field for eight years now, as a paraprofessional, case manger, advocate and service analyst. I have witnessed first hand the upheaval caused to individuals receiving services, by state mental health reform. Now, just as we were finding some stability, the proposed budget cuts will eliminate or drastically reduce services to individuals in our community and across North Carolina.
My objections to the proposed cuts are as follows:
* Individuals who are receiving mh/dd/sa services need stability to maintain their progress and remain in their community.
* The proposed cuts will reduce or eliminate the services these individuals need to remain in their communities and have productive lives.
* Reduction in jobs in health and human services and education will result in less services and increasing demands.
* Individuals and families will lose crucial services and local governments are not in the position to fill the void
* The proposed cuts will lead to an increase in jail populations and hospital emergency departments will be overwhelmed because individuals are coming in who need mh/dd/sa services and have no where else to go.
* The proposed cuts will lead to more hospitalizations due to lack of services in the individuals community.
* Due to the proposed cut of 465 undefined positions, which will impact the state run hospitals that most of the individuals in my community utilize, state hospitals will not have the staff to meet the increase in individuals needing hospitalization.
* Last year Crossroads was able to respond to more that 9,000 citizens in Iredell, Surry and Yadkin counties, almost 2,000 needing and receiving services with in two hours. If funding is cut there will be an increase in suicides because there wont be help available within two hours.
* Crossroads used the LME Fund Balance this current fiscal year to mitigate the state budget cuts and continue providing services to our citizens. If this funding is reduced we will not be able ensure that services will be there for our citizens. We have already been asked by our contract providers for more funds so they can expand their programs to meet the demand but we have not been able to do this. If funding is reduced we may not be able to fund the programs we already have let alone have funds to expand services.
* There has been much in the news in the last year about the misuse of community support services. Yes, there were some community support providers that misused the service but on the whole there are hundreds of providers who use the service appropriately and help individuals get back on their feet and become productive citizens in their community. If funding is cut for these services what will happen to these individuals? I fear they will be in jail, in an institution or dead.
* When I was still on the service delivery side of mh/dd/sa services I worked with an individual who had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Alcohol Abuse. This individual was an alcoholic for 20 years, could not maintain a job and was arrested multiple times. With the support of mental health and substance abuse services this individual has been sober for 9 years, completed his GED and is taking college courses. He has also discovered his artistic talents, creating designs for flowerpots and woodwork that he can sell through local business. Without support I fear this individual will decompensate and either end up in jail or institution.
In conclusion I would like to ask that you consider the upheaval already caused by mental health reform to individuals in services, their families and communities and vote against these proposed cuts. In these tough economic times we all must make sacrifices, but to sacrifice our most vulnerable citizens is morally wrong and irresponsible. It will cost more in the end (human lives) than it will save

Subject: Cuts to Medicaid and CAP-C

Comment: June 5, 2009 Michele Hendrix 2316 Faircloth Way High Point, NC 27265 Re: State Budget Cuts to Medicaid, Health and Human Services Dear Governor Perdue, My name is Michele Hendrix and I live in High Point, NC. I have a 9 year son who has a chronic debilitating disease that requires tube feeding and nursing care. He also has severe bone/joint problems that may require him to use a wheelchair soon. He was born perfectly fine but a virus attacked his system at 6 months of age. It has only been with the help of the CAP-C Program that our family has been able to survive. Having in home help from competent nursing agencies has kept him out of the hospital. With help from CAP-C my husband was able to work and to keep our family afloat. I canât do it without the help of the agency nursing that we get. Hospital care would have cost more and he probably would have fallen prey to the many infections that exist in that setting. By cutting Medicaid and reducing the payments to healthcare providers you are putting already medically fragile children at great risk. Lowering the payments to these providers will cause the agencies to hire less competent employees and some physicians may not accept the patients since the payment is so low. I further disagree with plan to make CAP-C participants pay on a sliding scale based on parental income. The whole point of the waiver was to base the help on the childâs resources not the parents. Even with the help of CAP-C parents have to pay a lot of money out-of-pocket. I myself canât work because of the round the clock care my son requires. His life is at grave risk without the help of the CAP-C program. Please donât make the most fragile children bare the cost of this crisis! Sincerely, Michele A. Hendrix

> Gov. Perdue Welcomes Apple to North Carolina

Apple has selected North Carolina as the location for a new data center.  The company is expected to invest more than $1 billion in the project over nine years.

> North Carolina continues to be a prime location for growing and expanding global technology companies, said Gov. Perdue.  We welcome Apple to North Carolina and look forward to working with the company as it begins providing a significant economic boost to local communities and the state.

> The announcement comes after Perdue signed Senate Bill 575, which modifies the method by which capital-intensive businesses calculate corporate income tax liability in North Carolina.

> The facility is expected to employ at least 50 full-time employees.  The legislation requires that the average wage exceed the wage standard of the county in which its located.  A data center such as this will typically contract locally for services such as server maintenance and repair, building and HVAC maintenance, landscaping and security  expenditures that could range from $5 million to $6 million annually in the region and create up to 250 jobs.  The North Carolina Department of Commerce projects that a data center investment of $1 billion would create more than 3,000 jobs in the regional economy, including hundreds of jobs related to construction and others created as a result of economic growth.

> As part of the legislation, a capital-intensive industry must meet investment and wage standards and provide its employees with health insurance.  It also must locate in one of the states more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 areas.

> During these tough economic times, its important to make the investments that create jobs in areas that need them the most, said Gov. Perdue.

> State Grant Helps Ethan Allen Expand in Maiden, Create 302 Jobs

Ethan Allen Operations Inc., a manufacturer of high-quality upholstered furniture for residential and commercial customers, will expand in Maiden.  The company will create 302 jobs and invest $2.79 million during the next three years.

> North Carolina continues to support high-value national operations creating new jobs for our people despite current economic challenges, Perdue said.  Our state remains attractive to established companies, which know the value of our top business climate, skilled workforce and tremendous quality of life.

> Ethan Allen Operations is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (NYSE:ETH), with headquarters in Connecticut. The company is a leading manufacturer and retailer of quality home furnishings and operates eight manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including two sawmills and one manufacturing facility in Mexico. The companys two Maiden plants manufacture custom-made, handcrafted upholstered furniture.

Gov. Perdue Welcomes Apple to North Carolina

Apple has selected North Carolina as the location for a new data center.  The company is expected to invest more than $1 billion in the project over nine years.

North Carolina continues to be a prime location for growing and expanding global technology companies, said Gov. Perdue.  We welcome Apple to North Carolina and look forward to working with the company as it begins providing a significant economic boost to local communities and the state.

The announcement comes after Perdue signed Senate Bill 575, which modifies the method by which capital-intensive businesses calculate corporate income tax liability in North Carolina.

The facility is expected to employ at least 50 full-time employees.  The legislation requires that the average wage exceed the wage standard of the county in which its located.  A data center such as this will typically contract locally for services such as server maintenance and repair, building and HVAC maintenance, landscaping and security  expenditures that could range from $5 million to $6 million annually in the region and create up to 250 jobs.  The North Carolina Department of Commerce projects that a data center investment of $1 billion would create more than 3,000 jobs in the regional economy, including hundreds of jobs related to construction and others created as a result of economic growth.

As part of the legislation, a capital-intensive industry must meet investment and wage standards and provide its employees with health insurance.  It also must locate in one of the states more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 areas.

During these tough economic times, its important to make the investments that create jobs in areas that need them the most, said Gov. Perdue.

State Grant Helps Ethan Allen Expand in Maiden, Create 302 Jobs

Ethan Allen Operations Inc., a manufacturer of high-quality upholstered furniture for residential and commercial customers, will expand in Maiden.  The company will create 302 jobs and invest $2.79 million during the next three years.

North Carolina continues to support high-value national operations creating new jobs for our people despite current economic challenges, Perdue said.  Our state remains attractive to established companies, which know the value of our top business climate, skilled workforce and tremendous quality of life.

Ethan Allen Operations is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (NYSE:ETH), with headquarters in Connecticut. The company is a leading manufacturer and retailer of quality home furnishings and operates eight manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including two sawmills and one manufacturing facility in Mexico. The companys two Maiden plants manufacture custom-made, handcrafted upholstered furniture.

The company is leaving a leased facility in California and consolidating those operations to its Maiden facilities, which currently employ 540 workers.  The move will replace 143 jobs lost in previous layoffs and will add 159 new jobs for a total of 302 jobs.

The announcement was made possible in part by a $109,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.  Although individual wages will vary by job type, the jobs will pay an annual average wage of $39,946, higher than the Catawba County average wage of $34,216.

North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate.  Through Governor Perdues JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Dear Governor Perdue,
I suppose it is great that Apple will bring 50 full-time jobs to the area as with the PROPOSED CURRENT BUDGET THAT IS IN THE HOUSE, the state of North Carolina potentially will be losing up to 90,000 jobs.  With all of the cuts to health and human service and education, it will devastate the states work force and plunge us into a depression.  New employment opportunities should be celebrated, however, the current issues that are going on in the House of Representatives with proposed cuts of services/funding to our most vulnerable citizens and many of us that will be losing our jobs due to this do not feel like celebrating 50 jobs through Apple Computer.  Will this facility and the revenue it produces offset any of the proposed billions of dollars of cuts?  That would be worth celebrating. 
We need a tax increase not a service/funding cut to the citizens of NC that are living with daily Mental health, Substance Abuse and Developmental Disabilities.

Respectfully,
Elizabeth Boltz-a NC citizen that voted for you.

Yes, Madam Governor, all this is well and good for our economy. But, have you lost your mind in the process of balancing the budget??? How can you take away necessities from those of us who ate disabled and trying to live on just a ss disability check? With only $818/mo., I cannot afford to live alone! Also, my fiancee is also disabled, and our two checks combined ($1067. for him) barely let us pay the mortgage, food, utilities, medicines, and upkeep of a car, including gas...and if we get married, we will lose some of the medical help we so desperately need! Why would you not pay for a prosthesis? Have you ever lost a limb? I have, my foot, and without a prosthesis and help from UNC Chapel Hill to get one, I would not be able to walk, get groceries, even get out of the house...and I am not alone in this! And when was dental care separated from a body's general health??? My fiancee is walking around with rotted teeth in his mouth, most broken off but the roots still there, and he gets infection after infection, causing sinus problems and pneumonia and added pain to his crushed back problems. We cannot scrape enough money together for having them extracted, and although his doctor is trying to get him into the surgery unit of Chapel Hill Dental School, he has heard nothing about it yet, two weeks after his doctor sent the referral! I can only reason that you all want those of us who have gotten hurt badly or old to die off so y'all can have even more than you have today. There is no other way to think of all these horrid cuts for those who cannot do anything to get up off the floor and try to live!! Shame on all of you!!

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] North Carolina Lures New Companies































Gov. Perdue Welcomes Apple to North Carolina
Apple has selected North Carolina as the location for a new data center.  The company is expected to invest more than $1 billion in the project over nine years.


âNorth Carolina continues to be a prime location for growing and expanding global technology companies,â
said Gov. Perdue.  âWe welcome Apple to North Carolina and look forward to working with the company as it begins providing a significant economic boost to local communities and the state.â


The announcement comes after Perdue signed Senate Bill 575, which modifies the method by which capital-intensive businesses calculate corporate income tax liability in North Carolina.


The facility is expected to employ at least 50 full-time employees.  The legislation requires that the average wage exceed the wage standard of the county in which itâs located.  A data center such as this will typically contract locally for
services such as server maintenance and repair, building and HVAC maintenance, landscaping and security â expenditures that could range from $5 million to $6 million annually in the region and create up to 250 jobs.  The North Carolina Department of Commerce
projects that a data center investment of $1 billion would create more than 3,000 jobs in the regional economy, including hundreds of jobs related to construction and others created as a result of economic growth.


As part of the legislation, a capital-intensive industry must meet investment and wage standards and provide its employees with health insurance.  It also must locate in one of the stateâs more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 areas.


âDuring these tough economic times, itâs important to make the investments that create jobs in areas that need them the most,â said Gov. Perdue.



State Grant Helps Ethan Allen Expand in Maiden, Create 302 Jobs
Ethan Allen Operations Inc., a manufacturer of high-quality upholstered furniture for residential and commercial customers, will expand in Maiden.  The company will create 302 jobs and invest $2.79 million during the next three years.


âNorth Carolina continues to support high-value national operations creating new jobs for our people despite current economic challenges,â Perdue said.  âOur state remains attractive to established companies, which know the value of our top
business climate, skilled workforce and tremendous quality of life.â


Ethan Allen Operations is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (NYSE:ETH), with headquarters in Connecticut. The company is a
leading manufacturer and retailer of quality home furnishings and operates eight manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including two sawmills and one manufacturing facility in Mexico. The companyâs two Maiden plants manufacture custom-made, handcrafted upholstered
furniture.


The company is leaving a leased facility in California and consolidating those operations to its Maiden facilities, which currently employ 540 workers.  The move will replace 143 jobs lost in previous layoffs and will add 159 new jobs for
a total of 302 jobs.


The announcement was made possible in part by a $109,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.  Although individual wages will vary by job type, the jobs will pay an annual average wage of $39,946, higher than the Catawba County average
wage of $34,216.


North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate.  Through Governor Perdueâs JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively
to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Gov. Perdue Launches Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program
Gov. Perdue today launched the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program at Wrightsboro Elementary School in Wilmington to promote the retention and growth of student reading skills during the summer break. Studies show that students who donât read
during the summer vacation are more likely to lag behind their peersâ reading level when they return to school in the fall.


âThe summer is a time for fun, family and a break from school â but learning is something we should do 365 days a year, seven days a week,â said Gov. Perdue. âThrough the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program, we can encourage our kids have a
good book in their hands even when theyâre away from the classroom. And we can make sure students continue to learn â and learn to love reading.â


Perdue read to a third grade class and talked to them about the importance and joy or reading. She demonstrated the new Find-a-Book Web site,
<http://www.lexile.com/findabook>www.lexile.com/findabook, to parents, students and school staff. The Find-a-Book web site contains a searchable database that matches a bookâs text difficulty to a studentâs reading ability through a Lexile reading
measure. In North Carolina, students in grades 3-8, as well as high school students taking the English I state assessment, will receive a Lexile measure in their end-of-year test results. Lexile is the most widely adopted reading measure in use today.


Perdue urged school faculty to promote the summer reading program to parents, while encouraging community members to become involved in the summer reading program as volunteers and mentors. The governor has sent letters and informational fliers
to principals and librarians. Parents will receive letters and information on the summer reading initiative with their childâs end-of-year report card.


Public libraries across the state are also participating in the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program. Library staff can assist parents and students with the Find-a-Book Web site and Lexile reading measures.


Today also marks the 100 year anniversary of Wrightsboro Elementary.



Defense Spending Increased in North Carolina During the 2008 Fiscal Year
Gov. Bev Perdue and the North Carolina Military Business Center (NCMBC) announced this week that Department of Defense spending in North Carolina grew by 22 percent and exceeded $3.6 billion in federal fiscal year 2008 â an increase of $657
million from 2007.


âThese numbers are yet another indicator that the Tar Heel state is becoming a very significant player in the global military and defense industry
cluster,â said Gov. Perdue.  âThe time to capitalize on this trend is now, to leverage expanding markets, capture federal revenues and grow jobs right here in North Carolina â the most military friendly state in America.â


Gov. Perdue was instrumental, with the General Assembly, in establishing the NCMBC in the Community College System and the Defense and Security Technology Accelerator (DSTA) in Fayetteville.  She also spearheaded the development of the North
Carolina Military Foundation, a private organization focused on recruiting defense contractors and growing the stateâs defense and homeland security economy.


According to a 2008 Department of Commerce study, the military has a $23.4 billion total annual impact on the state economy.  Defense procurement in North Carolina, based on place of performance, increased from $2.9 billion in federal fiscal
year 2007 to $3.6 billion in 2008.  During the same time frame, spending by all federal agencies in North Carolina increased approximately $743 million, or 16 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.2 billion.


For more information on Department of Defense spending and the North Carolina Military Business Center, please visit
<http://www.ncmbc.us>www.ncmbc.us.



Economic Recovery Workshops
Governor Perdue hosted two Economic Recovery Workshops this week.  The workshops in
Raleigh and Wilmington were the fourth and fifth in a series of six workshops to provide information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested
citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. The sixth and final workshop in this series will be held in Charlotte on June 18.

Law Enforcement Cites 15,132 Unbuckled People During "Click it or Ticket" Campaign
More than 15,000 drivers and passengers were cited for not wearing their seat belts or having their child properly buckled during the âClick It or Ticketâ campaign, which began May 18 and ended May 31.


"I thank law enforcement officers across the state who participated in this life-saving campaign," said Gov. Perdue. âI urge North Carolinians who still choose to remain unbuckled to think twice and remember that a seat belt or proper child
safety seat could save your life or the life of a loved one.â


The final statewide total for the campaign includes 13,654 seat belt citations and 1,478 child passenger safety citations.  State and local law enforcement officers issued the citations at more than 8,500 checkpoints and with stepped-up patrols.


The N.C. Governorâs Highway Safety Program administers âClick It or Ticket.â The program began as a national pilot project in 1993 to increase seat belt usage and child passenger safety through stepped-up enforcement of the stateâs seat belt
and child safety seat laws.


The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that North Carolinaâs 2008 seat belt usage rate was 89.8 percent, its highest rate ever. A NHTSA study published last year showed that when worn correctly, seat belts
reduce the risk of a front seat passenger being killed in a crash by 45 percent.

Mrs. Perdue please publicly speak out against a 'cuts only' way to balance the budget for NC. If these changes that are currently in place take effect it will be detrimental to the needed families in NC not to mention the childcare providers, teachers, etc...please speak out for us. I am a director at a childcare center in Mount Airy, NC, Surry County. I know first hand the service that we provide does make a difference to young children and the families that we come into contact with each and everyday. Without the funds to help these families find affordable childcare we wouldn't be able to make a difference. So please help us and speak out for us all. My name is Kristie Lowe and I live in Surry County. Thank you for  your time.

Sincerely,
Kristie Lowe

Govenor Purdue,



My name is Robin Gibson, and I live in Cherokee County, North Carolina.  The proposed cuts to services in NC are causing great concern for me.  I have both an elderly mother and 2 grandchildren, one in daycare and one going to public school.  Please dont proceed with this cuts only way to balance the budget.  I think there are probably many projects that could be cut that are not priorities and they should be cut but our children are our future and I want my mother to be taken care of.  Please speak publicly  against a cuts only way to balance the budget. I think there are cuts that could be made but I think the revenues need to be adjusted as well.  Please think long and hard about the budget choices that are being made and as many of us do privately cut the things that dont matter and find ways to increase revenues also.



Thank you for your consideration,



Robin

This sounds great. However, lets work on our cuts for DD and Autism benefits. As a mother of a dear child with a dual diagnosis of DD and Autism ,I have to make a choice of which disease to receive help for. If my son had a heart disease and cancer would I have to choose? Now you are saying these benefits are going to be cut. As he gets older and stronger without CAPS I may have to make a terrible choice that no Mother should be forced to make. I want my son to be with our family but without assistance I may not have that choice. Please reconsider what cuts are being made and how detrimental they will be to families. I am a law abiding, tax payer and my family deserves better.

Please don't cut state funding for my autistic child.  Raise taxes if you have to, but don't destroy the lives of so many of us who depend on these services.  We have been on the waiting list for CAP for two years and my family is barely hanging on.  Our home is mortgaged to the hilt and our credit is maxed out because the services my son desperately needs are so ridiculously expensive. 

We are in a family crisis because of autism and we need your help.  

Thank you,

Hello and let me start this off by thanking you for all that you are doing for our region, state and country during this terribly difficult time!

I am the mother of an incredible four-year old who has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.  Most people don't know about my son's disability because he was fortunate enough to receive Early Intervention at the early age of 24 months.  He was diagnosed by TEACCH and has been receiving their services for a year and he gets weekly OT, ST and social skills training.  He attended a typical preschool this past year with only an itinerant teacher provided by Mecklenburg County and due to all the services he has received thus far, we suspect that he will attend kindergarten in 2010 without any services.  We are also confident that he will be a great asset to our country, since he is brilliant and loves to learn.  He is already a great asset to our family!  

In reading the proposed budget line by line, I was alarmed in several places, though I found Line 122 especially distressing!  It might appear that you are saving money by cutting services, but let me assure you that PREVENTION and EARLY INTERVENTION are key!  It is proven that ASD kids who do not receive proper support, often struggle throughout their entire school years, have behavioral and anger management problems and repeatedly clash with law enforcement.  If you are not aware of the Autism odds these days, now 1 in 94 boys is on the Autism Spectrum and 67 children are diagnosed each day.  Do we really want to foster a nation without Early Intervention, OT, ST and PT?

I implore you to VOTE NO against the proposed budget!  This proposed budget reduces necessary services and puts high-needs kids at risk!  I do respect your position though and hope that in your attempt to BALANCE the budget, you will consider raising revenue taxes and making only very specific cuts, that preserve such necessary services for our next generation and special needs kids!  We're a true middle class family, but we are willing to sacrifice more out of our paycheck because these services are crucial! 

This well-meaning and very involved constituent and mom thanks you from the bottom of her heart!

Regards,
Chelsea Mellon

A new study shows that giving big tax breaks to corporations in order to lure them into an area does *not* create the economic boon that some folks have claimed it does.  Yet we contemplate giving another such tax break to a large corporation while at the same time virtually eliminating many vital services for the disabled.

It doesn't make sense. 

The services for the disabled that are provided by thousands of workers around the state contribute to our positive employment rate and our tax base.  Eliminate those services and you have compounded our economic problems, in the long run.

Not to mention our immediate and long-term social problems, as disabled children fail to receive the treatments they need during the formative years of their lives and disabled adults wind up adrift in a world where they are ill-equipped to survive...much less thrive. 

If you pass this current HHS budget, you will have harmed some of our most vulnerable citizens. 

We do not take good care of our vulnerable populations only when it is easy and convenient.  We take good care of them *all* the time because it's the right thing to do.  Even when it's not easy and convenient. 

Do the right thing.

We are against the budget cuts affecting first of all the education system and our school/college system.  Look at cutting the pay of the Legislature, etc. and your own salary first.

My name is Cathey Harrison, and I have been working with Home Health since 1989.  I understand that budget cuts must be made in order to balance the budget during these difficult times.  However, I dont understand the reasoning for cutting funds for Home Care.  This will hurt our senior citizens, those who are disabled and trying to remain in their homes, and persons who are dying and choose to die in their homes rather than in a hospital. 

Cutting funding for Home Health and Hospice will not only make life (and dying) more difficult for these patients and their families, they will end up costing the state much more than any savings from budget cuts.  Not only does it not make sense financially  (Average cost of Personal care services at home is $750.  Cost of rest home or nursing home can go from $1700 to $4000 per month, according to the Assoc for Home Care & Hospice.)

For those patients who need some extra help in order to remain in their homes, who are not medically appropriate for nursing home placement, I am afraid for those patients.  Without Personal care services (PCS) to provide care in the home while the family caregiver is at work (and paying taxes), who will stay with this person? Will they be left alone, at high risk for falling, or taking the wrong medication, or unable to prepare a meal for themselves?

These cuts will also affect the home care industry  Between 10,000 and 20,000 nurses aides could lose their jobs.  Adding these persons who want to work to the growing list of those on unemployment will only add to the problem. 

Please, try to stop these cuts to home care.  Im afraid that the legislators do not realize how much harm this will cause.

Thank you,

Cathey D. Harrison, RN

Please vote NO to the HHS budget cuts.  There will be jobs lost and children and elderly losing valuable services and professionals providing those services.  They will be forced out of NC to find work.  I would rather see taxes increased than these jobs and services lost.  Please VOTE NO!!!!!  Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.

I know that you are all confronted with a very harsh year with trying to produce a balanced budget.  However, one should not do that upon the backs of our most frail, ill, and disadvantaged citizens.  It continues to amaze me that our representatives are not seeing that these proposed cuts will actually cost the state (and taxpayers) more!  Thousands will be forced into the more expensive facility setting, thousands of health care workers will lose their jobs, the state will lose $110 million in federal matching funds intended to care for the seriously ill and disabled.  If you cant see the humanistic wrongdoings then think of it  this way ---------------------------------------------

 IF IT DOESNT SAVE DOLLARS THEN IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE. 

What you are proposing doesnt make sense and will cost the state more!  Think very hard about what you are about to do and the devastating effects your decision will have on the elderly, frail, and disabled and in return you will not save a dime. 

If you vote NO CUTS TO HOMECARE SERVICES you will however be saving a life! There is no greater good than that!

Our great State is facing a severe financial crisis.  However, I ask that you not put in place punitive measures, through budget cuts, which will negatively impact some of the most helpless individuals in our respective communities.  Unfortunately, many of these citizens live in deplorable circumstances, often in abject poverty.  One of their only opportunities for a dignified existence is through the Homecare Services offered through the PCS program.  Secondly, in addition to the humane aspect, the delivery of health care services through this program is quite cost effective.  Since the State is required to provide medical care, you will see the delivery system shift to much higher cost alternatives such as the emergency room and/or assisted-skilled facilities.  Further, many of the PCS services offered help with preventative care, hopefully reducing the need for more expensive acute care, which reduces current health care expenditures.

Lastly, thousands of workers will lose their jobs, and probably face great difficulty in gaining meaningful employment.  Many of these workers have upgraded their skills through Community Colleges so they can enter the health care field, after being displaced from textile, manufacturing, or farming employment, which has been eliminated.

Please consider the human component, the efficient cost delivery verses other options, and the financial eliminating this employment will have on thousands of lives.  Aggregating these facts should help you to arrive at the right decision.

Thanks for your consideration.

Good morning.

I am requesting that funding not be cut for personal care services.  We do not provide that service at Medi Home Health Agency, but many of our patients are able to remain in their home because of the personal care provided.  We provide skilled care under Medicare.
The difference in cost for a few hours a day and the cost of a bed at a facility is very different.  I am concerned that # 1, there are not enough beds available in the state to manage these patients; # 2, there is not enough staff at any facility;  and # 3, where will that money come from to pay the facility?
Please note that the study about inappropriate patients receiving personal care services was incorrect.
Feel free to contact me with questions and again, please do not cut funding.

Dear Representative,

I am a Registered Nurse working in your district. I am writing out of concern for the cuts that are being proposed for home care services. I have spent the last seven years working in home care and I can tell you these services are a vital resource for these patients. Without home care, many of these patients would end up in facility placement. The elderly and disabled are counting on you to protect their right to cost effective and accessible health care. For many of these patients home care is their only saving grace for living a better quality of life. Please consider the real difference you can make in their lives by allowing them to continue to receive home health assistance.

I appreciate your time.



Sincerely,

Emily Cook, RN

Dear Legislator,

I am writing due to grave concerns over the possibility of losing SLP, OT and PT services for children receiving Medicaid services. 

The proposed HHS budget will destroy professional lives (over 20,000 SLP, OT, PT and support staff!) while destroying our system of support services for North Carolinas most vulnerable citizens  the impoverished and the disabled children and elderly.  In our business alone you would be putting at least 20 people out of work and our business that weve worked for 14 years would fail.  The lost revenue in our business taxes and personal taxes, not to mention the increased cost of paying unemployment benefits for all these people would be catastrophic to our economy.  If were out of work we will move our families out of state decreasing the tax base even more as our spouses find work elsewhere.

·         These proposed cuts will eliminate thousands of professional and support jobs and drive our state economy from a recession to a depression. (over $30 MILLION in state payroll taxes eliminated by this cut for SLP, OT, PT + multiplier effect of lost sales tax, gasoline tax and increased unemployment payments  these $$$$$$ are STAGGERING!)  We will lose more than we save!

·          I urge you to use a balanced approach of increased revenue and more moderate spending cuts to solve the budget crisis.

Please vote AGAINST removing the critical services from our children and destroying the lives of so many.



Sincerely,

Tracy Vail, President

I urge you to restore the cuts to home care and hospice for our North Carolina citizens. Home care is by far the most cost-efficient and reliable health care delivery vehicle for our rural communities. Our older citizens do not thrive at all when removed from their familiar surroundings and families. Home care works for rehabilitation and hospice provides extremely cost effective comfort and support at the end of life. North Carolinians deserve this care and North Carolina has devoted professionals to deliver the care.

Please do not make cuts to home and hospice care!  As a Foundation supporting hospice patients I see and hear first hand how financially strapped patients and their families are by the time they have traversed our health care system and come to hospice.  Our Foundation helps them with most basic needs of the terminally ill including food, clothing, gas money, electric bills and funeral expenses.  I cannot imagine how they would cope without a hospice agency to support the caregiver. Please continue to allow patients to choose hospice to help keep them at home as a low cost alternative to spending their last days in a hospital.  As a nurse Ive never heard a family member say their loved one just wanted to go to the hospital to die.  They want to go home, to surround themselves with memories, with their loved ones, with their pets.  They want to say goodbye in their own time, with their own words, in a peaceful surrounding, not in the midst of overhead paging, IV alarms beeping, lunch trays being served, nurses scurrying in and out tending to 9 other patients.  With cuts to home and hospice care this is the picture our loved ones in their last hour will experience.  Lets allow them the dignity to remain in their home, assisted by professional health care workers, with a passion for care and the heart to sit with dying patients who invite them in at the most sacred time of their lives.

Dear Governor,



I have worked in the Healthcare Industry since 1985. I have worked in homecare for over 13 years. I have seen many people who are in need of homecare. Homecare gives people the quality of life that humans deserve. Homecare assures that these sick people will receive a bath, continent care, assistance to walk from room to room in their home, the ability to dress daily into clean clothing, a good healthy meal, and human compassion. Without homecare these sick people will receive little or no bathing, inability to go to the bathroom without falling, the inability to change into clean clothes, no healthy meals, and lonliness. They will end up in an assisted living facility due to no one to care for them at home, no dignity, and no quality of life. Assisted living facilities are needed. They are needed for those sick people who need round the clock care. It will be more cost to the state if we have to pay for assisted living services over in-home care services such as Personal Care Services. The economy will suffer due to these people going to assisted living facilities and the lay offs of the people servicing in the homes. I feel that if all citizens have to be effected by cutting out health care and jobs then the citizens that work in the government should make sacrifices as well. Unemployment will increase. The poor and elderly should not be a major resource for cutbacks. ALL citizens should make financial sacrifices or none. I voted for you because I feel that you are a wise woman and will make great decisions. Please understand your people in your state and how your decisions effect them. Thank you for your time.



God Bless,

DEAR GOV. PERDUE,

I VOTE AGAINST THE BIG CHAIRS REMOVING THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OUT OF POSITIONS WERE THEY ARE NEEDED.  IT IS NOT FAIR TO OUR STATE AND IT IS NOT FAIR TO TAX PAYERS AND AND IT IS JUST UNFAIR TO THE PEOPLE LIKE OUR CHILDREN, OR ADULTS WHO NEED THIS TYPE OF HELP.

SO PLEASE CONSIDER WHEN MAKING YOUR FINAL CHOICE "IS IT FAIR OR NOT".  WE AS TAX PAYING INDIVIDUALS PAY SO MUCH AND GET SO LITTLE IN RETURN, WHAT WILL WE HAVE TO GIVE UP NEXT.  YOU CAN ONLY ASK YOURSELF THAT QUESTION WHEN YOU SEE ALL YOU HAVE WORKED FOR AND TRIED TO ACHEIVE COME DOWN IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE OF WHAT THE BIG WHEELS WANT.  THE LITTLE WHEELS HAVE FEELINGS AND NEEDS ALSO.

THANK YOUR FOR BEING OUR GOVERNOR AND PLEASE HELP US TO KEEP THE HELP WE NEED.

GOD BLESS YOU

Dear Gov. Perdue:



I am disappointed in the proposed budget cuts that are coming out of Raleigh. As a mental health provider, I have for years seen my patients struggle to overcome the effects of mental health reform. I am aghast at proposed cuts to MH/DD/SA that will effectively put mental health care in this state back even further! And, the proposed further cuts to providers is untenable and will lead to many clinicians refusing to see these patients.  



This insane thinking must stop! Raise taxes!!!!! And get rid of wasteful spending and high compensation for chronies (e.g. Mary Easley) and demand that those who defrauded our state via fraudulent community support billings repay with penalties! 



Raising taxes is an option to maintain services to the poor and needy. But, lets be fair in where the taxes are levied. Sales tax increases seems reasonable, as does increases in gas, tobacco, and alcohol, taxes. Do not disproportionately tax the upper class by basing tax increases on income levels.



I hope that you consider ALL options before voting for this budget. As a state employee I have paid my share by recent pay cuts and mandatory furloughs. Now it is time for you to do your part!

Dear Governor Perdue,



This is in response to the proposed cuts in funding to the Home Health and Hospice budget.  This really does not make sense to any of us in home care.

The cuts will force our most vulnerable population into institutions for the care they need.  By keeping them in their homes the government will save thousands

of dollars per person monthly.  If Home Health care was utilized to its fullest the government could save millions.    



What is to be gained by spending thousands more on institutional care and having our elderly depressed and lonely? 



Very truly yours,



Nancy Slater RN

Your attention is urgently required on this matter.  We must stem the bleeding from these programs to satisfy the wealthy of our State.  
We can no longer tolerate a government that ignores the poor, sick, children, elderly, mentally ill and homeless.  And we will not.

Hello,
  My name is Jennifer Carswell. I work in home care for P.C.S and Cap
clients. We serve approxamately 75 patients in the Roxboro area and employ
approxamately 45 Certified aides for these patients. The proposed cuts that
are before the House and Senate will greatly impact the Seniors and the
employees that serve them. Without home care alot of these people are going
to have to resort to moving to a facility, which will result in more money
for the state to pay out for care that they otherwise could recieve for less
in their homes. In addition this cut will put  employees out of work which
will also result in more money spent in unemployment benefits. I do not see
this cut being effective nor reasonable in cutting down cost of health care,
if anything it is going to lead to more money being spent in other areas and
our seniors who really need the care are going pay the cost by being
displaced or left without anyone to help them.Please help our Seniors and
the people who care for them.
                Thank You

Dear Governor Perdue,

My name is Stacie Wilson. I am the owner of Stacie's Personal Care Services, a licensed home care in Marshall, North Carolina. We employ 140 people and serve 130 client's. The cuts being made in the Senate and the House will hurt the seniors, the disabled, the dying and the individual caregivers who selflessly serve this population. 

Home care is $1,000-$3,000 less expensive to provide, on a monthly basis ,than long term care. Home care provides increased quality of life and improves patient outcomes. Home care decreases hospitalizations.We supported you in this past election and  we ask you to support us now. 

The PCS program survey data that was recently brought to the forefront are inaccurate. I can prove this on our individual survey results. The Association for Home and Hospice Care has data to refute the survey data from agencies state wide. As an RN who has practiced in the home health, hospice and long term care arena's in Madison and Buncombe County for the past fourteen years, I beg you not to abandon the client's we serve and the incredible staff who serve them.

Sincerely,
Stacie Wilson,

I am writing in regard to the budget cut for Personal Care that is going before the House in coming days. I wanted to explain that if this service is cut out alot of the seniors that recieve the service will have nowhere to turn to other than facilities, which will cost the state more than the current charges. This program is very important in the communities to help people who require assistance to remain in their homes, but do not require 24 hour care. I also noticed that Cap-C is not in the budget for cuts and I personally have seen that they get more hours and time than any other area in home care why is it that those services are not being looked at and cut out in the budget ? Those particular cases (CAP-C) get respite time in addition to longer cap hours and other hours as needed, they add up to many more than any adult I have worked with.
