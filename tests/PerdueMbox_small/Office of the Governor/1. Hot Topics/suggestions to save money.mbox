Subject: Bill to Tax Soda

Comment: Gov. Purdue. Concerning the bill that is being debated to levy a tax on sugared sodas, I'd like to add some technical information and offer some advice. Most "sugared" soda sold in NC isn't sugared at all. It is sweetened by high fructose corn syrup. This corn syrup causes more unwanted weight gain due to the fact that it is not well metabolized in the system. In fact, it needs to be processed in the liver. These facts can cause two problems in such a law. Firstly, the large soda producers which use corn syrup by the railcar load might be able to slip through a loophole in the law if it specifically taxes "sugared" sodas. This would leave the tax burdon on the smaller soda companies. My suggestion would be to levy the tax on sodas WITH the corn syrup and not tax the sodas with the natural sugar. While admittedly, the sodas with the natural sugars aren't exactly wholesome, at least they aren't as unhealthy as those with the corn syrup. Specifically taxing sodas with high fructose corn syrup makes sense both because it closes the sugar loophole and it taxes the more unhealthy sodas. Cheers Charles King, NC

Subject: saving state money

Comment: I recently reregistered my car, there was a hold that prevented it going through so they sent me a letter. I went right out and dealt with the issue but - here is the money saving part. DOI did not put my payment in a hold file so I could notify them of my complianse and go on. They have put it in a "return mail" pile (different than the alert! letter) which has NOT gone out yet. When it gets to me, I will do the entire process again. Multiply one stamp x a million (random number) people and x 1hr salary x 1 million people and this starts to look like a very stupid, bureaucratic idea of efficiency. And expensive when we can't afford it. We have afterschool programs that need that money. Can you change this any quicker than next year? I shall deliberately make the same mistake next year to confirm that the process has been changed.

Subject: Saving NC Money

Comment: Please consider what the state of Utah has done. It could possibly save the state of NC some money and give some of us much more needed time with our families. Utah's 4-day workweek brings some dividends By PAUL FOY, Associated Press Writer Paul Foy, Associated Press Writer Thu Oct 22, 8:04 am ET SALT LAKE CITY – Closing Utah state offices on Fridays has delivered an unexpected bonus: a big saving on overtime pay. New calculations show Utah saved $4.1 million in the first year of a government experiment with a four-day workweek. State employees were eager to leave after the longer workday, and weren't inclined to work an extra hour or two. "They're getting what they need to get done in 10 hours and going home," said Angie Welling, spokeswoman for Gov. Gary Herbert. "The state envisioned some energy savings, but that overtime number was not anticipated," she said Wednesday. Utah was the first state in the country to shut down most of its services on Fridays. Other states took notice. Hawaii tried a limited four-day week last fall, when a similar program was under way in Washington state. Lawmakers in at least two other states — West Virginia and Virginia — have also looked into adopting a four-day workweek. Former Gov. Jon Huntsman made the switch for Utah in August 2008, largely to cut energy costs. Utah, however, achieved only a sixth of the $3 million it expected to trim on energy costs. The state couldn't shut down as many state buildings as it planned on Fridays, officials said, and it didn't save much by closing the smaller buildings. Also, the state assumed gasoline for state fleet car use and building utility costs would soar, and it would save as much. Both expenditures actually fell over the past year, however. Utah has some of the lowest utility rates in the country. The energy saving came out to $502,000 for the year. The state also saved $200,000 on janitorial services. With reduced overtime expenses, the total saving was $4.8 million. The figures were released Wednesday by Herbert's strategic planner, Mike Hansen. The new governor — Huntsman left to become the U.S. ambassador to China — is undecided on whether to stick with the program, Welling said. "He's still reviewing the results. He feels like we have good data on the amount of cost savings, employee satisfaction and the energy reduction. What he things is missing is input from the public," she said. To that end, Herbert will commission a poll of public sentiment — citizens lost a day of government service with the switch. State workers are largely happy. Another survey found 85 percent of the workers like working four longer days better than five shorter ones. Working mothers like Carolyn Dennis — she has two young sons — found a way to adjust. "It's actually a lot easier than the five-hour day, because I have all day Friday to clean and run errands and still have the whole weekend to spend with my kids," said Dennis, customer service manager for the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing. "I actually found it's freed up my time. We never did anything in the evening anyway, but having that extra day has made it easier to be a working mom." Dennis leaves the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan at 5:45 a.m. with her youngest, a 2-year-old, in tow. she drops him at a day care center near work in downtown Salt Lake City. Her husband, a business owner, drops the couple's 7-year-old son, a first-grader, at school. Dennis works from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., skipping lunch hour and leaving a half-hour earlier than normal. That allows her to cut down a long day for her youngest. "I started out getting him dressed while he was still asleep, but now he's getting up early for breakfast. Ryan is still on a malleable infant schedule. He's happy and smiling when I drop him off, so it makes my day go better," she said. All things considered, Dennis would never switch back. "I do love the 4/10 and told my boss if they take it away, I'll probably cry," she said. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091022/ap_on_bi_ge/ut_four_day_workweek
