Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #440] NC SEPA and Carolinas Cement

Governor Perdue,
This is a follow up to my conversation with your assistant Lesley concerning the need for NC SEPA to apply to Carolinas Cement.
My name is Dr. Robert Parr.  I am a specialist in Emergency Medicine and I have have practiced medicine in Wilmington since 1983.
Prior to my medical career I obtained an advanced degree in Biological Oceanography from Oregon State University where I studied the effects of industrial development on the marine environment.
During that period and afterward, I was directly involved with numerous environmental/industrial siting studies both nationally and overseas.
I am presently a member of the US Army Corps of Engineers Carolinas Cement Scoping/Stake Holder Committee. 
I have met numerous times with representatives of Carolinas Cement and I have personally visited Medley, Florida home of Titan America's Pennsuco cement plant on my own.
I have spoken on numerous occasions with representatives from the National Parks Conservation Association, who along with the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council have
been opposing TItan America's mining operations in Medley, Florida since 2002.




Briefly:
NC SEPA is a required for Carolinas Cement to protect human health and our local marine environment.  The legal requirements for enacting SEPA have been met  by this project.
In Florida Titan America's permit to mine in Medley, Florida has been overturned three times since 2002 for failing to protect the aquifer for Miami Dade County and for failing to properly mitigate wetlands destruction.
It is my opinion that the pending NC DAQ permit has not been crafted with necessary input from NC health professionals and NC marine resource specialists, whose responsibility it is to protect human health and our marine resources.  NC SEPA would require their input prior to any permitting decisions.  If NC DAQ has received written input from these NC professionals to date ask them to provide this information to your office and the general public at this time.
I have forwarded your office an open letter from Carolinas Cement chiding the NC Marine Fisheries Commission for the commission's request that NC SEPA apply to this matter.   The representatives of the Marine Fisheries Commission have one obligation and that is to protect the viability and health of our marine resources.  It is their respected opinion that NC SEPA is necessary in proceeding with any permitting at this stage.  Clearly a foreign owned, out of state company should not be lecturing our NC representatives on these matters. 
At the first public meeting in New Hanover County on April 21, 2008, representatives of Carolinas Cement and it's backers failed  to answer even basic questions regarding the environmental impacts of the proposed Carolinas Cement plant in Castle Hayne.   Nancy Pritchard, our County Commissioner who voted against the incentive package, did so because in her own words she was not provided with the necessary information on which to vote.  Numerous private citizens also asked for more detailed information at that meeting - information that was not forthcoming in a timely manner.
Only recently was it verified that on April 21, 2008, the same day of this meeting, the limestone mines at Titan America's Pensucco cement plant in Medley, Florida were closed by federal order for threatening the drinking water supply of Miami Dade County and failure to properly mitigate destruction to affected wetlands.

At the same time that Titan America was obtaining incentive grants from New Hanover County and working to obtain NC State grants from North Carolina, the Titan America mines in Florida were closed by court order.   This was vital and timely information that was withheld from public view seemingly to advance the needs of Carolinas Cement  at the expense of the people and resources of North Carolina.
Clearly this is not a company that should be allowed to evade NC SEPA by retrospective maneuvering, which may enhance the companies bottom line at the expense of the citizens of North Carolina. 

If you or your representatives would like to speak with me personally about these matters do not hesitate to contact me.  I can provide detailed reference sources for all above facts.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter. 



Dr. Robert A. Parr

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue; I have been a physican in Wilmington for 13 years and am a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC-Chapel Hill. I have signed (along with 233 other local physicians) a petition expressing deep concern over the health impact of the proposed Titan Cement plant, particularly on our children. We are outraged that they are going through the permit process without submitting to SEPA Review of their environmental impact. Please use the power of your office to force them to submit to the more rigorous SEPA review. I would be happy to discuss these issues with you in detail, by phone or in person in Rlaeigh. Thank you for your attention. Frederick Opper M.D.,F.A.C.P., F.A.C.G., A.G.A.F.

Dear Governor Perdue,



As I’m sure you are aware, Titan America’s political allies and lobbyist were once again able to delay efforts at legislation that would require Titan to undergo a State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) review. This law applied to Titan's project when it was first announced to our community, and would have delayed any state permits until the federal EIS was complete. State officials allowed Titan to slip out of SEPA last fall, even though many experts say it still applies.



YOU are our last line of defense against this pollution plant. Please ensure that Titan follows ALL NC laws, especially SEPA, which was specifically designed to evaluate the impacts of major polluting projects like Titan before any permits are issued.



Those of us who live in this area realize the miniscule benefit of their presence will be far outweighed by the garbage they spew into the air, land and water, but politics being what they are, Titan still stands a good chance of having their way with us.



Please, don’t allow them to blatantly bypass our long standing rules too.





Thank you sincerely,



Jeff and Joyce Keller

Wilmington, NC

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am writing you as a concerned resident of the Cape Fear region. I speak for myself, my wife (an oncology nurse) and our 4 year old son when I ask that you require Titan America to undergo a full SEPA review prior to any permits being issued. I attempted to call your office regarding this issue, but was informed your voicemail was full. I suspect it was a result of many like-minded residents voicing their opposition to putting heavy polluting industries like Titan in the midst of this area, which requires its natural resources to support the fishing, tourism, and filmmaking industries. To protect our environment, our other industries, and the citizens of this region (including children) from the potential impacts of this project, we insist that Titan America should follow all NC laws, especially SEPA, which was specifically designed to evaluate the impacts of major polluting projects like Titan before any permits are issued. Sincerely, Keith Shea Leland, NC

Governor Bev Perdue,

As is expressed in the attached letter, I am writing to express concerns about the proposed Titan America Cement Plant and quarry operation to be built in Northern New Hanover County / Southern Pender County.

This proposed plant will harm us physically, environmentally and economically, all for the benefit of a select few, far too few to warrant this project on any level of approval.

I find it appalling that this company was able to sidestep the requirements for a full environmental impact study.

Please help. We are in danger. I ask for any assistance on your part to help STOP this project.

Sincerely,

Geoffrey Grimsman

Dear Governor Purdue:

I am writing to express my outrage at the fact that Titan Cement Company has been able once again to delay efforts at legislation that would require a State Environmental permit.  I strongly support the need for full environmental analysis and disclosure, and am extremely disappointed that a well financed company with bountiful lobbyists is able to continue to sidestep processes that exist to protect the citizens of the area.

As a small business owner who is bound by permitting requirements, I find it extremely troublesome that special arrangements are made for Titan Cement.  The Cape Fear River is an icon of southeastern North Carolina, and the wildlife and ecosystems it supports impact the overall health of the area.

I strongly urge you to support legislative efforts to require Titan Cement to undergo appropriate pemitting and review processes.

Regards,

Jennifer Coombs

Subject: Titan SEPA

Comment: Dear Governor: I do not live on the coast so have no personal convictions about Titan and its impacts, but I did take the trouble to look at the comments from the US Fish & Wildlife folks, and from your own agencies, NC Marine Resources, NC Wildlife Resources, and NC DWQ. Each of these agencies was very negative on the Titan project and each assumed from the get-go that naturally a project of this magnitude and impacts would get a full Environmental Impact Statement. Now, somehow, no EIS is required! This is just not right! These laws were put in place for the benefit of the citizens of NC, and if decisions are to be made putting the benefits of jobs and money ahead of our environment it should be done in the open with full knowledge of what we are actually doing. Sneaking around the process designated by our Legislature is completely unworthy of you and your administration. Sincerely, Bill Thomas

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue. NC citizens (the majority that doesn't fill their pockets at the public's expense), are sick and tired of companies being allowed -- in fact, enabled -- to skirt the supposed protections for citizens health and natural resources. DENR should not bow to corporate/special-interest pressure and relieve Titan of their responsibility to fulfill SEPA requirements. As Governor, it is your duty to uphold the law and the best interest of the PUBLIC, and to do this, you must require Titan to follow the regulations (SEPA) that are supposedly in place to protect the public.

I have empathy for your circumstances dealing with ALL the critical issues you face on behalf of your constituents. However, there is an issue of dire importance in need of your particular attention because it concerns the health and well being of CHILDREN OF WILMINGTON.  I’m sure you know that TITAN CEMENT is planning to locate in Wilmington. The detrimental effects of Titan’s pollutants are well documented by at least 200 Physicians in Wilmington. CHILDREN are especially vulnerable; especially children with asthma. As a Nurse, working in emergency rooms, I have all too often taken care of the frightened gasping children who are unable to breathe. As children, THEY cannot appeal the Titan proposal themselves. So many parents in Wilmington are fighting for their children’s RIGHT TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR. Senator Julia Bosman has tried to help but it seems that TITAN IS TOO BIG AND TOO WELL CONNECTED for us to fight. I’m begging you to help us help these children. I know you are aware that pollutants don’t observe borders! While President Obama is trying to improve air quality, it’s hard to understand why he and our congressional representatives are so oblivious to this issue. Again, it appears that TITAN MONEY AND LOBBYISTS are more powerful than any of us. Also, with the rising costs and concerns of healthcare, it is even more critical to look at ways of PREVENTATIVE MEDECINE. I urge you to give this issue PRIORITY.





THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. Patricia Conlon

Dear Committee Chair and Members:
Â 
We are writing you in support of Sen. Boseman's bill, SB 699 the Cement Plant Moratorium and Study Bill.Â 
Â 
We are twenty year residents of Wilmington, NC, who moved here to raise our children.Â Â Â  One of us is a clinical psychologist, and the other is an attorney who teaches environmental law and who was aide to Sen. Frank Block.Â  Without answers to the serious health and environmental issues raised by a plant, we (and most of the residents we talk to) wonder why one plant is favored over the retirement and tourism community, which brings in billions of dollars to the area?Â  We moved to this area largely because of the quality of life, and we know many others who have retired to the area and moved here to raise children.

We understand the need for building materials, but how can anyone weigh the value of this single plant that is 10 times the size of the previous plant against our most significant industries without serious inquiry?Â Â  Only 160 new jobs are claimed, and economists dispute that number.

The support of a study is broad based:Â  (1) Over 200 physicians question the health effects (Consider Dr. Opper's opinion article below; medical questions are not limited to mercury); (2) Businessmen like Chuck Agnoff, founder of Interroll, question recruitment of other industries if polluting industries are sited here<http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090424/ARTICLES/904244005> http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090424/ARTICLES/904244005, and (3) all three of the major newspapers favor a thorough study (Charlotte Observer, Wilmington Star News (<http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090326/ARTICLES/903274000>http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20090326/ARTICLES/903274000) and N & O <http://www.stoptitan.org/press/5-stoptitanpress/29-observer>http://www.stoptitan.org/press/5-stoptitanpress/29-observer).

While claiming to be benign, the proponents have refused a complete and thorough environmental review.Â  What are they worried about if there are not significant effects?Â  The air emissions alone (including mercury and other toxins), coupled with the proximity to important wetlands and the Northeast Cape Fear River, warrant scientific study and facts, not public relations efforts.

Please vote for this bill in committee and on the floor.Â 

Respectfully,

Sally J. MacKain, Ph.D., Clinical PsychologistÂ Â  Â Â  Â Â  Â Â  Â Â  Robert H. Cutting, Attorney

Those in favor of this factory attempt to paint their opponents as anti-job, anti-development environmental extremists. Physicians, however, are generally rather conservative small-business owners who have a profound interest in the economic development of our region.

Cement production is a particularly noxious activity. The medical literature clearly documents increased risks of serious respiratory problems in proximity to such plants.

Titan has applied for a permit allowing it to emit, among other substances, mercury. According to Martha Keating of Duke University, sulfur dioxide, sulfate particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, hydrochloric acid and other inevitable by-products of cement production are of grave concern.

She warns us that some of these by-products have been known to cause cancer, others impair reproduction and normal development of children, and can worsen conditions like asthma, leading to emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

Titan advocates argue that the area is already zoned for industry and is the former site of a cement factory. However, not only has our knowledge and awareness of toxic industries grown in the 27 years since the previous cement factory closed, but the area itself is no longer appropriate for such a factory. The region has expanded, and now more than 8,000 children will live or attend school within five miles of the factory.

Titan's claim that it will meet all state and federal safety requirements is of small comfort. Scientists know that, often, decades lag between awareness of an environmental threat and the political will necessary to protect us from it.

Secondhand smoke has long been known to cause significant disease Only recently and hesitantly have states moved to protect its citizens. Along similar lines, the use of seatbelts has long been known to save lives. Yet again, only comparatively recently have seatbelt laws been widely enacted.

How many lives would have been saved if protective measures had been enacted sooner? How will the parents of New Hanover and Pender Counties react in 10 to 20 years when they realize that they allowed their children and grandchildren to grow up in the toxic shadow cast by Titan Cement?

Titan recently paid for a study by Intertox which purports to show that the mercury released by their factory will have a negligible effect on our counties' citizens. This study omits data on the 140 other toxins that cement factories admit releasing into the environment. It comes as no surprise that the Intertox study, financed by Titan, arrives at this shockingly benign conclusion. (EDITOR'S NOTE: the study was done before the EPA announced new mercury standards.)

The medical literature is replete with articles and opinion pieces demonstrating the huge bias in favor of a product when the research is funded by the product's manufacturer.

This study cannot be taken seriously.

Although Titan promises to limit its output of toxins to permitted values, experts such as Harvard trained Stephen Lester, director of the Center for Health Environment and Justice, and Philip Landrigan professor of pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, agree that there is no safe level of mercury exposure for children.

Put another way, all levels of mercury exposure can be harmful to fetuses and small children.

Titan claims that it is managing the risk by adhering to regulations. More than 300 local health care workers - doctors as well as a group of other health professionals who signed a separate petition - disagree.

Whom will you trust with the health of your family?

Governor I am specifically asking you  to enact the State Environmental Policy Act that was not properly applied by the Department of the Environment or Natural Resources and/or put all state permitting in abeyance until the federal Environmental review is completed for Titan America. 



We really do not need this type of industry here in North Carolina to destroy our wetlands, our aquifer (check out sinkholes) and our tourism.  



Please, we respectfully request that ALL state permits be placed on hold til all Federal/State environmental reviews are completed and all regulations are placed into effect. 



Please advise.

About 10 years ago, I witnessed an event where just a minute amount of cement from a bridge construction poisoned and killed fish for miles downstream in the town of Fairview, NC. I would hate to see what could happen to the NC coastline & the delicate ecosystem that is our wetlands. Thanks for your consideration.

I am one of the 200 physicians in WIlmington who strongly opposes Titan America.
The heavy metal, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrochloric acid, benzene, and at least 50 other toxic emissions from this plant will be a serious long term health risk to my patients and family.
Titan America must not be allowed to receive it's Air Quality permit until all scientific and environmental health issues have been studied and the full Environmental Impact Statement is concluded.
Titan America is presently rushing the process for the benefit of Titan America to the severe detriment of the people of North Carolina.
I would deeply appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Dear Governor Perdue,



I am pleased to have you for our governor and believe you love North Carolina and the people who live here. I trust that you will do what’s best for us in your decisions.



I am asking that you help me and other citizens in New Hanover County and the State of NC by opposing the Titan Cement Plant which, by all appearances, is being forced upon us. A secret deal by three N.H. County Commissioners with an environment polluting industry should not be binding for our more caring and conscientious public officials such as you. Even if approved by your predecessor, I have confidence that you see the need to protect the citizens and will withhold (and use your influence to persuade others to withhold) any approval of Titan. I believe the deal can be stopped and must be stopped!  At the very least, I ask that you support every delay on any deal long enough for any and all environmental safeguards to be checked out to the fullest extent. The citizens in our county are very disturbed and mistrustful of those who would put a business deal ahead of health and environmental considerations.



I know we need jobs here, but we can get other companies to come to the state (such as your new initiatives) that are not dirty, heavy industries like Titan. We don’t need Titan at all. Their damage will far exceed any benefit. If Titan comes in, the future will show what a mistake it was and I would not want the responsibility of that travesty to fall at the feet of one of our good Democratic leaders.



The front page headlines in today’s Star News (Wilmington newspaper) is “IQ Scores Linked to Prenatal Pollution.” I ask that you read that article and other evidence about the proven health hazards from cement plants including the mercury emissions, particular pollution and the list goes on.  



It is clear to all in New Hanover, except for a few business types, that Carolina Cement in our county will cause irreparable harm. We depend upon you and our other elected officials to protect us instead of going along with ill advised business deals. We need you now to protect us from harm.



Let’s keep our Carolina skies blue, our air safe to breathe and our tiny coastal county inviting to tourists and those who might choose to move here. We need the tourism much more than 150 dirty.



With my deepest appreciation for your help, Dorothy Holt, (910) 791-1602

Email: mikey7569@yahoo.com

Subject: Titan America - Wilmington, NC

Comment: My name is Michael Bolick and I'm asking that Governor Perdue require Titan America to undergo a State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) review. This important environmental law requires that all the impacts to my community from Titan's massive coal-burning cement plant and open-pit mine will be known before any state permits are granted for this project. Without SEPA there is no state review of alternatives for this project and no chance to assess and publish the impacts in a public document prior to any final decisions or actions. I am concerned about the impacts of Titan's project, especially (pick any: the destruction of 1,000 acres of wetlands; mining for limestone directly above our main source of drinking water -- the Castle Hayne aquifer; the thousands of tons of particulate matter emitted each year; increases in mercury emissions into our community as well as our river that is already listed as mercury impaired; increases in emissions that cause harmful ozone and smog; the effects of emissions that are known to cause cancer, like arsenic, benzene and chromium; how Titan's emissions will affect the more than 8,500 school children who will be forced to attend schools within 5 miles of their site; because more than 200 Wilmington Doctors are opposed to Titan's project because of the health impacts to our community -- especially our children). SEPA originally applied to Titan's project when it was first announced over a year ago. Titan has since gone to great lengths to modify their original proposal and pursue dubious loopholes that will avoid triggering this law that was enacted by the NC legislature in 1971 specifically to protect public health and our environment. Titan needs to follow this important environmental law. Please support my community. Sincerely, Michael Bolick

Dear Governer Perdue,
I'm writing to ask you and your administration to support efforts in the Legislature to slow down the fast track rush to impose a new coal burning cement plant and adjacent open pit limestone quarry on New Hanover County.  At the very least I ask you to not oppose such efforts.
The Carolinas Cement Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan America, LLC, itself a subsidiary of the Titan Cement Company of Greece, has lately been flooding Raleigh with a mix of half truths and whole dollars in their efforts to have this project put on the fast track with minimal environmental oversight or regulation.  The scale of the proposed project, the very nature of the industry, and the location of the planned plants and quarries should all demand stricter regulatory oversight, not expedited approval.  At the very least the project needs to be considered as a whole at each stage of the permitting process.  Air permits should not be issued for construction of the plant without considering the associated mining operations and no permits should be issued before the full Environmental Impact Statement is released.
That there are no cement plants operating in North Carolina further raises the question as to our capacity to competently evaluate and regulate this industry at all.  I'm very worried that applying standards developed for small scale gravel operations or manufacturing facilities to such a large operation may be inadequate.  Sen. Boseman's proposal for a temporary moratorium on new Cement Plant construction until such issues can be addressed (S699) seems eminently reasonable.
I have heard it proposed that the State of North Carolina invited Titan Cement to build this plant and that imposing oversight would be taken as rude and unfriendly to business.  This is simply untrue.  The facts of the matter are that Titan America (and its predecessors and sudsidiaries) first purchased the property in question some 25 years ago, promising, at the time, to build a state of the art $75 million cement kiln.  That didn't happen.  They later announced plans once again build a new plant for the site (this time throwing around numbers in the $200 million range) but, once again, nothing happened.  The sad fact is that Castle Hayne, NC is not a particularly good place to locate a cement plant.  The layers of limestone needed to feed a cement kiln are all located well below the local water table.  The workforce is there, the transportation links are there, and the land is there, but the topography and geologoy of the Atlantic Coastal Plain with its swamps, wetlands, rivers and lack of elevation all make responsible mining operations prohibitively expensive.  (Irresponsible mining operations can still be cost effective, but that's the whole worry here.)
After 25 years of start and stop plans from Titan, will a one year moratorium really be that much of a hardship?  After a quarter century of planning and replanning, why is it now imperative to build a new plant on a crash basis?  At one point Titan shelved its construction plans simply because it was more profitable to rent out the exisiting facilities on that property as a movie set.  If you wonder what the inside of a cement plant looks like I direct your attention to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies where the old plant served as the headquarters of "The Foot", the enemies of the heroes on the half shell.  I'm sure any further similarity between Titan Cement and an evil ninja clan behind a massive urban crime wave are purely coincidental.
Titan's PR machine has been hyping jobs as the #1 advantage of this new plant.  Again, the truth is less clear.  Cement is a very cyclical industry.  When times are good, cement is in demand and plants operate at capacity. When times are not good cement is not in demand and plants shut down for months at a time.  Long term, TItan promises jobs only when we don't need them.  Titan gets more support from its short term claims: the number of jobs it will bring to the area for plant construction.  Here there is some very short term truth: there will be construction jobs and construction jobs drive the economy of Southeastern North Carolina.  But consider also that Titan is building this plant in the northern part of the county.  New Hanover County is a fairly small (geographically) county and largely built up.  Our beach towns are built up.  Our urban areas are built up.  The region experiencing the most growth the past few years (and projected to continue that way for the forseeable future) is northern part of the county.  But putting a giant open pit mine and cement kiln will effectively end residential and commercial development in that part of the county.  Holly Shelter Road will cease to be the new focus of housing development and become a designated heavy industrial blight area, much like US421 to the NW of Wilmington is now.  We do NOT need another stretch of 421.  The building industry in this area is  in good position to rebound and get back to building houses - but not if we poison their fields like this.
I was particularly distressed some months ago to see the Commerce Department lined up to oppose Boseman's S699 and later to oppose Sen. Justice's motion to bring such plants under SEPA.  This disappointed me on two levels.  First, it absolutely flew in the face of the talk of "green jobs" and "green industry" we've been hearing from your administration and especially from your Commerce Department and its NC Economic Development Committee.  Talking about green jobs while at the same time greasing the skids for a particularly dirty industry in a particularly sensitive region was the kind of hypocrisy nobody wants to see from a new administration. 
Secondly, I view this as a largely local issue.  The local delegation to Raleigh has been united in their wishes to see things slowed down and thought out.  Titan does not have broad local support.  What local support they have is small and uncommitted.  It's now widely acknowledged that the County Commissioners erred when they extended an incentive package to Titan, relying on the kind of strict regulation and oversight that Titan now seems to be avoiding.  Titan is a decidedly unpopular player in this county and we wonder why the powers that be in Raleigh seem determined to force it down our throats?  From a purely political standpoint, I believe supporting this project is a mistake.
I close with the example of the Elgin Marbles.  In early 19th century Athens the lime and cement industry did not necessarily quarry for raw limestone to fuel their kilns.  They used whatever limestone or marble was to be found at hand.  There was quite a bit of limestone and marble lying about on the Acropolis: the old, abandoned greek temples.  Fallen pieces and other pieces easily removed (sculptures, friezes, pediments, columns, etc.) were carted off and burned down to lime and cement.  Between1801 and 1813 Lord Elgin, then British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, purchased, removed and shipped overseas much of the most precious statuary and friezes from the Acropolis.  These masterpieces of antiquity were later acquired by the British Museum where they were preserved and displayed for hundreds of years until, fairly recently, the Greek government began agitating for their return.  Where they should be displayed today is an issue for artists and international lawyers, but it is widely accepted that had Lord Elgin not removed the marble pieces they likely would have gone into an Athenian limeburners kiln and ended up as stucco for some 19th century mixed use development. 
The Northeast Cape Fear River and Island Creek (the beautiful and rich area where Titan wants to build and strip mine) and the aquifer beneath (which Titan wants to lower by a hundred feet or more to access the limestone) are our Elgin Marbles, our natural treasures, our birthright.  We have no imperialist British ambassador with paternal instincts to ship the river off for safekeeping until we come to our senses.  We don't even have a foursome of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ready to crawl out of the sewers to save us from the evil Foot.  We don't need them.  We do have a basic framework of environmental protection in place.  We can expand on what we have and enforce the finished product and protect ourselves, but we can't do that if Raleigh lacks the political will to stand up to the limeburners and others who would ignore what protections are already in place.
Please, Governor.  Let the system work.  There ought be no rush to strip mine Island Creek or drain our fresh water aquifer.  If the plan is a good one, it will still be a good one a year from now.  This proposed plant will be here for 100 years.  Let's take the time to get it right.
Sincerely,
William Vinal

This e-mail is more about the Titan plant in Wilmington and less about education.  The lady only refers to education because the plant is near her children’s school.



Thanks,

Subject: Protect the health & safety of school children in New Hanover County

Comment: I am completely sickened by the fact the North Carolina is refusing to step up and make Titan go through the SEPA process. My children have been districted to attend a brand new middle school that will be 1.5 miles from the Titan smoke stack. Titan will emit 340 tons annually of particulate matter - the equivalent of 24.8 billion cigarettes directly over and elementary and middle school, along with known carcinogens and neurotoxins. As a person who is living with Multiple Sclerosis, which may have an environmental component, I am accutely aware of the hazards of letting my child attend school there. Would you live under a smokestack? I wouldn't, and I can not have my child attend a school under one. North Carolina is failing the school children of New Hanover County. This is a serious matter and the residents here are not being heard only Titan's lobbiest are being heard. Please do something! I do not want to get the diagnoses in a few years that my child has cancer or some other illness. I would never have moved to such a beautiful coastal region if I ever had an idea that North Carolina is okay with destroying it (along with the health of growing children). Don't fail us, Catherine Thomas, mother of two children, 8 & 12

Comment: Scott M.

The legislation contains a provision that allows states to opt out of the federal licensing program, and the choice for our state to stay in or opt out will come shortly after implementation of the legislation. As a constituent, voter, and proud poker player, I ask that you support keeping our state in this important program. U.S. House Bill H.R. 2267 and U.S. Senate Bill S. 1597 provide for sensible licensing, regulation, and taxation of Internet poker. They mandate rigorous, verifiable safeguards against underage participation while providing consumer protections for the millions, including many in our state, who play online poker every day. These bills also include dedicated funding to establish and implement programs for prevention and treatment of those with excessive gaming habits. Both bills benefit our state economically. According to an economic study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April, tax revenues from these bills will provide billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury and to the states in the program. Additionally, the Senate bill provides for revenue-sharing with participating states, bringing even more much-needed funds into our state's coffers. Both bills allow American companies to participate in the world's Internet poker market, bringing needed jobs to our state as well. Solutions like H.R. 2267 and S. 1597 provide the most rational approach to controlling this industry and preserving it for adults who choose to engage in games of skill like poker. An unenforceable, unpopular prohibition provides none of these benefits. All prohibition can do is drive players underground or overseas while limiting my personal freedom. What's most important to me is your support for my rights. Please respond to this letter and let me know if you will support keeping our state in this important program. I will be watching your actions on this issue closely. I hope that I, along with my over one million fellow Poker Players Alliance members can count on your support. Thank you for your consideration.

This company threatens our water, our environment, the air that your & my family breathe.  This company's smokestack will be located 2 to 8 miles from twelve, yes 12, of our schools.  Don't pollute the air we breathe like  California & force us the modify our cars because because there's just too much junk going into the air. 
I ask you to consider my words....Thanks

Subject: Titan cement plant

Comment: I am not in favor of Titan Cement receiving permission to reopen an idle cement plant located on the Cape Fear River just upstream of Wilmington. I consider this to be an extremely polluting industry which seems well enough supplied by other cement plants in our vicinity. To me, the economic benefits of reopening this plant would be greatly outweighed by the environmental damage. Count me strongly against this project, but I'm interested in the governor's stand on this issue.

There is no good that can come from trading the health of our community, especially the children that will be going to school near the plant for 49 new jobs. Titan will ruin our city's tourism industry. It will reduce our property values. I am a New Hanover county voter and I am asking you to put an end to the possibility of Titan.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing as a concerned citizen regarding the Titan Cement Plant.  My family and I live in Wilmington, NC and have followed this project and educated ourselves on the impacts of this devastating project that will have widespread effects on our quality of life.  The heavy pollution and contamination of our air and water quality in Wilmington will be unacceptable and unlivable if this plant is not stopped and allowed to come.  We have three young children ages 10, 8, and 4, and are highly concerned for our family's future health.  One of our children already has severe allergies and asthma.  This plant will be one of the largest sources of air pollution in our area.   New Hanover County already has some of the highest toxic emissions in North Carolina.  


We do not want Titan in our community.  The environmental destruction, pollution of our air and water, and health risks violate the protective provisions of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.  Titan should be held to the SEPA and EPA laws.  We have the right to breathe clean air and water, and not have our basic human rights taken away from us.  The proposed Titan plant is just 6 miles from our home.  Our oldest son has also just been redistricted to attend school one mile from the plant next year.  8,700 school children will attend schools within close proximity.  This plant so close to our home and community is unacceptable, and we strongly urge you to stand up against this project.  Our communities precious resources and the health of its citizens should not be sold out for cheap cement.  Eighty percent of cement plants have had violations over the last five years.  Titan cement has had numerous violations at their plants in Virginia and Florida.  The impacts of this plant are unacceptable, and we do not want to have to leave the area.  My husband owns a business here that would also make it very difficult for us to leave the area as well.  This is our home where we work, live, attend church, and live close by to family. Please stand up and do everything you can to protect your citizens and our community.  Our beautiful coastal city and the health of its citizens is counting on you.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Nicole Rollins

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research an! d I know Carolinas Cement and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Benjamin Schmitt

I am a resident of North Carolina and wish to express my support for the proposed Carolinas Cement plant to be built in Castle Hayne, N.C. I supported the issuance of the Draft Air Permit to Carolinas Cement and I support the issuance of the official Air Permit without delay.

A cement plant in North Carolina will have positive effects in our community in a number of ways, such as mitigating the potential shortage of this strategic material and controlling competition for foreign imports (e.g., Venezuela, Columbia and China). Greater choice of supply will impact cost on every building project, major sewer system or large scale highway project in the state, making scarce state and county funds go further while shrinking the carbon footprint associated with importing cement from overseas.

I have done my research and I know Carolinas Cem! ent and its parent company, Titan America LLC, to be organizations of great integrity with an excellent reputation for community involvement and environmental stewardship. I trust that current federal and state regulations will protect our health and safety. We, in North Carolina, are in desperate need of the jobs, revenue and taxes this project will generate. Additional information about the project is available at www.carolinascement.com.

I urge you to support Carolinas Cement and the issuance of the Air Permit without delay.

Sincerely,
Darrell Barbee
