Subject: Smoking Ban

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue: First of all, thank you for everything you do to make North Carolina a great place to live and work! I am a musician who plays long hours in smoky bars and restaurants. I cannot tolerate second-hand smoke. I have bronchial problems, stemming from my childhood, where I spent many hours trapped in the back seat of a vehicle with chain-smoking parents. I have heard the defense for not banning smoking, and none of the excuses hold up to reason. Paul Stone, president and CEO of the N.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association, who is against a ban, talks about how restaurants would suffer because there are "family friendly" places with bars that allow smoking where people would take their family to eat instead. What is "family friendly" about exposing your children (or anyone) to second-hand smoke? Another excuse offered by Rep. Cary Allred, a Burlington Republican, was that we should outlaw fatty foods as well, because we can't give one health hazard priority over another. Yes we can! If I choose to eat fatty foods, it does not affect the person(s) sitting in the next booth, or the worker who has to inhale second-hand smoke for hours at a time while on the job! The worker's right to work is more important than a smoker's right to smoke, as some would suggest that "nobody is forcing them to work there...go work somewhere else!" That is not a valid argument! Smokers will not change their habit. They are ADDICTED! And there is safety in numbers! Why must I continue to suffer, and STINK to high heaven when I leave a smoking establishment? The truth is (and you can check other state records where smoking is not allowed in public places), if there were a ban, the playing field would be leveled, and nobody's business would be affected because it would be required of everyone. This is not an issue of "rights" or punishing the tobacco industry! Breathing and staying healthy is the only right that is being violated here...that's all I'm asking! Please continue this fight! I suspect though, that the deciding factor in this battle is not "smokers' rights", but BIG TOBACCO REVENUES AND UNDER-THE-TABLE LOBBYIST FUNDING! With due respect, again, to all our honest and hard-working public servants, I hope I am not correct!

Subject: Protect Private Property Rights in North Carolina

Comment: Again this session, the North Carolina legislature is considering a radical smoking ban bill. House Bill 2, "Prohibit Smoking in Public and Work Places" would ban smoking on private property. This is a serious property rights violation. House Bill 2 takes a legal activity - smoking - and makes it illegal on private property. House Bill 2 would make it unlawful for a business owner to smoke in his place of business - even if he is the only employee! In states and municipalities where similar smoking bans have been put in place, small business owners have suffered economic losses. Please take a stand for private property rights and vote against a public smoking ban for North Carolina. Sincerely, Terry Erb

Comment: Ms.Perdue, Please ban smoking in all eatting places and all bars,secound hand smoke is very dangerous,the city of New York banned smoking in both of these places and there sales went up 8 precent,why stop smoking in a eatting place and not a bar-that does not make sence,I have asthma and can not go any where that has smoking.I would like to go to a bar and have a cold beer but can't due to all the secound hand smoke,smoke is bad any where people are,so it should be banned in all places,people will go to bars even if you can't smoke and it's not fair to let them have smoking and ban it at other places,veto this bill and ban smoking at all places-that would be the right thing to do.

Subject: Smoking Ban.

Comment: This is only one of over 400 articles / studies that show/prove the myth of SHS being dangerous is false and kills business. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT SUBCOMMITTEE STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS J. BLILEY, JR. JULY 21, 1993 Mr. Chairman, I am testifying today in order to report to the Subcommittee the results of my extensive investigation of the EPA's handling of the controversy surrounding environmental tobacco smoke or "ETS". As you know, in the past the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of this Committee has conducted hearings on EPA's abuses of government contracting requirements. So pervasive is the level of abuse that Chairman Dingell has characterized EPA's pattern of contract mismanagement as a "cesspool". EPA's Inspector General recently has confirmed that such abuses also have taken place in connection with a number of EPA contracts involving ETS, and the O and I Subcommittee's own investigation is continuing. In addition to various contractual improprieties, however, my own investigation suggests that in its consideration of ETS, the Agency has deliberately abused and manipulated the scientific data in order to reach a predetermined, politically motivated result. EPA's risk assessment on ETS released in January of this year claims that ETS exposure is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer cases per year in the United States. Analysis of the risk assessment reveals, however, that EPA was able to reach that conclusion only by ignoring or discounting major studies, and by deviating from generally accepted scientific standards. EPA's willingness to distort the science in order to justify its classification of ETS as a "Group A" or "known human" carcinogen seems to stem from the Agency's determination early on to advocate smoking bans and restrictions as a socially desirable goal. EPA began promoting such policies in the mid-to late 1980s, ostensibly as part of its efforts to provide information to the public on indoor air quality issues. The Agency then decided to develop the ETS risk assessment to provide a scientific justification for smoking bans. The risk assessment thus was never intended to be a neutral review and analysis of the ETS science. Rather, it was intended from the start to function as a prop for the Agency's predetermined policy. Not surprisingly, therefore, the process at every turn has been characterized by both scientific and procedural irregularities. In addition to the contracting violations mentioned at the outset, those irregularities include conflicts of interest by both Agency staff involved in preparation of the risk assessment and the members of the Science Advisory Board panel selected to provide a supposedly independent evaluation of the document. I will not itemize each and every one of these improprieties. Instead, I ask consent that a memorandum providing full details of the history of EPA's handling of ETS be included in the record. The memorandum summarizes the results thus far of my investigation into the Agency's handling of ETS and is based on publicly available documents, extensive correspondence between myself and former Administrator Reilly, and interviews conducted by my staff with the responsible EPA officials. there is more... http://www.pipes.org/Articles/Bliley.html

Comment: Smoking in restaurants should be for the owner to decide. Lawmakers should not be able to decide that for them. If you sign this bill into law, it would mean that the government does not care about our freedoms. I voted for you and think that if you sign this bill your chances of getting voted in again are very slim. North Carolina is a tobacco state and should be kept that way. If people dont want to be around smoke, they dont have to, they decide which place they want to eat at, and its their choice if they want to be around smoke or not. Signing this bill would slow business down for many restaurants. Please think about this before you make your choice.

Comment: Just got a tweet stating that the NC lawmakers just approved a smoking ban in restaurants and bars.. Isn't that a little harsh .. don't the restaurant and bar owners have a say in their own businesses? Wouldn't it have been better to require each restaurant and/or bar to post a large sign on their door stating there is smoking inside??? Enter at your own risk. After all, presently both have the choice of posting "no smoking" signs on their doors- if that is their choice.. Who made Raleigh the moral protectors of all citizen and business owners?? It doesn't affect me which way YOU enact this .. but taking away a right of choice in anything DOES affect me. This ISN'T nazi germany where citizens are TOLD "what" to do, "when" to do it or be arrested for following a simple right to make their own choice... or is it?? Is Raleigh now telling taxpaying citizens what to do in their personal life or in their businesses? I thought the 14th Amendment states that No state may make any law abridging the privileges of citizens..

Even the state of Virginia wasn't this barbaric in their smoking ban. People will lose business and we don't need anymore people on unemployment. I am a non smoker and have never felt we needed a law,this should be common sense where you work, dine or drink. But, if one has to be made, then this needs to be redone and be reasonable.

Comment: I cannot believe this smoking ban. Why has it become legal for the government to tell people how to live their lives? If I own a restaurant or bar (including the property) why is it ok for the government to tell me what to do inside my own building. Will the government be telling me I can not smoke in my home or I can not eat a cheeseburger because it is not healthy? What about alcohol - it's bad for you, can cause damage during pregnancy, gives cause for men and women to act out in public, etc.. Why is alcohol not banned from restaurants, events, etc? The government is becoming much too involved in our everyday, personal lives. I understand we need laws to govern and protect people, however, we still need our basic rights and unfortunately, it seems every time you turn around these days they are being taken away. Shouldn't banning smoking in a restaurant or bar be up to the owner? If a person does not like smoke, they can choose to go somewhere else. If a person wants to smoke and the establishment doesn't allow it, that person can choose somewhere else. Please, stop the madness! Allow people the basic right to choose.

Subject: SMOKING BAN

Comment: I am allergic to cigarette smoke, my throat seizes up and I can not breath. Thank you and the state politicians for finally overcoming tobacco money and voting to keep your citizens health a top priority. I hope Ms. Perdue signs the bill soon and it goes into effect as soon as possible. I will be able to go many places without fear. I still have to hold my breath go get by smoking at entry doors. Maybe that can be the next item addressed by the concerned NC political employees (we pay them dont we?) thank you

Comment: I, for one, am appalled you would even consider passing a smoking ban in NC. If you want the opinions of many, many more people, please check out WXII TV's site. You're taking away a right of citizens but giving them the right to drink and drive! Makes no sense to me! I grew up in NC with RJR being one of the best employers in the state. You're putting them out of business along with many, many bars and restaurants. I will keep my smokey money at home along with many others. I will also make sure I do not vote for any of the "elected" officials that voted yes to pass this. You MUST reconsider this ban!!! I have a right to smoke just as much as people have a right not to. Maybe I don't like their smell either!! Can you ban that???!!!! Upset, yes I am. I work my tail off everyday just to try to keep my head above water with all the rising prices you need to start taking control of. Stressed, yes, and smoking eases that stress. Addicted, I'm sure, but at least it's a legal drug and it's the only one I do. You must reconsider signing this bill into law. Thank you for your time, Vickie Lawrence

Subject: NC Needs Smoke-free

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: As your constituent, I urge you to restore HB 2 to its original form. HB 2, as approved by the House, will not protect the public from the dangers of secondhand smoke exposure and must be corrected. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a health hazard that causes or makes worse a wide range of adverse health effects, including heart attacks, cancer, and asthma. I believe that all workers should be protected from secondhand smoke in the workplace. The original intent of HB 2 was not to protect only minors; it was to protect all workers and the public from the dangers of secondhand smoke. The fairest system is one that levels the playing field for all worksites - including restaurants and bars. Every workplace should be smoke-free. One worker's health is not more worthy of protection from secondhand smoke than another's. In addition to saving lives, smoke-free policies save health care costs. A recent study in Pueblo, Colorado found the rate of heart attacks declined 41% after a smoke-free law went into effect. Not only did fewer people have heart attacks, but this had a rippling effect on public and private health care costs. We can't afford to wait any longer to breathe smoke-free indoor air. I urge you to support a strong and fair version of HB 2 - remove the House amendments and vote yes to making virtually all indoor worksites and public places smoke-free in North Carolina. Sincerely, Pam Palmer 1161 Wimbleton Dr Raleigh, NC 27609-4368

Subject: Smoking Ban

Comment: Madam Governor, While you have made your personal desires clear regarding the "smoking ban", we must consider the fact that this legislation is an infringement on private property rights and further denies the public its choice on an active topic. Our economic system is built on individual citizens making choices that best fit their wants, desires, and needs. Whether these citizens are business owners, employees or consumers, they are given choices. Business owners have already begun responding to the wishes of their employees and customers by deciding on smoking policies. And quite frankly, for every bar or restaurant that allows smoking, there is another similar establishment just down the street that is non-smoking. Regarding the dangers of secondhand smoke, as I understand it, OSHA has already made rulings that declare such smoke to be insignificant as to warrant regulation. While some have stated that employees must be protected, let us not forget that the same employee applied for the job knowing the existing smoking policy. The same employee has the right to work somewhere else. That is how our system was designed to work. The point is, customers and employees have a choice as individual businesses are already addressing this topic with their respective clientele. For government to intervene is heavy-handed, an intrusion, and quite frankly, unnecessary. I urge you to protect the rights of our citizens to make choices instead of “giving in” to special interest groups. I urge you to veto the “smoking ban” legislation. Thank you.

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, Do you not realize that North Carolina's economy has thrived on tobacco" First the "sin" taxes, and now you're encouraging banning all smoking in restaurants. Ma'am, what you are doing is political suicide in this state - be ye forewarned. There are other ways to effectively legislate ways to reduce secondhand smoke exposure. Not only are you pitting NC residents against each other, but you are taking away the rights of business owners. Have you thought about how the decrease revenue is going to effect our economy? The educational lottery fund can only be raided so many times before that, too taps out. I urge to reconsider this ban and seek out more business friendly laws. Morrissa Walters

Comment: I'm just curious as to were the North Carolina government fills the need to take away our right as adults to choose were and were not to smoke... Family locations I understand, but any place where adults (old enough to choose whether to walk into these establishments in the first place) can gather should be left up to the Business owners. They chose to open these businesses and allow smoking. The government didn't pay them to open and they (the government )also licensed them and taxed them. Now you want to control them further.. Why? for the health of people that can make their own choices. Just tell them not to go in these places... Doing that would be the same as telling us smokers not to smoke in them... Oh but that would be infinging on their rights wouldn't it. I know health care cost and the health of americans are concerns of everyone, but the right to choose is americas law.

How long until we are bar coded and implanted with GPS? Glad you worked hard to find a happy median... You have lost my vote that is 100% sure. And the votes of all my friends and most of my co-workers. This is a sad sad day for NC, a state founded on tobacco farmers backs. Its good to know that our freedoms can just be stripped away from us.

Comment: Who, Exactly, Do you think you are? What right do YOU have to dictate what business owners do in their own establishment? I am a small business owner, and, if you allow this smoking bill to pass, you are nothing more than a communist, trying to once again, dictate thru your gov. title what people can do. I am NOT a smoker, but, they have rights too....and it's not up to your gov. title to tell anyone, when & where they can smoke when it comes to inside restaurants, especially, when they have different sections, or the rest. chooses not to allow it. IT is their decision, NOT Governments!!!!! Non-smokers also have a choice of not attending a restaurant of their liking, if smoking so offends them...and in my experience, it has never even been an issue. You will never get another vote from me....I am so sick of stupid crooks buying one another their little votes. I'm sure it will come to light what was paid off for this vote...hope you enjoy it now! The truth will come out!

Subject: smoking bill

Comment: This is an amazing bill with the public health of North Carolina at heart. I hope that the media speculation is correct and that Governor Purdue will sign this bill into law. Already there is a lot of ignorant backlash, citing personal freedoms on private property, etc. What these people fail to realize, and what I hope the Governor can see, is that smoking is not private. Smoking impairs the health of all those who are exposed to it, both first-hand and second-hand smoke. The British Medical Journal as published many articles (among them Published 5 April 2004) citing a decrease in hospital admissions for heart attack and stroke (1st and 3rd leading cause of death in America respectively) after a public smoking ban was enacted. In such horrible economic times when our own public teachers are receiving pay cuts, we need to address this public health crisis and stop millions of public dollars from going to help treat people after they have diseases that could have been prevented with a simple law.

Comment: Please do not sign this when it moves across your desk this week. We have enough people out of work and depressed and we do not need more government telling "we the people" what we can and cannot do. Smokers no longer seem to have any rights. Petions in a restaurant or bar served the situation just fine but you just cannot seem to please some people. Make it fair to all, not some. I am currently in the process of quiting smoking and I hope that I succeed but I will not now or ever frequent an establishment that does not allow smoking. It just isn't fair. Smoking sections was the right idea so go back to that idea before compounding a bad situation to even a worse one. I would never impose my smoking on someone else and I do not like the idea of someone else imposing their non-smoking on me or any one else. Whats next? Fat people will be asked to leave a restaurant because they are fat and offend others whom just want to eat "normally". The last thing that our unemployed tobbacco and textile workers need is a bunch of snobs dictating to them. Its only going to hurt what little business that these small business owners have left. Its certainly not going to stop people from smoking. If you don't want to eat in a restaurant that has smoking...just don't go there. Pretty simple..you would think and to take it out of bars is verging on madness. Thats what people do in bars. Pleas Governor Perdue, rethink this and be fair to all people.

Comment: I am calling on the governor to veto the new law that would ban smoking in bars and restaurants. There are enough laws to protect non-smokers now. The new laws would be an infringment on the rights of business owners. I don't like the smell of some perfumes and at times the smell has given my wife severe headaches. Some have even experienced asthma attacks from the smell of these sickening health degenerative liquids. I think it is time to outlaw perfume. After all, no one has a "right" to use perfume. And why should you be able to use these caustic smelly odors at the risk of my and my family’s health? No one really knows how much harm my lungs have experienced from smelling these sickening perfumes. It is time to put these perfume factories out of business. How can anyone work in the perfume industry knowing you are killing innocent human beings? I call on the governor and the legislation to put an end to this madness. There should be laws to protect me and my family from the dangers of smelling perfume. At the less, there should be perfume and non-perfume seating in restaurants. I hope you get the drift of where this could lead us. Sincerely, Daniel Shumate

Comment: As a citizen and tax payer of North Carolina, I feel that smokers are being discriminated against! I feel that we should have just as many rights as these people who claim to be so harmed by our so called second hand smoke. Where is our freedom of self expression, personal choices and our right to be an individual as tax paying citizens. I myself go out of my way to respect non-smokers, but if I am going to continue to pay taxes in North Carolina and remain an upstanding citizen then I feel I have the right to smoke. These same people for the most part do not mind getting in their cars and driving home after having several drinks at these same restuarants, but then again they aren't trying to get that right taken away. I think there a more serious issues that could be addressed other than attacking hard working Americans for the way they choose to spend their money! How much money is made from tobacco in North Carolina? One would think that these people would find other things to complain about. Stop targeting out certain groups of people for their choices, or begin to target all! It's not right to try and take our rights! We work, pay taxes, and we are sick of the discrimination against us!

Subject: smoking ban

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I just heard on the news where the smoking ban was approved. I am not a smoker, I think cigarettes are disgusting; however I think it is time that we leave the smokers alone and start focusing on all the alcohol problems we have in our state. Alcohol has contributed to so many deaths (most of those of people who were not drinking), raised vehicle insurance rates and destroyed so many lives. Kids today are drinking at younger and younger ages. Beer companies are allowed to promote alcoholism during every sport. If you go to professional ballgames there are drunks running around everywhere (even here in Asheville where the Tourists play). I can't recall ever reading where someone smoked a carton of cigarettes and then went driving and hit someone because their nicotine level was too high; but I read everyday where some drunk (even a first time drunk) has hit and killed some poor family that was heading home. Even at some of colleges we have drive-thru convenience stores (for beer of course) - check out the one at Western Carolina University. Our court system is full of cases of alcoholics driving while impaired and driving with license revoked (because they were DWI). Unfortunately, these cases get drug out over months and sometimes years costing the counties and state money. If people want to smoke and develop cancer, that's their right. I don't have a problem either moving or asking them to move if they smoke around me. I think stopping drunks is far more important than stopping smokers. Maybe passing a law or two regarding alcohol would hurt too many politicians, I don't know; but, just think of all the money the state could make if they raised the tax on alcohol every year. Perhaps there would be fewer people drinking. Lives would be saved. Homes would be kept together.

Comment: I am asking that you do not sign the smoking bill into law. I ask that you please allow business owners to be able to choose whether they will allow smoking in their business or not. I feel that a business owner should have the right to make this decision for their facility. I am now a non-smoker, but was a smoker for many years. I feel that making every business smoke-free is a violation of the rights of business owners as well as smokers. I also personally feel that I should have the right to choose when deciding to visit a business that is smoking or non-smoking. If I want to go out to eat, I should be allowed to choose which restaurant to visit, regardless of whether it is smoking or non-smoking. Also, I feel that if you say small businesses cannot allow smoking, then you are intentionally hurting some of the small mom and pop restaurants and bars that generally have smoking clientele. These small businesses are what made our state and they have had to fight large corporations to stay in business but if you tell them they cannot allow smoking then you will be putting the final nail in their coffin. I do agree that non-smokers have rights...but smokers have rights to. I also understand the health consequences, but I feel that the ban will only cause more people to either stay at home or smoke outside. Please say no to banning smoking in all businesses and allow the owners to make their own choice. Thank you.

Comment: PLEASE do not sign this into law!!! It is so unfair to smokers and business owb=ners who allow smoking!! I moved back to NC from Florida because I figured it would be the last bastion of smokers' rights. Now I learn about this smoking ban. My husband and I already don't go out much, but when we do, we patronize bars and restaurants that allow smoking. Don't you think this ban is going to hurt a LOT of businesses?? We are not the only smokers left in this state. At LEAST make it so restaurants and bars can allow outdoor smoking or smoking in a separate place. We will NOT be spending any $$$ in places that don't allow smoking. PLEASE consider your smoking constituents and bar and restaurant owners who welcome us!! Sincerely, Clare W Martin

Subject: Smoking Ban

Comment: Governor Perdue, The state legislature has just passed a bill that will force North Carolina's Hookah Bars to close. There are no less than 20 Hookah Bars in the state, employing around 10 people and producing approximately $100,000 in annual tax revenue. The bill includes exemptions for country clubs and cigar bars but shows no mercy to Hookah Bars. Hookah Bars are not substantially different from cigar bars in any way other than the method of tobacco consumption. Tobacco consumption through Hookah use is demonstrably less harmful than cigarette or cigar use due to the differences in smoke composition and relative infrequency of use. While the World Health Organization has released a study of the toxin consumption possible from an one hour Hookah session, the parameters of the study are unrepresentative of a typical Hookah session and are not an accurate representation. Furthermore, risks posed by second hand smoke exposure resulting from Hookahs are significantly different than the risks posed by cigarettes or cigars. Hookahs do not produce smoke continuously as cigarettes and cigars do. This fact reduces both the quantity and quality of second hand smoke produced by Hookah smoking as compared to cigarettes and cigars. Second hand smoke from a Hookah passes through the Hookah's filtration system while second hand smoke from cigarettes and cigars does not. Thus providing an exception for cigar bars and not Hookah Bars is irrational from the standpoint of public health, and unjust from any standpoint. As a long time heavy smoker I cannot express the depth of my gratitude for the existence of Hookah Bars. In 2005 I transitioned from smoking cigarettes to smoking Hookahs, within a month my cough was gone! The other negative health effects I experienced as a result of my decision to smoke cigarettes diminished or vanished. Academic research aside I can tell you from personal experience that Hookah smoking is less harmful than smoking cigarettes. Please do not sign the smoking ban. I am a life long Democrat and excited about your election and the potential good you can do for this state. However, I cannot support anyone of any party who threatens my health by eliminating Hookah as an alternative to cigarettes. The provisions of this bill is ill-conceived, irrational, unjust. Please do not make this bill into law. Thank you for your time and consideration, Garrett Lagan. gklagan@gmail.com 828-450-7564

Subject: Thanks for supporting Public smoking ban!

Comment: Governor Perdue, I would like to personally say thank you for supporting the ban on public smoking. I personally have family members who suffer from asthma, and serious allergies. I know that it is not only an annoyance for them to set down where others are smoking all around them - it's actually a health risk for them. Even if the business has a designated smoking area - the smoke still goes all over the building. Smoking is also a cleanliness issue because the tar and nicotine builds up on exposed surfaces, and causes a yellow or brownish, oily film over time. Last but not least - public smoking exposes small children to the harmful smoke produced by cigarettes. Banning smoking in public will surely make NC's public dining, and entertainment establishments a more enjoyable, healthier place for everyone. Thank You, Sincerely, A Bev Perdue supporter and voter, Lenard C McLean Jacksonville NC (910) 455-9693

Comment: My deepest sympathies, you are now a victim of the RWJF aka J&J who funds smoking bans and profits from their own nicotine (nicotine for nicotine) You are joining my state of Ohio in the destruction of your state business owners and will be pushing big pharma nicotine. Big pharma will laugh all the way to the bank wile your own state business owners go down the drain along with constitutional private property rights. Congratulations, you, like Ohio, never ask for proof of their fraudulent health claims. Sucker!!! you will suffer as Ohio is and you will deserve it. The SmokeLess States Program 2005 By: Gerlach KK and Larkin MA This chapter describes SmokeLess States®: National Tobacco Policy Initiative, one of the largest investments made by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, with $99 million authorized in grants since 1992. Primarily, grants were awarded to non-governmental organizations, with the intention that they would educate the public and policy-makers about the tobacco problem. Two features about the program are significant: (1) the Foundation encouraged its grantees to be activists; (2) advocacy was emphasized to bring about policy change. The program relied heavily on three major health voluntary organizations: the American Cancer Society; the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. They provided financial support and, in particular, funds to help lobbying efforts which the Foundation could not support directly. In addition to insight on the effects of advocacy, this chapter offers a window into the role of coalitions in bringing about social change. The program ended in 2004 and its lasting impact has yet to be determined. http://www.rwjf.org/pr/product.jsp?ia=143&id=14912 Oh well, its your state to destroy...sucker

This one offends me deeply. It has affected my family and many other families in North Carolina. My first wife and I were married in 1969. I was twenty-one and she was just out of high school at eighteen. We worked and did all the things a young married couple would do. After transferring around with the company I worked with, we settled in North Carolina in 1975. In 1977 our first child was born. In 1983 our second child was born. My current wife moved here from California. She has two children from a previous marriage. Her dad was a successful attorney in California. After a hitch in the Air Force, coming home, working hard to support a young family, going to college and then to law school, he began practicing law. My first wife passed away at the age of forty-one. My current wife's dad was disbarred and passed away in his mid fifties. Both of them were victims of alcohol. Neither of them was able to see their children or grandchildren grow up, go to college and do things every parent wants their children to do. My wife now only remembers certain parts of her childhood. She has blocked out many parts that had to do with her dad's drinking. Neither my wife nor I drink. We are offended by the smell of alcohol and we should not have to worry about a drunk driver if we are on the road. I realize smoking is the evil one with the current law that was passed, but I think too, that you need to consider all North Carolinians when you start passing laws. I honestly believe it is a good thing if the owner wants to ban smoking in their place of business. I do not believe the government, at any level, should be involved, but, since you have opened that Pandora's Box, let's go all the way. I'm asking you now to start drafting legislation to stop the sale of alcohol in all family restaurants and at all sporting events. As offended as others are at the smell of cigarettes, I'm equally, if not more so offended at the smell of alcohol. I don't think I need to remind you of the dangers of driving after visiting either of these places and having one to many drinks. I hope to read soon that you have begun drafting a bill to take care of the above item. Once that law is passed, we can start on the sale of alcohol at government owned ABC stores.

Comment: Governor Perdue, I am a non-smoker and I can't believe that that you would personally sign and take away the rights of smokers across North Carolina that want to go into a Bar and smoke. Every Bar or Club and Restaurant should have the right to establish the rules for their own establishment. This is outrageous and it takes away the freedom of the people. I urge you, PLEASE DO NOT sign this bill. I was once a smoker and quit several years ago and I have no plans of starting again, but I do believe that people should be able to smoke in some public places. Please rethink this issue that you have supported and don't take away the freedom of smoking completely. Thank you.
