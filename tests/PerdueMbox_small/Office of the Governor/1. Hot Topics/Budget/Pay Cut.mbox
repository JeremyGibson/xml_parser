Subject: .5% pay cut

Comment: My annual salary is approximately $46,000 per year. I am paid over a 12 month period, so before taxes my salary is approximately 3833.00 a month. My salary cut will remove $2,300 over the next 2 months - 1,150 from my May pay check - I will assume pre-taxed, and 1,150 from my June Paycheck - again I will assume pre-taxed. So if my base salary is 3833.00 - 1150.00 for the months of May and June - this leaves 2683 taxable income for both May and June - now - My check deductions usually run around 28% so - If I remove another 28% for taxes and deductions - this leaves me with a take home salary for the months of May and June of $2,012 dollars per month. My monthly bills are $1,406 dollars leaving $600 to pay for Groceries and Gas. My grocery bill is usually around $150.00 per week - and now suddenly - with good budget planning I realize that I probably will be fine with this large amount of money being removed from my paycheck over the next two months. However, I fear most do not have a budget plan - How are people going to pay their bills over the next 2 months? I know that taking a chunk of my pay check is better than losing my job but I just want you to know that a lot of teachers and state employees out there are going to be struggling to make ends meet for the next 2 months. Some of them will not have enough money left in their paychecks to cover their monthly bills. I can not imagine how difficult it is going to be for them to play catch-up on their bills July, August and September. Thank-you for allowing me to vent during these difficult times. Susan Whittemore, Developmental Science Instructor, Gaston College.

Comment: Please disregard previous message. I am one of the many who have a complete misunderstanding about amount of money taken out of check. Please know that I think you are doing a fine job, and by the way - your speach at Gaston College Graduation was very inspiring.

Subject: payroll deduction/insurance changes

Comment: Why is Gov. Perdue targeting our families? We as nurses don't make alot of money and we have to give 0.5% of our annual salaries--but elected employees who make a lot more money they don't have to pay. It doesn't make sense to hurt your nurses and teachers. Who is going to help me pay my bills and support my children? I am a single mother of three boys and get NO help from the state in anyway. I pay more than my fair share of taxes and yet I get screwed again. Enough is enough. We voted for you and I think that was the biggest mistake I ever made. And I promise next election the nurses and teachers will be heard.

Subject: NC Mandatory Salary Reduction

Comment: So I just had my paycheck reduced by $150, which is tantamount to two different bills, that I now won't be able to pay. So I just wanted to say thanks so much!!! I'm so glad I voted for you so I can get ripped off even more. Way to reaffirm my faith in the political system. Out of curiosity, how much does Bev's paycheck get reduced this month and next month???
