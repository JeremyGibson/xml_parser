Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Hope Marasco (919) 619-0796

I understand we are facing an economic crisis and that you have had to make several difficult decisions. I want to applaud you for making the tough decision to furlough state employees in order to save jobs and balance the budget. But more action is needed. I am writing to ask you to encourage the legislature to raise the revenue needed to balance the budget and make the investments needed en ensure that NC continues to be a great state in the future. This means raising a significant amount of revenues to help mitigate the impact of potentially devastating budget cuts. The current proposals to balance the state budget with cuts alone would devastate North Carolina's economy, communities, and families. Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past.

The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. The decision to encourage biotechology industry in the hopes that it may help our economy is disasterous. This is unregulated and each new scientific study on adverse affects on health and environment is terrifying. Foreign countries do not even want these products. Please restore cuts to environmental regulation and Medicaid. Medicaid is going back and refusing to pay for medical services that have already been rendered to Medicaid recipients. This puts the doctor in the position of having to pay for these services or the patient oweing the doctor for unexpected expenses. It also jeapardizes doctor/patient relations. Worse it seems the state is commiting fraud in not honoring these debts. Medicaid is also refusing needed medical services and refusing to allow reconsideration or appeal of their decisions. This too is dishonorable and should be investigated. Sincerely, Elizabeth O'Nan 828 724 4221

Revenue must be part of the solution. There are many areas where continued public help is very important: health care for children, mental health, and affordable housing. Please consider solving North Carolina's budget shortfall by raising revenue in addition to making wise spending choices. As Paul Krugman mentioned in a recent article about the decline of California, we don't want our state to ultimately become a banana republic. We need to continue our history of public investment.

Subject: New Revenues Must be Part of the Budget Solution

Comment: Don Rogers 141 Bruce Circle Pisgah Forest, NC 28768-8839 May 27, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: The current proposals to balance the state budget with cuts alone would devastate North Carolina's economy, communities, and families. Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Don Rogers 828-883-8911
