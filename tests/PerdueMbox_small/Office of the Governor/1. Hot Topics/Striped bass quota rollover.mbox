Subject: striper rollover

Comment: The striped bass rollover quota is politics and lobbying at it's worst. Basically insane and lacks any type of common sense. I grew up without striped bass. They were some mystical fish I had been told about. They rebounded...not because of great management(in spite of horrific overfishing and mismanagement - like we are seeing right now) but because people couldn't squeeze another dollar out of the stock. It was gone. This incredible recovery has now been placed in serious jeopardy by more lobbying and special interests. The short term over the long term. Very sad. Now my son may very well suffer the same fate I did. No stripers. My father had told me once that politicians are cowards and whores. They bow to the money and popular decisions even when they don't make sense. They cower in making unpopular decisions, even if they know it's right, and they whore after the money. If there ever was a clearer case than this I don't know what it is. Insanity. Destroying the stock again, and taking short term gains (poitically) over the long term, and a sustainable fishery... for all. Have we learned nothing? Looks like it...the American way it seems. The lack of common sense and care being taken here is American politics at it's worst. I am embarrassed and ashamed. Please make the common sense vote for a long term, viable fishery for all. Not just one group. Use some common sense and think long term. Please. Be UnAmerican in your thoughts and actions. Not to rollever quotas. The illegal catch, and undercounting isn't factored in, and as someone on the water constantly, that number is very large. Long term. Not short term. This is a short term, politically driven/speical interest lobbyist move. It makes no sense for anyone else involved, or the future of the fishey. Say NO to rollovers. Raise the fish size for rec fisherman. Be proactive for once! Don't be a typical American! Thomas Knapp 914-293-7016 Residing in Westchester County and soon to be Cohassett, Mass.

Subject: stripe bass quota roll over

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue On Nov. 2 the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission will vote on a proposal to allow the commercial striped bass quota that states fail to catch in one year to be added to the next year. I strongly disagree with this plan to kill more striped bass. Striped bass fishing has declined greatly in recent years, and it is already costing jobs in the guiding and tackle communities where the value of striped bass far exceeds commercial landings. The trend in spawning success is clearly down, and we should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass not to kill more . The proposed quota roll over would encourage under the table sales of striped bass that would not count against quotas. The striped bass commercial community has a proven history of doing just this kind of thing. It would be a poor policy to offer incentives for illegal activity. I urge you to direct our state fishery director to vote against this proposed quota roll-over at the upcoming meeting, and to direct him to look for ways to conserve striped bass for recreational angling rather than deplete them for commercial purposes. Sincerely, Dan Adkins

Governor Perdue

On November 2, the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission will vote on a proposal to allow half the commercial striped bass quota that states fail to catch in one year to be added to the next year.  CCA strongly disagrees with this plan to kill more striped bass. Striped bass fishing has declined greatly in recent years, and it is already costing jobs in the guiding and tackle communities where the value of striped bass far exceeds commercial landings.  

Our coastal communities are hurting enough and don't need any further degradation to the resource. Add to this argument that the majority of Striped Bass in NC have been historically caught in destructive fishing gear such as gill nets and trawls that indiscriminately kill and injure other marine species and mammals and I become further distressed by this state's reluctance to change its fisheries management practices. We should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass, not kill more.  

I urge you to direct our state fishery director Dr. Louis Daniel to vote against this proposed quota roll-over at the upcoming meeting, and to direct him to look for ways to conserve striped bass for recreational angling rather than deplete them for commercial purposes.

Quotas are set for a reason,to protect the resourse, if you can't meet the quota while trying it says to me that there are not enough fish present.  The common sense thing to do is maintain the quota as is, not increase it the next year with carryover.  Please give the fish a chance to rebuild.

If anything is to be done, the commercial quota should be reduced; being that the Striped Bass is far more important to the recreational fishing industry than to the commercial fishing industry.

Roll-over of unused cell phone minutes is one thing, since airwave time, once passed, are no longer available; however, roll-over of fishing limits totally defeats the purpose of conserving and expanding the wildlife population.  I certainly hope you see the difference and take appropriate action to conserve the striped bass population.

X-Folder: Striped bass quota rollover

Governor Perdue

On November 2, the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission will vote on a proposal to allow half the commercial striped bass quota that states fail to catch in one year to be added to the next year.  CCA strongly disagrees with this plan to kill more striped bass. Striped bass fishing has declined greatly in recent years, and it is already costing jobs in the guiding and tackle communities where the value of striped bass far exceeds commercial landings.  

Our coastal communities are hurting enough and don't need any further degradation to the resource. Add to this argument that the majority of Striped Bass in NC have been historically caught in destructive fishing gear such as gill nets and trawls that indiscriminately kill and injure other marine species and mammals and I become further distressed by this state's reluctance to change its fisheries management practices. We should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass, not kill more.  

I urge you to direct our state fishery director Dr. Louis Daniel to vote against this proposed quota roll-over at the upcoming meeting, and to direct him to look for ways to conserve striped bass for recreational angling rather than deplete them for commercial purposes.

As a tax payer in the state of North Carolina I urge you to start taking a closer look at how we protect our natural resources. Recreational fishing brings in a tremendous amount of revue and creates 1000's of jobs, yet we do the least of any state to stop overfishing. It is time to change that.

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Kenneth Buchanan

Address: 694 Methodist Church Rd, Elizabeth City, NC 27909

Email: buchanan_buck@hotmail.com

Subject: Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission

Comment: Dear Governor: On Nov. 2 the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission will vote on a proposal to allow the commercial striped bass quota that states fail to catch in one year to be added to the next year. I strongly disagree with this plan to kill more striped bass. Striped bass fishing has declined greatly in recent years, and it is already costing jobs in the guiding and tackle communities where the value of striped bass far exceeds commercial landings. The trend in spawning success is clearly down, and we should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass not to kill more . The proposed quota roll over would encourage under the table sales of striped bass that would not count against quotas. The striped bass commercial community has a proven history of doing just this kind of thing. It would be a poor policy to offer incentives for illegal activity. I urge you to direct our state fishery director to vote against this proposed quota roll-over at the upcoming meeting, and to direct him to look for ways to conserve striped bass for recreational angling rather than deplete them for commercial purposes.

Governor, Please don't allow a roll over of the Striped Bass quota. It will not be good for the fishery. I think CCA is on the right track.

As an avid fisherman I want to urge you to take action to ensure the future of our natural resources is not negatively impacted.  This vote is IMHO, a big step backwards.  Another example of MHO bad practices is netting in general.  When I go to the NC coast to fish for our state fish, it is at best a hit and miss affair.  While in SC and most other states, the redfish is flourishing - is it due to no netting...?

Add to this argument that the majority of Striped Bass in NC have been historically caught in destructive fishing gear such as gill nets and trawls that indiscriminately kill and injure other marine species and mammals and I become further distressed by this state's reluctance to change its fisheries management practices. We should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass, not kill more.  

I urge you to direct our state fishery director Dr. Louis Daniel to vote against this proposed quota roll-over at the upcoming meeting, and to direct him to look for ways to conserve striped bass for recreational angling rather than deplete them for commercial purposes.

Sincerely,

Governor Perdue

On November 2, the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission will vote on a proposal to allow half the commercial striped bass quota that states fail to catch in one year to be added to the next year.  CCA strongly disagrees with this plan to kill more striped bass. Striped bass fishing has declined greatly in recent years, and it is already costing jobs in the guiding and tackle communities where the value of striped bass far exceeds commercial landings.  

Our coastal communities are hurting enough and don't need any further degradation to the resource. Add to this argument that the majority of Striped Bass in NC have been historically caught in destructive fishing gear such as gill nets and trawls that indiscriminately kill and injure other marine species and mammals and I become further distressed by this state's reluctance to change its fisheries management practices. We should be looking for ways to conserve striped bass, not kill more.
