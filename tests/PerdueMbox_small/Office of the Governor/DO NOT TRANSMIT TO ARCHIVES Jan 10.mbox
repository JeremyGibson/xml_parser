Subject: next term

Comment: Governor Beverly Perdue, Before I get into the real reason I am writing to you, I owe you thanks. Thank you for running for office. Thank you for getting elected and most of all Thank You for the job you are doing. God bless you Beverly. On subject, however this is not pleasant for me and I donâ€™t expect it will be for you either. I am writing to you to let you know that the citizens of North Carolina are being abused. I have done some research and I will share that with you. Although, the people that I am representing on my own without their knowledge, are not perfect and have made mistakes to be the circumstances that I share with them, we are still citizens with rights and are doing what has been demanded of us to pay for our convictions. I am a DWI convict, and as such I have to pay a price to society for what I have done WRONG. I wrote wrong in capital letters for a reason. We are going to talk a lot about what is wrong and what is rightâ€¦ and how we determine the difference. To spare you a lot of boring details I am going to get straight to the point. This second time I have contacted your office about this. I have also contacted my congressional representatives. The DMV. The North Carolina Attorney Generalâ€™s Office. The U.S . Attorney Generalâ€™s Office, the White house. I think that is enough to get my point across. This is about Monitech, a company operating a monopoly. Not only are they a monopoly, they are criminal and I have proof and I can get more. Whatâ€™s worse is it involves the NCDMV a government agency that has lied to me on many more than one occasion. What I want is a face to face with you personally, preferably with the president or CEO of ManTech, a representative of the NC DMV, Most respected Susan Davis of the Consumer Protection Division of the NC Attorney Generalâ€™s office. Let me explain something to you that you do not know. Monitech has more power than you can imagine. I have interviewed more than 50 people that are subject to their abuse. If it was just me, Iâ€™d let it go but these people are living in fear of monitech and if I cannot get you to take actionâ€¦ and when I say take action I do not mean mediation. I mean fix this. Then I will go to Washington and I think that will be just as much a waste of my efforts as everything else I have done to this point. I mean you no disrespect. I admire you. I do want you to know that I will not stop at your office to make what I know is wrong, right. I have contacted many government officials that will be very embarrassed if we cannot get this done without involving press. AND, I want stop there. This is my second attempt to get your attention. I will not make a third. You should at least know what I know.

 [BAILOUT 51]  $ 14,400,000,000,000 and counting . . .
.
It wasn't going to be just a $700Billion Fix-it-all patch at the end of 2008 which Bush&Buckshot handed over to the Wall $treet Criminals who caused the Global Meltdown. 
.
Nope, that was just the trial run.  These Wall $treet MasterCons had much bigger plans in the works once they learned how to run their scams of US Taxpayers.
.
Now a year later, the total is up to $14.4 TRILLION, going to the same Wall $treet Criminals, plus still more to their Insurance buddies in the Healthcare Mafia.
.
Not one single Corporate Fascist who caused the Greatest Bank Heist in history has gone to jail, tho everyone knows who they are.
.
Question is:  why do YOU do business with any of these criminals?  For 2010, take your money out of Big Banks and move your accounts to member-owned Credit Unions, including your new, one (1) lower-cost credit card (that you will pay off each month).
.
To wrap up this Wall $treet RipOff, below is where your  $14.4 TRILLION has gone.
.
Who's going to pay for this?  Do you have to ask?
_________________________________

The Real Size of the Bail-Out
.
A guide to the abbreviations, acronyms, and obscure programs
that make up the $14.4 TRILLION federal Bailout of Wall $treet

(Mother Jones magazine, Dec. 21) -- The price tag for the Wall Street Bailout is often put at $700 billion -- the size of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). But TARP is just the best known program in an array of more than 30 overseen by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve that have paid out or put aside money to bail out financial firms and inject money into (free) markets. (Free is the operational word.) Below is a guide to many pieces of the puzzle:
.
Treasury Department bail-out programs

Money Market Mutual Fund: In September 2008, the Treasury announced that it would insure the holdings of publicly offered money market mutual funds. According to the "special inspector general" for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), these guarantees could have potentially cost the federal government more than $3 trillion.

Public-Private Investment Fund: This joint Treasury-Federal Reserve program bought toxic assets from banks and brokerages -- as much as $5 billion of assets per firm. According to the TARP special inspector general, the government's potential exposure from this fund is between $500 million and $1 trillion.

TARP: As part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Treasury has made loans to or investments more than 750 banks and financial institutions. $650 billion has been paid out (not including HAMP; see below). As of December 21, 2009, $117.5 billion of that has been re-paid.

Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) stock purchase: The Treasury has bought $200 million in preferred stock from Fannie Mae and another $200 million from Freddie Mac to show that they "will remain viable entities critical to the functioning of the housing and mortgage markets."

GSE mortgage-backed securities purchase: Under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the Treasury may buy mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to the TARP special inspector general, these purchases could cost as much as $314 billion.

Citigroup asset guarantee: In this joint Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC program, the government agreed to cover potential losses to a Citigroup asset pool worth $301 billion.

T-bill auctions to fund the Fed: In November 2008, the Treasury announced that it would borrow $260 billion to fund the Supplementary Financing Program, whose proceeds were deposited with the Federal Reserve.

TARP overpayment: This June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal government would lose $159 billion from its TARP loans and investments due to changes in their market value. (So far, Treasury has earned $14.4 billion in dividends from TARP.)

Bank of America asset guarantee: In this joint Treasury-Federal Reserve-FDIC program, the government agreed to cover potential losses to a Bank of America asset pool worth $118 billion. Bank of America has withdrawn from the program and has paid the government $425 million in compensation.

Potential international fund liabilities: In April, the United States committed up to $100 billion to fund the International Monetary Fund's lending and ensure that it "has adequate resources to play its central role in resolving and preventing the spread of international economic and financial crises."

The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) offers financial incentives to lenders to modify home loans. $75 billion in federal funds has been committed; $50 billion of that comes from TARP, and is set aside to modify mortgages not owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other government-sponsored entities.

Treasury exchange stabilization fund: A temporary program to insure the holdings of publicly offered money market mutual funds.

GSE credit facility program: Additional credit made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Expires December 31, 2009.


Federal Reserve bail-out programs

Commercial Paper Funding Facility: With the support from the Treasury, the Fed established the CPFF in October 2008 to increase the availability of short-term debt (commercial paper) funding. Up to $1.8 trillion was earmarked for the program.

Mortgage-backed securities purchase: In 2009, the Fed earmarked up to $1.25 trillion to buy investments based on home loans.

Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility: TALF provides financing to investors who are buying asset-backed securities. In February 2009, the Fed and Treasury announced an expansion of the program to generate up to $1 trillion in new lending.

Foreign Central Bank Currency Liquidity Swaps: The Fed has provided $755 billion for currency liquidity swaps with foreign central banks.

Money Market Investor Funding Facility: The MMIF was established in October 2008 to provide loans for investors buying certificates of deposit and commercial paper. According to the TARP special inspector general, $600 billion was allocated for the program.

Treasury Purchase Program: In March 2009, the Fed was authorized to purchase up to $300 billion of Treasury securities.

GSE Program: In March 2009, the Fed increased its purchases of debt from government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac) from $100 billion to $200 billion.

Primary Dealer Credit Facility: The PDCF provides overnight loans to primary dealers (financial firms that can engage in direct transactions with the federal government). The Fed allocated $147.7 billion for it in 2009.

The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) Liquidity Facility provides loans to financial institutions purchasing commercial paper from money market mutual funds. According to the TARP special inspector general, the Fed allocated $145.9 billion in 2009.

JPMorgan Chase/Lehman Brothers: In September 2008, the Fed gave JPMorgan Chase $148 billion in help the near-bankrupt Lehman Brothers.

Open Market Operations: In September 2008, the Fed injected $125 billion into the market by purchasing securities and re-purchase agreements (or repos), in which primary dealers borrow cash from the Fed.

Tri-Party Repurchase Agreements: The Fed provided $124.6 billion for this type of repo in 2009.

Primary Credit: The Fed provided $112 billion to offer loans at a discounted rate to eligible institutions in 2009.

Temporary Reserves: Between August and September 2007, the Fed made $93 billion of temporary reserves available for loans to financial firms.

Single-Tranche Repurchase Agreements: In 2009, the Fed offered a total of $80 billion for short-term loans to holders of mortgage-backed securities.

Term Auction Facility: Under TAF, the Fed auctions short-term loans to financial institutions. The amount of loans offered has varied widely; between December 2009 and January 2010, $75 billion in loans will be available.

AIG preferred stock interests, credit, and loan: The Fed provided $53 billion to the struggling AIG in various forms between 2008 and 2009.

AIG Securities Lending Facility: In October 2008, the Fed authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to borrow up to $37.8 billion in securities from AIG.

Maiden Lane II and III (AIG): In 2008, the Fed authorized its New York branch to form three limited liability companies: Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, and Maiden Lane III. It provided $52.5 billion to Maiden Lane II and III to assist AIG.

Maiden Lane I (Bear Stearns): The Fed provided $29.8 billion to Maiden Lane I to acquire Bear Stearns' assets and facilitate its merger with JPMorgan Chase.

TSLF: The Term Securities Lending Facility offers Treasury collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York so it can auction weekly loans to financial institutions. $25 billion in loans will be available between November 2009 and January 2010.

TOP: The TSLF Options Program allowed primary dealers to get TSLF loans in exchange for collateral. At the time of the program's termination in June 2009, $50 billion loans had been offered.

Expansion of system open market account securities lending: In July 2009, the Fed increased its limit for loans of securities to brokers from $3 billion to $5 billion, for a total of $36 billion in new lending.

JPMC/Bear Stearns Loan: The Fed provided a $12.9 billion bridge loan to JPMorgan Chase during its acquisition of Bear Stearns.

NOT INCLUDED:  More MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR costs:  for escalating the AfganWar;  for slowing catastrophic loses from Climate Change;  for slowing the murder and torture of Americans by the Healthcare Mafia;  for previous debt run up by Republican Presidents since Reagan;  AND for the day-to-day cost of running the Government, not including the INTEREST on all of this debt.
.
Welcome to the greatest Wall $treet Entitlement Program ever invented.
.
_____________________
.
Back when the World as we knew it was almost collapsed by greedy Wall $treet Bankers, when we were told this would cost us Taxpayers an unbelievable  $700,000 BILLION-- and might conceivably reach the then astronomical figure of ONE TRILLION DOLLARS -- I sat down to calculate how tall was a stack of a TRILLION One Dollar Bills.  You can read about it here:  <http://www.opednews.com/articles/How-can-you-visualize-a-tr-by-Gene-Messick-090103-512.html>How can you visualize a trillion dollars?
.
A stack of 1,000,000,000,000 greenbacks, in round numbers, is 63,000 miles high.
.
That was for TARP in 2008.  The 2009 stack of $14.4 TRILLION Dollar Bills would reach to the Moon almost 4 times, or there-and-back twice. 
.
That's just the Wall $treet RipOff for 2009, with no other outstanding bills included.
.
Here's the kicker:  This could be reduced significantly by a 50% tax on the net worth of the richest 10% of Americans, who lay claim to most of the wealth in America.
.
Click on <http://www.toomuchonline.org/inequality.html>Statistically Speaking from Too Much: An online weekly on excess and inequality.
.
They'd never miss it. And it's only fair:  the top 10% got what they have by stealing it from the rest of us ordinary folks.
.
"Take it back!" would be a great Resolution for the New Year!

	Please read the whole thing then as we head into 2010 please help me apply this to all we do this comming year



























Two Choices

What would you do?....you make the choice. Don't look for a punch line, there isn't one. Read it anyway. My question is: Would you have made the same choice?



At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning disabilities, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its

dedicated staff, he offered a question:

'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does, is done with perfection.

Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do.

Where is the natural order of things in my son?'



The audience was stilled by the query.



The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'

Then he told the following story:



Shay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' I knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but as a father I also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.



I approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'



Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my heart. The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted.

In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three.

In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I waved to him from the stands.

In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again.

Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.



At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?

Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.



However, as Shay stepped up to the

plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact.

The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed.

The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.

As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.



The game would now be over.

The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.

Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.



Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates.

Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first!

Run to first!'

Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base.

He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.



Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!'

Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.

B y the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball . the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team.

He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.

Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.



All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'



Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third!

Shay, run to third!'



As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, 'Shay, run home! Run home!'

Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team



'That day', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, 'the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world'.



Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making me so happy, and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!



AND NOW A LITTLE FOOT NOTE TO THIS STORY:

We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate.

The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.



If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren't the 'appropriate' ones to receive this type of message Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference.

We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.'

So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice:

Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?



A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it's least fortunate amongst them.



You now have two choices:

1. Delete

2. Forward

May your day, be a Shay Day.

Comment: I don't smoke, but the gov. telling me I can't is none of your concern. Let a business put a sign up that says we allow smoking and people will vote by going in that place or not. You idiots are going to ruin this country. Hope your dumb ass is gone soon!

Doctors prescribe narcotics for my pain and, I do not like to take narcotics because of the side effects. I use medicinal Cannabis to help with my pain, only side effects it increases my appetite. I have watched family members shrivel up and die painful deaths that could have benefited from Medical Cannabis. There are hundreds of thousand suffering people in this state that would benefit from the passing of this bill. I pray that you are in favor of this bill and look forward to hearing from you. Please reply to my letter and let me know where you stand. Thanks so much for your time on this matter.
Sincerely, Bryan Mann

Subject: [Office of Governor Bev Perdue] Happy New Year!


	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/library/images/newsletterHeader.jpg>


Happy New Year! 

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!

The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 

The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.

With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 

Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!

Following is the Constituent Services Submission just received:
Visitor: Mr. Todd Stevens

Address: 306 New Rail Dr, Cary, NC 27513

Email: todd7206@yahoo.com

Subject: cigarette ban

Comment: I would like to complain about the cigarette ban in bars/restaurants. I understand you want to protect children under 18, but why not allow smoking after 8 or 9pm? I believe the government has no right to ban a legal product from private or public use. If you want to control smoking, ban cigarettes altogether. North Carolina was built on tobacco and now our government is turning its back on the product that built this state. I am very disappointed that MY government stuck their nose in this issue. You should have offered good incentives for establishments to be smoke-free and not forcing small business owners to do something. To me this is just the beginning of a long list of personal freedoms that MY government will strip away from me. Please dont respond with "complaints of non-smokers drove this decision", there are plenty of smoke-free establishments for them to go to, at least they had a choice. Unfortunately, my choice/freedom was just ripped away from me. Can you please tell me why YOU stole this freedom from ME? This was not your place to decide what thousands of small business owners have to do.

Subject: Public Records DVD from NCCAT
Date: Fri, 1 Jan 2010 09:48:46 -0500

Mr Payne,
I didn't know who to contact but you are the Chair of the IT Advisory Board for the SCIO so I thought you could help me.
On 12-11-09, I picked up a dvd with email records for the top directors, finance dept employees, and IT staff of NCCAT in Cullowhee, NC.
This disc contains porn, dirty jokes, and questionable material for state employees to have on state email.
There are email communications between the HR director at NCCAT, Jan Rollinson, and David Smith, the IT Coordinator at NCCAT, with private email sent to the HR director that was forwarded to David Smith.

The request started when I was RIFed from NCCAT in april of last year and asked for my email archives. I didn't recieve them before I left so I put in a public record request for my emails that was ignored by Mary McDuffie for 2 months. Finally, I put in a request for all of their emails and mine to the Dept of Cultural Resources specifically Linda Carlisle. She put me in touch with Vanessa Jeter, Director of Technology for DPI, who helped to facilitate the records request.

NCCAT is a center attached to DPI with the passage of S202 last year.

After recieveing the disc, I found that it was put into an adobe acrobat format with no order to it at all. The emails are in 3 "binders" that are secure. I guess that means I cant reorganize them.

The first email that came up was a dirty joke to one of the finance persons at NCCAT. I looked a little more and found the pornography and stopped looking.

I contacted Linda Carlisle through email and a nice man named Joe Newberry called and left me a message that Linda Carlisle is not responsible for public records at NCCAT and basically don't call there anymore.
He contacted Vanessa Jeter who called me and reiterated, don't bother Linda, she is just the Secretary of Cultural Resources, she is not responsible for public records email content. It's funny, that is not how I read the state law about public records but I am a civilian.

Who may I send copies of this DVD to for review?

Thank you for your time,
Patricia Rayborn

I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR HOW YOUR STATE GARNISHES FUNDS WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION AND A CHANCE FOR THE TAXPAYER TO RECTIFY A TAX  PROBLEM. MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW WAS ADVISED OF THEIR PROBLEM WHILE SHOPPING FOR FOOD FOR THE FAMILY ON A FRIDAY IN DECEMBER. THE STATE HAD FROZEN THEIR ENTIRE DEPOSIT IN THE BANK OF AMERICA.MY SON WHO TRAVELS TO WORK DAILY WAS LUCKY, HE FILLED HIS CAR THURSDAY NIGHT. SHE HAD JUST BEEN LAID OFF FROM HER JOB THE MONDAY PRIOR TO THIS EVENT. THE STATE EMPLOYEES HAD NO APATHY FOR THEM AND TOLD HER IF SHE COULD NOT BE CALM SHE WOULD HANG UP ON HER. WE HAVE RAISE OUR CHILDREN TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND TO WORK HARD FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE GAINED IN LIFE AND I FIND THE ABOVE GARNISHING WAS NOT NECESSARY IF PROPER PROCEDURES WOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED. THE BANK OF AMERICA KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM BEFORE  THE TAXPAYERS. THIS SITUATION STINKS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS BAILING OUT FREELOADERS.  DO THE TAXPAYERS OF NC HAVE ANY RIGHTS?

Happy New Year! 

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!
The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 
The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.
With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 
Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!

>>> has Released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College . Released today, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship.
>>> This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking. Along with the evidence that he was first born in Kenya and there is no record of him ever applying for US citizenship, this is looking pretty grim. The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama's legitimacy and qualification to serve as President article titled, "Obama Eligibility Questioned," leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama's first official visit to the   U.K. In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups,

This lawsuit claims Obama's dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrio's case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president.

>>> Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.

>>> So how did a young man who arrived in New York in early June 1981, without the price of a hotel room in his pocket, suddenly come up with the price of a round-the-world trip just a month later?
>>>  
>>> And once he was on a plane, shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi , what passport was he offering when he passed through Customs and Immigration?

>>> Q: What passport did he travel under?

>>>  2) He traveled with a British passport, or

>>> If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims.

 [BAILOUT 51]  $ 14,400,000,000,000 and counting . . .
.
It wasn't going to be just a $700Billion Fix-it-all patch at the end of 2008 which Bush&Buckshot handed over to the Wall $treet Criminals who caused the Global Meltdown. 
.
Nope, that was just the trial run.  These Wall $treet MasterCons had much bigger plans in the works once they learned how to run their scams of US Taxpayers.
.
Now a year later, the total is up to $14.4 TRILLION, going to the same Wall $treet Criminals, plus still more to their Insurance buddies in the Healthcare Mafia.
.
Not one single Corporate Fascist who caused the Greatest Bank Heist in history has gone to jail, tho everyone knows who they are.
.
Question is:  why do YOU do business with any of these criminals?  For 2010, take your money out of Big Banks and move your accounts to member-owned Credit Unions, including your new, one (1) lower-cost credit card (that you will pay off each month).
.
To wrap up this Wall $treet RipOff, below is where your  $14.4 TRILLION has gone.
.
Who's going to pay for this?  Do you have to ask?

The Real Size of the Bail-Out
.
A guide to the abbreviations, acronyms, and obscure programs
that make up the $14.4 TRILLION federal Bailout of Wall $treet

(Mother Jones magazine, Dec. 21) -- The price tag for the Wall Street Bailout is often put at $700 billion -- the size of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). But TARP is just the best known program in an array of more than 30 overseen by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve that have paid out or put aside money to bail out financial firms and inject money into (free) markets. (Free is the operational word.) Below is a guide to many pieces of the puzzle:
.
Treasury Department bail-out programs

Money Market Mutual Fund: In September 2008, the Treasury announced that it would insure the holdings of publicly offered money market mutual funds. According to the "special inspector general" for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), these guarantees could have potentially cost the federal government more than $3 trillion.

Public-Private Investment Fund: This joint Treasury-Federal Reserve program bought toxic assets from banks and brokerages -- as much as $5 billion of assets per firm. According to the TARP special inspector general, the government's potential exposure from this fund is between $500 million and $1 trillion.

TARP: As part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Treasury has made loans to or investments more than 750 banks and financial institutions. $650 billion has been paid out (not including HAMP; see below). As of December 21, 2009, $117.5 billion of that has been re-paid.

Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) stock purchase: The Treasury has bought $200 million in preferred stock from Fannie Mae and another $200 million from Freddie Mac to show that they "will remain viable entities critical to the functioning of the housing and mortgage markets."

GSE mortgage-backed securities purchase: Under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the Treasury may buy mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to the TARP special inspector general, these purchases could cost as much as $314 billion.

Citigroup asset guarantee: In this joint Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC program, the government agreed to cover potential losses to a Citigroup asset pool worth $301 billion.

T-bill auctions to fund the Fed: In November 2008, the Treasury announced that it would borrow $260 billion to fund the Supplementary Financing Program, whose proceeds were deposited with the Federal Reserve.

TARP overpayment: This June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal government would lose $159 billion from its TARP loans and investments due to changes in their market value. (So far, Treasury has earned $14.4 billion in dividends from TARP.)

Bank of America asset guarantee: In this joint Treasury-Federal Reserve-FDIC program, the government agreed to cover potential losses to a Bank of America asset pool worth $118 billion. Bank of America has withdrawn from the program and has paid the government $425 million in compensation.

Potential international fund liabilities: In April, the United States committed up to $100 billion to fund the International Monetary Fund's lending and ensure that it "has adequate resources to play its central role in resolving and preventing the spread of international economic and financial crises."

The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) offers financial incentives to lenders to modify home loans. $75 billion in federal funds has been committed; $50 billion of that comes from TARP, and is set aside to modify mortgages not owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other government-sponsored entities.

Treasury exchange stabilization fund: A temporary program to insure the holdings of publicly offered money market mutual funds.

GSE credit facility program: Additional credit made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Expires December 31, 2009.


Federal Reserve bail-out programs

Commercial Paper Funding Facility: With the support from the Treasury, the Fed established the CPFF in October 2008 to increase the availability of short-term debt (commercial paper) funding. Up to $1.8 trillion was earmarked for the program.

Mortgage-backed securities purchase: In 2009, the Fed earmarked up to $1.25 trillion to buy investments based on home loans.

Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility: TALF provides financing to investors who are buying asset-backed securities. In February 2009, the Fed and Treasury announced an expansion of the program to generate up to $1 trillion in new lending.

Foreign Central Bank Currency Liquidity Swaps: The Fed has provided $755 billion for currency liquidity swaps with foreign central banks.

Money Market Investor Funding Facility: The MMIF was established in October 2008 to provide loans for investors buying certificates of deposit and commercial paper. According to the TARP special inspector general, $600 billion was allocated for the program.

Treasury Purchase Program: In March 2009, the Fed was authorized to purchase up to $300 billion of Treasury securities.

GSE Program: In March 2009, the Fed increased its purchases of debt from government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac) from $100 billion to $200 billion.

Primary Dealer Credit Facility: The PDCF provides overnight loans to primary dealers (financial firms that can engage in direct transactions with the federal government). The Fed allocated $147.7 billion for it in 2009.

The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) Liquidity Facility provides loans to financial institutions purchasing commercial paper from money market mutual funds. According to the TARP special inspector general, the Fed allocated $145.9 billion in 2009.

JPMorgan Chase/Lehman Brothers: In September 2008, the Fed gave JPMorgan Chase $148 billion in help the near-bankrupt Lehman Brothers.

Open Market Operations: In September 2008, the Fed injected $125 billion into the market by purchasing securities and re-purchase agreements (or repos), in which primary dealers borrow cash from the Fed.

Tri-Party Repurchase Agreements: The Fed provided $124.6 billion for this type of repo in 2009.

Primary Credit: The Fed provided $112 billion to offer loans at a discounted rate to eligible institutions in 2009.

Temporary Reserves: Between August and September 2007, the Fed made $93 billion of temporary reserves available for loans to financial firms.

Single-Tranche Repurchase Agreements: In 2009, the Fed offered a total of $80 billion for short-term loans to holders of mortgage-backed securities.

Term Auction Facility: Under TAF, the Fed auctions short-term loans to financial institutions. The amount of loans offered has varied widely; between December 2009 and January 2010, $75 billion in loans will be available.

AIG preferred stock interests, credit, and loan: The Fed provided $53 billion to the struggling AIG in various forms between 2008 and 2009.

AIG Securities Lending Facility: In October 2008, the Fed authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to borrow up to $37.8 billion in securities from AIG.

Maiden Lane II and III (AIG): In 2008, the Fed authorized its New York branch to form three limited liability companies: Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, and Maiden Lane III. It provided $52.5 billion to Maiden Lane II and III to assist AIG.

Maiden Lane I (Bear Stearns): The Fed provided $29.8 billion to Maiden Lane I to acquire Bear Stearns' assets and facilitate its merger with JPMorgan Chase.

TSLF: The Term Securities Lending Facility offers Treasury collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York so it can auction weekly loans to financial institutions. $25 billion in loans will be available between November 2009 and January 2010.

TOP: The TSLF Options Program allowed primary dealers to get TSLF loans in exchange for collateral. At the time of the program's termination in June 2009, $50 billion loans had been offered.

Expansion of system open market account securities lending: In July 2009, the Fed increased its limit for loans of securities to brokers from $3 billion to $5 billion, for a total of $36 billion in new lending.

JPMC/Bear Stearns Loan: The Fed provided a $12.9 billion bridge loan to JPMorgan Chase during its acquisition of Bear Stearns.

NOT INCLUDED:  More MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR costs:  for escalating the AfganWar;  for slowing catastrophic loses from Climate Change;  for slowing the murder and torture of Americans by the Healthcare Mafia;  for previous debt run up by Republican Presidents since Reagan;  AND for the day-to-day cost of running the Government, not including the INTEREST on all of this debt.
.
Welcome to the greatest Wall $treet Entitlement Program ever invented.

_____________________
.
Back when the World as we knew it was almost collapsed by greedy Wall $treet Bankers, when we were told this would cost us Taxpayers an unbelievable  $700,000 BILLION-- and might conceivably reach the then astronomical figure of ONE TRILLION DOLLARS -- I sat down to calculate how tall was a stack of a TRILLION One Dollar Bills.  You can read about it here:  <http://www.opednews.com/articles/How-can-you-visualize-a-tr-by-Gene-Messick-090103-512.html>How can you visualize a trillion dollars?
.
A stack of 1,000,000,000,000 greenbacks, in round numbers, is 63,000 miles high.
.
That was for TARP in 2008.  The 2009 stack of $14.4 TRILLION Dollar Bills would reach to the Moon almost 4 times, or there-and-back twice. 
.
That's just the Wall $treet RipOff for 2009, with no other outstanding bills included.
.
Here's the kicker:  This could be reduced significantly by a 50% tax on the net worth of the richest 10% of Americans, who lay claim to most of the wealth in America.
.
Click on <http://www.toomuchonline.org/inequality.html>Statistically Speaking from Too Much: An online weekly on excess and inequality.
.
They'd never miss it. And it's only fair:  the top 10% got what they have by stealing it from the rest of us ordinary folks.
.
"Take it back!" would be a great Resolution for the New Year!

Immigration law ignites fear in Arizona

 A new state law requires public workers to report illegal immigrants who apply for benefits they aren't entitled to. The attorney general will decide the law's scope.

 "It's about time people started being afraid," says state Sen. Russell Pearce.


 By Nicholas Riccardi

 January 1, 2010


 Reporting from Tucson - Cristina, an illegal immigrant living in South Tucson, recently went to a government office to sign up her children for a state-run Medicaid program.

 The boy and girl, ages 7 and 3, respectively, are U.S. citizens and entitled to the benefits. But Cristina, who spoke on condition her last name not be used, was fearful. She'd heard of a new state law requiring public workers to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement when illegal immigrants apply for benefits they are not legally entitled to.

 So when workers asked Cristina, 32, for identification, she fled. She now says she has no way to treat her daughter's liver problems or her son's asthma and impacted tooth.

 Cristina, a single mother and part-time house cleaner, is even reluctant to take her children to a hospital emergency room. "I feel so alone," she said.

 The new law has terrified the immigrant community here, leading to agonized discussions at schools, churches and community meetings about whether it is safe to get government help in Arizona. The author of the law, state Sen. Russell Pearce, is happy about that.

 "I have a hard time having compassion for criminals," Pearce said. "It's about time people started being afraid."

 Pearce contends that a large number of illegal immigrants improperly receive public benefits, and his law makes it a misdemeanor for a public worker to fail to report one. The law also allows citizens to sue public agencies if they believe immigrants are receiving improper benefits.

 "I want the law enforced," he said. "Every time you pass something it becomes a toothless tiger." He acknowledged that his bill is not supposed to apply to people like Cristina's children, who are legally entitled to federal benefits.

 The law took effect in late November, and it is not yet clear what government services it applies to. Some fear it could mean libraries and fire stations are obligated to report illegal immigrants, an interpretation Pearce said is silly.

 He said the bill applies only to a range of welfare, Medicaid and other government aid programs that are not already guaranteed to illegal immigrants under federal law.

 But many Arizonans are awaiting an opinion from the state's attorney general on the law's scope and which government workers are obligated to report illegal immigrants.

 Critics of the law say it creates fear and uncertainty over a problem that doesn't exist.

 "It's already the law in Arizona that we cannot give benefits to people who are in the country illegally," said Ken Strobeck, executive director of the Arizona League of Cities and Towns, which unsuccessfully sued to halt the law's implementation.

 Experts on both sides of the immigration debate agree that illegal immigrants rarely receive government benefits illegally. Many economists have found that immigrants pay for benefits they receive through taxes, though some studies show a net loss to government.

 The main cost to taxpayers comes from the use of public schools or emergency medical care -- benefits guaranteed illegal immigrants under federal law.

 Also, children of illegal immigrants who are U.S. citizens are eligible for the same benefits as those of any other citizen, such as food stamps.

 "There's not much that Arizona can do about it," said Steven A. Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, which favors restrictions on immigration. "The only solution is for us to have fewer illegals and fewer U.S.-born children" of illegal immigrants, he added.

 Camarota estimated that families headed by illegal immigrants receive public assistance at about the same rate as families of native-born citizens who lack a high school education. A 2002 study by the Urban Institute found that illegal-immigrant families used benefits at a far lower rate than native-born ones -- for example, 11% of illegal-immigrant families in Los Angeles County used food stamps, compared with 33% of low-income native-born ones.

 Randy Capps, who worked on the Urban Institute study and is now at the Migration Policy Institute, said illegal immigrants shy away from government aid. "When you're in an anti-immigrant, hostile environment, like in Arizona, the message is clear that you put yourself at risk with any contact with the government," Capps said.

 In 2004, Pearce, a Republican, helped write a ballot initiative that required state workers to report illegal immigrants who receive benefits. But Arizona Atty. Gen. Terry Goddard, a Democrat, interpreted the measure narrowly so the law applied to only a couple of obscure programs.

 This year, as the state struggled to address its budget deficit, Pearce inserted language in the budget bill reiterating those requirements. Many immigrant advocates and local officials were unaware of the move until the law took effect. Its impact was swift.

 Jennifer Allen, executive director of the Border Action Network here, said the group has been swamped with calls from terrified parents, like Cristina, fearful of seeking benefits for their U.S. citizen children.

 "It's sent a shock wave of fear through immigrant communities," Allen said.

 The state Department of Economic Services, which administers welfare benefits, has referred to federal authorities more than 750 people who applied for benefits without proof of legal residency. Officials at ICE have not said whether they have taken action on those cases, but stressed that their priorities in deportations lie with violent criminals.

 On a recent morning, a group of immigrants sat in the modest offices of the Border Action Network, sharing stories of fearful trips to apply for benefits. Sofia Machado, an English teacher and volunteer at the group, said one of her neighbors had been deported after seeking Medicaid for her U.S.-born children.

 Just as Machado finished telling the story, her cellphone rang. The caller's daughter was three months pregnant and had started bleeding, but the caller feared taking her to the hospital. Machado tried to reassure the caller that hospitals should not be checking immigration status.

 "There's a lack of information and a panicked ignorance," she said afterward. "Look at the disaster these people have created."

Happy New Year! 

Happy New Year, North Carolina!  I hope 2010 is a wonderful time for you and your family!

The year gone by was certainly tough for many. 

The economy squeezed budgets from the kitchen table to the halls of state government.  We all faced challenges - and there will be more to come - but as North Carolinians are so apt to do, we turned challenges into opportunities.

With the dawn of a New Year, we have time to pause, reflect and dream of what's to come.  Our New Year's resolutions can be bold.  We have a chance to turn things around. 

Dream big, because anything is possible in the New Year!
