Subject: taxes

Comment: Governor Perdue: I am a 44 Year old who currently lives in Gates, NC. My family is from Gates County and my husband and I moved to Gates almost three years ago. I am writing to you due to the tax assessment we received last week. The previous tax assessment was 94,851.00. The current assessment is 165,427.00. I don't understand with the current economy how this can happen. Everyday I hear how people owe more on their homes and property than what it is currently worth. So how can it be appraised at double. All of our neighbors have the same problem. Some have almost tripled! My husband is a truck driver. The reason we moved to Gates was because this was the only thing affordable for us. In December of 2007 my husband was injured on the job. He had to have surgery and was out of work until May of 2008. During the time he was out of work the company that he worked for lost the contract therefore putting him with no job to return to. He has been able to find another job but at a much lower salary than we were used to. At the end of 2008 we were facing foreclosure. I called my mortgage company on a regular basis and met with people from HUD for assistance. They told me not to worry that they would work something out. Needless to say nobody did anything to help us. Our only option at that time was to lose our home or file bankruptcy on a couple of loans that we had to try to hold onto our home. We struggle on a daily basis to pay our bills and feed our family. We have no health insurance or savings. When this tax increase causes our mortgage payment to go up, and it will, we will end up losing our home. I understand that the state of North Carolina is broke like every other state but it is a sad day when that state will cause people that work and pay taxes in that state to lose their homes just to make up the deficit. I would really appreciate an answer as to how this can happen. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Pam Kinard

Subject: Skilled Nursing Facilities

Comment: My sister is in a skilled nusing facility, and has been ther enow for about 10 months. She was there for Rehabilitation. My mother has been caring for her 16 year old son since she has been hosiptalized. The nursing home has taken her check starting this month and gives her 30.00 a month. This puts my mother who only gets 620.00 a month in disability. I contacted the nursing home and they said that they have nothing to do with how her son is taken care of. What other options do we have? I feel that the system is so unfair because we can care and aid for people who just want to have babies, but for the sick and elderly there are no optons and no assistance. When they are given assistance then they are required to jump through loop holes in order to get the assistance. The structure of this program is so unfair and is a failing system. Please advise me on what I can do in order to get her Social Security check back. Thank you in advance for your guidance. Michelle Carroll

Subject: Peer to peer lending

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, The current economic crisis places a huge burden on the average U.S. citizen, making it difficult for many to secure a loan. However, peer-to-peer lenders, like Prosper Loans Marketplace, can help provide the economic stimulus we need to drive America forward. Currently, Prosper is open to borrowers nationwide. But for the time being, only residents of California, and institutional investors whose primary place of business is in California, can invest in Prosper loans. Likewise, only California lending companies can list loans on the Prosper Open Market. I respectfully ask that you review and reconsider this decision, so that American investors nationwide can help their fellow citizens. As a country, we must move forward and embrace a brighter financial future. Thank you for your time and attention. Sincerely, Mark Shilling

Comment: Recently aired on WRAL TV was a story about a 16 year old teenager arrested by 10 FBI agents and two NC Highway Patrol officers. He has no rights as he was arrested under the Patriot Act. He has been taken to another state and imprisoned. Sounds like Gitmo. What are you willing to do to protect our constitutional rights here in NC?

Subject: NC Lottery

Comment: Governor Purdue, I have wrestled for weeks about sending this email to you recording the NC Lottery not working in NC and offerring a solution that I think would be more respected by true North Carolinians. After reading and article today in the Greensboro newspaper that 6 lottery workers have been lucky enough to win more than 4 times, I felt compelled to write you and suggest that North Carolina returns to it's roots of self support and not depend on a lottery, which at this point has to be questionable at best. I am a NC native, born and reared in Wayne County. I have traveled extensively to other states and have had opportunities to live other places. "I like calling NC home" is not just a slogan to me, but I must say it diminished when the lottery became law. We have always taken care of our own, even with some very poor race relations in some counties, we have still taken care of our own. I believe if you asked the working citizens of NC to begin giving $1.00 per month to assist with the budget, you would get an over whelmingly positive response. If you also told them that you were suspending the lottery and going to set up the funds collected such that contributors to this new fund could be rewarded by randomly selecting social security numbers to receive a refund (small percentage of the interest that is earned from what is collected), you would see North Carolians support a state owned process for getting the NC funds needed to support North Carolinians. The lottery is making money for the lottery works and not for all North Carolinians. It does not help to put a large some of money into the hands of one or two people occassionally. Something has to be done to bring NC back to it's roots of pride and dignity. I'm sure NC has some retired persons (project managers and systems developers who would voluntarily assist the state with making a plan of this nature work in their state. Sincerely, Geraldine F. Harper 336-697-7464

Subject: My daughter

Comment: May 5th, 2009 Governor Bev Perdue State of North Carolina Dear Governor Perdue: Back on January 27th, 2003 I became very ill and had to go to the hospital for treatment and left my only child for one of my siblings to take care of. I did not know that I was going to be admitted to the hospital for several days; nor did I know that my two siblings would not take care of my daughter. However, the state also messed up by holding on to my daughter and not releasing her back to me once I was released from the hospital. The person that was in charge of the case was Nina Wright. Once I was released from the hospital I was told by Nina Wright (Wake County Human Services) that they had custody of my daughter and I will not be able to see her or get her back, unless the court restored my custody rights. Based on North Carolina‚Äôs custody laws there must be some burden of proof that a child is in danger, abused or is afraid to live with the biological parent; I can be wrong about the laws. My daughter was not abused, in danger or was I a threat to her. The state should have given her back to me immediately once I left the hospital. I was told that she was in emergency foster care. The whereabouts of my daughter was always a secret to me and my family. I have no idea where she was or is today. Her due process rights were seriously violated. Nina Wright also did not allow any of my family members to get custody of my daughter; I have five sisters and three brothers who wanted to take my daughter plus my mother, they were each told that my daughter, Gabrielle, was not allowed to leave the state as well. Most of my siblings live outside of North Carolina. Nina Wright also held a meeting at my mother‚Äôs apartment; she lives in Raleigh, without my attorney and my knowledge. She iterated to my siblings who were at the meeting that neither of them were allowed to get custody of my daughter. They came from Brooklyn, New York and Manassas, Virginia. My mother was immediately ruled out because based on Nina Wright‚Äôs laws my mother was not fit to have custody of my daughter‚Ä¶the reason was based on my mother leaving us in Jamaica for a period of time while she worked and made preparations for us to come to the United States. My mother never abandon us; she left us with my aunt who took great care of us. Once my mother was able to work and save up enough money she sponsored the older kids so that they can help her by working. In 1979 the last bunch of us was able to come to the states. According to Nina Wright‚Äôs law my mother left us to suffer therefore she was wicked and did not deserve to get my daughter. My mother had a place for Gabby because she lives in a two bedroom apartment in Raleigh and still does today. Nina Wright was very rude and disrespectful to my mother as well; she is ignorant about immigration laws and the push pull factor. My daughter‚Äôs father did not want anything to do with her and gladly gave up his parental rights without a fuss. I was living in a shelter and was homeless at the time. The state of North Carolina took away all of my benefits including the most important thing of all my Medicaid that I needed to take care of my mental illness. You asked why my family did not take me in and helped me, the answer to that is they did not care about my welfare and that is the truth. I feel very a shame to tell you this but being homeless was the hardest life that I lived. Suffering from depression, without family and care is no joke. The shelters in Raleigh did not want me either. I hoped on a bus and ended up in Washington, DC where I again lived in a shelter for several months. All this time my daughter was in the custody of the state. Despite the fact that they did not want me living with them, not all of them, they all wanted my daughter. She‚Äôs the only child I have and I cannot have anymore, I had to have a full hysterectomy when I was 37. I had my daughter at age 33. Nina Wright also allowed me to see my daughter only two times since 1/27/03. The date was her 10th birthday, October 30th and one more time two weeks later. Then the visitation stopped. I have not seen my daughter since that day, she‚Äôs now 15. I cry everyday and not a day go by when I don‚Äôt miss her. I want her back. I‚Äôm now attending the University of Iowa, living in a two bedroom apartment and working. But Nina Wright gave my daughter up for adoption in less than a year after she entered the system. She never gave me a chance to get myself together, she took matters into her own hands and did not respect my attorneys or the court and made up lies about me without talking to me. I will admit I did miss court dates only because I had nowhere to live, was without a job and unable to provide for my daughter. However, to put her up for adoption in less than a year was just too soon; I have heard of cases where the court allowed the biological parent years to get themselves together and did allow them visitation rights or overnight stay, but I was denied all of the above. Now I do write to my daughter and have sent her clothes, laptop, IPod and lots of money to let her buy the things that she needs and the adoptive mother gives me permission to do so. In fact I write her just about every month. If I don‚Äôt hear from my daughter I call the case worker and beg her to make a call to the adoptive mother to ask her if she can let my daughter write me. I‚Äôve missed out on her Elementary school graduation, junior high school; she‚Äôs now in high school and her menstrual period. I was her only parent for nine years, no father around just me. She was born at seven months and yes I nursed her and took very good care of her. I can recall the only time that she was sick is when she had her tonsils remove that was age five. Can you please open up my case and assign someone to look into everything and do a full investigation and find out why my only child was rushed off to adoption so soon as well as why the state did not give me time to get myself together along with visitation rights? I currently live in Iowa City, Iowa and plan on returning to Raleigh next May 2010 for grad school. My goal is to become a juvenile delinquent case worker; due to everything that I‚Äôve been through which is hell and back I strongly believe that I can make a difference in a child‚Äôs life. I look forward to hearing from you and if I‚Äôve made you confused I apologize because I‚Äôm basing everything on what the state told me. Plus my daughter wants to come back home to me. I am able to care for her and have been for the past several years but no one ever gave me a chance. Please help me? If you can‚Äôt can you please pass this letter of dying request to the appropriate department. My daughter is half Jamaican and Puerto Rican and she is living with African Americans who do not know anything about her cultures if I had a say into the matter it would be for her to be place with a Jamaican or Puerto Rican family. My daughter in one of her many letters to me stated that she misses her Jamaican culture a lot and begged me to send her a Jamaican t-shirt, which I did; she also asked me to send her some Jamaican curry chicken. I can‚Äôt. So I cried. Sincerely, Jennifer Hernandez 622 Orchard Court-Apt.

Subject: bids for contractors to clean welcome centers & rest areas

Comment: I emailed Govenor Micheal Easley about this issue because contractors get workers with criminal records that commit crimes of theft and bring in other bad characters and in the process to welcome centers and rest areas to commit crimes that cost the state money other agencies money and also they destroy state property. The best solution for the State is to hire its own cleaning staff in welcome centers and rest areas like in South Carolina, Virgina, Florida. Florida also has security gaurds patroling their rest ares in which is needed here in this State. I voted Democrat straight ticket this time and reall y do support the party on domestic issues that are important to public well being and safety. I write poetry and design my own websites if you would like to see my writings go to www.royspoetry.000space.com I am in support of education in all counties and this is what will lift each community into better job growth toward the future. Etheir by making people indepent and working with each other. I have never beleived in high taxes and the reason why I look back when I lived in Boston, Mass and taxes were high it never worked then and it will never work now. Just plan on lowereing taxes because there is a market decrease and money you planned on collecting is not enough or not there at all in a bad economy.

Subject: Education Lottery

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I have read and seen on Television that the N.C.Education Lottery raised 1 billion dollars over a three period. I would like to know how this money is being used. This is a lot of money and our State is still in a financial crisis. Please explain.The purpose in the lottery was for education,but so far, I haven't heard of any of it being used for that. Thanks very much for your response. Sincerely, Patricia Brown

Subject: economy

Comment: The challenges of our economic storm are the biggest threat of our time. And like you I am very concern. I am concern about our children, grandchildren, and all future children. The debt we are facing. As tax payers and future taxpayers we‚Äôll never see the end of increased taxes, fail business, layoffs from jobs being sent to other countries. Illegal people in our country, using our benefits without contributing to them. Have you ever set in a social security office and see the people that are qualifying for benefits. As a senior citizen, with copd an other illness, I have work all my adult life and paid taxes, cannot qualify for benefits. They tell me I am qualified for the job, will I know I am qualified for a job, my health is not. The system was set up to take care of our citizens, sick, elderly, the ones that have work and contribute to the systems, however, we will give it all away to big companies, so that the rich can have a bonus. So these same bonus-grabbing persons can ask for more. Where do we stop and get back to what our country is well known For, taking care of the citizens of our great USA. When our elective officials worked for the people of this great country, and not big corporations. Are our elected officials paying back to the big corporations with stimulus packages for the help of getting elected? In the Winston-Salem Journal I read the Social Security precipitants are not to receive a cost of living increase for the next two years, now, I ask you is this the same for the elected officials in Washington. Will they turn down an increase? When some of us elderly this is the only income we have, however, the cost of living is still going up, gas (again), food, and interest on credit card, mortgages. Retirement benefits are unstable, senior citizens having to go back into the job market just to buy the necessities, instead of enjoying there senior years.

Subject: Retired Teachers

Comment: I am a retired teacher who is still teaching. I love it! I teach in a high minority school which needs experienced teachers. I would like you to consider giving retired teachers beginning teacher pay instead of sending us home. Retired teachers have a lot to offer. This is only my 1st year to double dip. If a teacher is truly dedicated to teaching they will teach for a beginning salary rather than their full salary. It is the same difference if you were to hire a new teacher. I ask you to consider this option before denying us the privilege of working. Sincerely, Debbie Waters Rutherford County Resident Cleveland County Employee

Subject: US Army "Cold War" Commemorative Stone Dedication invention

Comment: Re: US Army "Cold War" Dedication First allow me to introduce myself, my name is Gaither Deitz. I served with the 3rd Sq. 14th Armored Cav in Bad Hersfeld, Germany from 1966-1968 age of 17-20. I am sending this email as an invention for a Unites States Government Official to attend our dedication in Bad Hersfeld Germany. Two committees representing former 3d Squadron troopers of the 14th and 11th ACR have plans for a dedication of a Commemorative Stone that will honor the 3rd Squadron Soldiers for their service during the ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù Some Germany Government Official will be present 25 June for the dedication. In 2005 I like many other former GI‚Äôs returned to Bad Hersfeld on holiday with my family to visit where I served in the Army. I was saddened, disappointed there was nothing there acknowledging our past presents. At this time I came up with the idea and started working on having a monument erect in Bad Hersfeld to Honor all who severed with the 3rd Squadron. The installation of a memorial would not only honor those who served there. It would also be there to educate others of the Kaserne‚Äôs history. A reminder the U.S. Army was in Bad Hersfeld during the Cold war. With the help of Mrs. Renate Stieber and Thomas Schossow of Germany, we have received approval from the Bad Hersfeld Government to place a Commemorative Stone at our former Kaserne. The plaque will be mounted on a stone, set on the former grounds where the flag pole once stood in front of our former Headquarters‚Äô building.

The day was wet and cold, as it always seemed and there were 2 bus loads of Germans making their way around the OP/museum. I cannot tell you the pride that I felt watching them study us ‚Äì the Blackhorse Troopers and those of the 14th ACR who went before and their absolute recognition as to what had been sacrificed and accomplished on their behalf and on behalf of freedom for all of us! I listened in my survival German to the Guide who explained what might have been and how the soldiers of the Regiment stood vigilant all those many years to insure that what might have been - never was. He spotted me listening to him and asked if I had served in Fulda and I have to confess that my response was preceded by tears in my eyes and swelling in my chest when I told him that I did serve in Fulda from 1973 - 1976 and I was proud to have served him, Germany, the United States of America and most of all to be able to say I was a Blackhorse Trooper and Member of the Boarder Legion and the United States Army.

LTC USA (RET) ++++++++++++ 3rd Sq 14th & 11th Armored Cav "The mission of the 14th and 11th ACR was to verify an attack of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviets. War Games were played by both sides on the border. We did recon on the border so we could alert the 7th Army of an advance across the border. That's why we were a Recon Sqdn. Our second mission was to delay the aggressors as long as possible. Life expectancy was 20 minutes. All larger units were located farther into Germany; this would give them time to mobilize and to get NATO units on the move. They also had to relocate dependants. Why would we have had a NA 14 (Nuclear Warheads) if not to slow down the progress of the aggressor. To the men who served here in the 14th ACR Regiment during the Cold War. Part of them will always remain in this place. Their dedication to duty served as a testament to the world that freedom is precious. A unified Germany has resulted from the efforts and personal sacrifices made by the soldiers stationed here in Bad Hersfeld. May history never forget all those who served here with the 3Rd Sq. US Army Special Forces, MSG. Ret. History: In 1972 the colors of the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment were retired and the troopers found themselves as members of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. From there, a new generation of soldiers accepted the challenge and carried on the distinguished traditions of the first guardians on the Frontier of Freedom. The 11th Cav was present until 1989. In 1989 the McPheeters Kaserne was turned over to the people of Germany.

Subject: pay cuts for state employees

Comment: I understand that Governor Perdue is cutting salaries for state employees. First of all I am not a state employee however I do know that a lot of state employees have to drive a long distance to get to work and I'm sure that the gas price increase the governor's office is aware of. It has gotten to the point that people are having to worry about getting food or gas to drive to work. I just want to know if the governor is also cutting her salary. I feel like every person that holds a "high office" should and want to set an example for the public to be aware of. It just seems like the poor get poorer and the middle class is still just "hanging out there". Families are already stretched to the limit and then to have to have a pay cut probably seems like to them "who care"?

Subject: State Employee Pay Cuts

Comment: With the recent pay cut for state employees I wanted to know if Bev Perdue and all high level governmental officers are getting the same pay cut and at the same rate. People at her level are making significantly more than people like teachers so it would have a bigger impact if they took a pay cut also. To be clear I am not a state employee so I was not affected by this. However, as a tax payer and voter the only way I would support this is if it across the board and at a equal rate, which includes high level positions (governor included). Thank you, Paul Sanders

Subject: Elder Abuse in Adult Care Homes

Comment: I have two daughters who were recently terminated from their positions as CNA's at a local Retirement Center. My one daughter was let go because she's 8 months pregnant and submitted a dr's. note stating she could only work 8 hour shifts instead of the 12 hour shifts she'd been working. They informed her she could not come back until she had a dr's. note stating she could work 12 hours. My other daughter was terminated after the owner of the facility told the maintenance man to "get her daughter, tell her to clock out and get the hell off his property". I have heard horror stories about this facility from both my daughters and have seen firsthand how rude these owners are. My pregnant daughter called me to pick her up as they were sending her home because of the dr's. note. While I was there, I had a conversation with the owners, which resulted in a confrontation and the owner telling me to "get the hell off his property and he was calling the police". That's when I asked to talk to my other daughter, at which time he told the maintenance man to get my daughter, tell her to clock out and get the hell off his property. There are only a few actual licensed CNA's that are working there. There are some that are performing CNA duties and have been for 3-5 years without any licensing. There have been several instances where narcotics have 'come up missing' but was never reported. There have been 'accidents' involving residents that were not reported. There have been injuries that have not been reported or were not reported in a timely manner. I have filed a complaint with our local DHS office, but something REALLY needs to be done about investigating adult care facilities. Our elders brought us into this world and we owe it to them to help them out of this world with dignity! PLEASE help me. I am disabled but am willing to help in whatever way possible, but I am only one person. We need to do something about this situation.

Comment: I'm emailing to find out when and what is going to put into place for state workers to help with weight loss. I figured that I need to lose about 60 lbs within the next 3 years to remain on the 80/20 health plan. I would like to get started but I need to know what initiatives are being put in place and what is available to me as a state employee to help with losing the weight. At first I was not pleased with the idea of being forced to lose weight because other than overweight I have no other health issues but if the governor is going to have programs or assistance to help us then I want to go ahead and take part in it. Please let us know ASAP what we can get involved in to get started on losing this weight. Thanks, Jennifer Cooke

Subject: State Employees' Pay

Comment: Governor Purdue, I am not at all happy that my salary for the work I do as a teacher in a North Carolina Public School is going to be cut, especially since my family and I have been living paycheck to paycheck since my husband was laid off from his welding job in June 2008. However, I do understand the necessity of the decision. I won't argue that it was wrong, because I have no alternate suggestions for solutions. However, I am very upset that the entire amount is coming out of one check. Do you understand what that is going to do to those of us who barely make ends meet as it is? One month with a $200-$300 chunk taken out of our check will impact much more than that month. There is very little surplus left from our checks as they are now, and a shortfall of this amount is going to really hurt. There must be a better way.

Subject: GI Bill

Comment: Governor, I am writing to you in response to the action that VA recently took on my GI Bill. I served this country diligently in Iraq. I never questioned my orders, and I fought to protect our freedom and safety after 9/11. Upon my discharge from the US Army I decided to go to school and get my degree. Not only did I not qualify for as much federal aid (because the GI Bill-which I paid into counted against me), but I now was just informed of an error in payment. It seems a class which VA authorized LAST semester no longer counts toward my degree. Without my knowledge and without warning, VA decided to keep this months payment to retrograde the money they paid out for this class, the one they AUTHORIZED last semester. That money is used to feed my family and pay my rent. I know times are tough for everyone now. I have been out of work since September and we just added baby number 5. However, I earned this money and now I am being told nothing can be done. I fought for this country and believe in what it stands for. I refuse to believe nothing can be done. Can you please assist with this matter? Sincerly and with due regard, Caleb Troy Clayton

Subject: V.A. Benefits

Comment: Mrs. Perdue, I am very aware that a staff member is the one to recieve this email. However, I do sincerely hope that you will pass this along so that Mrs. Perdue may read it herself. My name is Jessica Hunter. I am 23 years old and living on my own. I work full time, am not able to afford healthcare coverage and so therefore do not have any, I make too much money to be eligable for medicaid and am not able to financially afford collage without assistance. I just recieved a letter today stating that I was denied the V.A. Scholorship. I worked extremely hard for that and am astounded that I am not eligable. What disappoints me more than anything is if I had a child, I would be more eligable to recieve financial assistance for college. What are you saying to us middle class men and women who CHOOSE not to have children in hopes that we can better ourself before bringing another child into this world that lives off of welfare and foodstamps? I personally voted for you in hopes that you would in fact change these very things. I cannot recieve a Pell Grant, again, because I make too much money. If I had a child I would more likey get one. I have bills to pay too just like you do. And it enrages me that people who DO NOT WORK, LIVE ON FOODSTAMPS, GOVERNMENT MONEY && MY TAX MONEY can recieve benfits that I too deserve! I hope you seriously take into consideration what I have said & the fact the I (as well as many other adults in my position) feel as though people in control of granting help to those who really work hard, strive and deserve it are doing a TERRIBLY POOR JOB! Thank you for your time and my well articulated denial letter. This only makes me want to speak up more for matters like these, as well as prove that I will somehow do this (obviously) without the help I am entitiled to since your perogative is obviously focused on continuing to handfeed those that chose to cheat the system. Have a great day. Jessica Hunter

Subject: Better leadership

Comment: You should cut your own salary a half percent as well as every other state employee and state government representative who is paid. Why don't you do that? You only became governor bec. of riding Obama's coattails. We needed new Republican leadership after enduring sleazy Easley for 8 years. Too bad North Carolinians did not elect a Republican for governor. You Democrats are good at taxing and bad at money managing.

Comment: I emailed you two days ago and have not heard a response to my question so I will ask it again. Please explain why some of the lowest paid workers (state employees and teachers) are receive a salary reduction when money is given for elected officials salary increase, travel, food, conferences, etc. Also, our poor teachers are working so hard to help the students pass the EOG's and you dock their pay these last two months--bad timing don't you think?

This is money I need for my child's education and I'm not nearly as concerned with your lack of budgetary planning as I am with the location of my money. I'm calling the "loan" due.

Subject: raises and incentives for teachers/principals

Comment: I am on the board of a public charter school and currently working on the budget for next year. It is my understanding that we cannot use state funds to give raises or incentives/bonuses for teachers and the principal. Is this correct? Our Director of Operations states we can because as a Charter School, we don't have to follow the same guidelines as the public school systems and can do what we want to with the money. Please advise. Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: Medicaid

Comment: Good morning Governor Perdue, I was laid off of work on March 27, 2009. I knew I would be because my position was a seasonal job. I went to DSS on March 31, 2009 to apply for food stamps and Medicaid. I‚Äôm a single mother of 2, that pays rent of $783 a month, has a car note, & other bills. My only income right now is unemployment of $260 a week, I don‚Äôt receive child support but suppose to from my daughters father in NY but he‚Äôs over $8k in arrears. It‚Äôs a court ordered case for him & he‚Äôs a Suffolk County police officer in NY, NC is taking so long for me to get the child support from him this process has been over 11 months now. My issue I‚Äôm writing about is the Medicaid; I applied on 3/31/09 and received a letter from DSS on 5/2/09 saying I was approved from 3/01/09 through 3/31/09. What bothers me is I went to them on 3/31/09 and just now received a letter in May that I was approved when in March I applied. I need medical assistance & I need to see a dentist really bad. If I‚Äôm only approved for a month I‚Äôm fine with that but I think it‚Äôs only fair they allow me to see a doctor being that I didn‚Äôt get the letter until May, and it was mailed on April 29, 2009. I spoke with a Ms. Lee and she said it was because I started receiving unemployment in April. Am I not suppose to receive any money to live off of? How can the government deny a single mother of help with no job? My son receives Medicaid and I have a friend that worked the same job with me, same pay and she receives Medicaid and lives home with her parents how is that? I need your help in this matter please as well as why is it taking NC so long on getting my child support when it is court ordered her father is law enforcement he should be in jail right now for being in arrears. I can be reached at 704-771-1470 Thank you, Felicia Saddler

Comment: Im not sure if you are the person I need to be talkig to or not, but my mother Patricia McLean is in the womens prison in Raliegh she is very sick and has been there for nearly two years for probation violation which was not an act of a serious crime. My mother has heart problems an is not sure how much longer she can make it she has had numerous strokes while in there and I am very worried about her health they say she needs surgery and may not make it out. They keep changeing her release date from December of this year until February or March of next she has missed the birth of her first grandchild could you please do something to help her get out earlier. She is all me and my sister have and we dont want something to happen to her in there an us an her grandson not be able to spend her last days with her.
