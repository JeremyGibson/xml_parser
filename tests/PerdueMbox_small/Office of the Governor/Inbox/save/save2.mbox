Subject: NC State Patrol using a $75,000.00 corvette!

Comment: For the first time today, I saw a New $75,000.00 Corvette being used as a State Highway Patrol car and realized what a poor job our state is doing in some of the hardest times it has faced in my 44 years. You have got to be kidding!!!! I understand it was a drug seized car, which didn't cost the state a dime (right...), however, that just means if the car was auctioned off, there would be a larger profit margin to help get the state out of the financial shape it is in. I'm not say it would solve the budget crisis, but its a start. Who knows how many other exspensive "toys" the state has that we don't need. There is nothing wrong with using a Ford Crown Victoria for a patrol car. Not to mention its $50,000.00 less. Seeing this corvette parading up and down Interstate 40 does NOTHING to help everyones view point of how this state and our Governor is doing "all it can" to handle our financial crisis. When something is placed in your hands for free, make a good decisions on how to benefit best from it. Patrol cars have radios now. No one, including the highway patrol, needs a car that can go 198 mph on Interstate 40 or any other highway. That is foolish. Please explain to me how using this car makes GOOD sense. I will hopefully hear from you by email or standard USPS mail.

Mr. Russell Pignatore,



Your e-mail to the Governor’s Office has been forwarded to me for response.



Who to Call
Questions concerning a traffic ticket issued by a N.C. State Trooper or other law enforcement officer should be directed to the <http://www.ncdistrictattorney.org/>District Attorney for the county in which the ticket was issued.

The telephone number for the District Attorney can be located in the State Government section of the local telephone directory.  To find a district attorney, <http://www.ncdistrictattorney.org/>click here.

Questions about the court date or location should be directed to the Clerk of Superior Court of the county in which the ticket was issued.  <http://www.nccourts.org/JDirectory/JDSearch.asp>Click here to access the court system's judicial directory.

The telephone number for the county clerk of court is listed in the State Government section of the local telephone directory under judicial or courts. 

Court Costs
Court costs are $120 for District Court.

Payment of fines and costs are NOT made to the officer but to the clerk of Superior Court. The clerk DOES NOT accept personal checks, only money orders or bank checks. The clerk will accept cash only when paying in person.

The Conference of Chief District Court Judges, not the officer, establishes a list of charges which may be paid without a mandatory court appearance and those which require a court appearance.

<http://www.nccourts.org/Forms/Documents/912.pdf>List of Traffic Offenses Requiring Mandatory Court Appearances

The fine entered by the officer on the back of the ticket is set by the Conference of Chief District Court Judges and not by the officer.

Failure to Appear
The Division of Motor Vehicles will revoke a person's drivers license or the right to drive on an out-of-state license if the person fails to appear in court or fails to pay the fine and costs. The revocation will remain in effect until the ticket is paid and the person goes to court.

Advertising
Some lawyers may send a letter to a person receiving a ticket. The lawyers obtain the names and addresses from the Clerk of Superior Court. The officer issuing the ticket has no control over the advertising. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that lawyers have a constitutional right to advertise.

Subject: speed limit sign not where it should be

Comment: Dear Governor I was travelling from my home in Manassas Va. to Kernersville N.C. As I entered the vicinity of Henderson N.C. I was pulled over by TRP D R Eanes.Jr.who informed me that I was in violation of speeding. I told him that i wasn't due to the fact that I just passed a limit sign of 70mph.HE informed me that I was going 79 in a 65. And that he was aware of the 70mph sign that I had passed but that the N.C. speed limit is 65mph. I explained that im from Va. and was not aware but once again The sign said 70.After he issued me the citation when I proceeded in about 2 minutes I came upon a 65mph limit sign. At that moment I became upset because the tactic TRP Eanes is using is unjust.He is stopping drivers inbetween the state line where the 70mph limit sign is and before they reach the 65mph sign.I have an excellent driving record and always am aware of my speed. and i don't appreciate this unjust tactic being used by TRP Eanes.I strongly beleive I am not quilty and would like for your office to look into this matter of where these speed limit signs are and have them correctedand also have this citation dismissed.

Subject: Pace Airlines





I am writing in reference to Pace Airlines, based in Winston Salem, and it's owner, William C Rodgers of Liberty, Mo. Mr. Rodgers is currently under investigation by the NC Department of Labor for not paying his employee for 4 or more weeks. The DOL attorneys are deciding if they will take any action. He is also under investigation by the NC Insurance Commission for canceling employee medical insurance and not giving employees the required 45 day notice. He has been arrested by the insurance commission and is scheduled for trial Oct. 16. 



There are several other issues that need to be addressed, and no one knows if anything is being done or not. First, there is concern for all of the employee’s personal information that is on the company computer. We are all concerned about who may have access to this. Mr. Rodgers has shown that he has no respect for his employees' welfare and a total disrespect for the law.



When we were getting paid, dental insurance, life insurance, and disability insurance premiums were taken out of our checks, but the insurance companies were not paid. Also our Wage Works flex spending account was canceled at the time we were laid off. After that date we did not have access to the money. We were not given any warning at all that this was going to happen.



This constitutes fraud, and possibly other laws. The actions of this man have destroyed the lives of many of his employees, and have disrupted the lives the other employees.



Many more facts concerning this matter can be found on the websites of WXII, WGHP, and the Winston Salem Journal.



Thank you for any assistance you can give to me and my fellow ex-employees of Pace Airlines.

Subject: nc contractors



Hello Mrs.Perdue, I have been meaning to write to you for some time, but i have been busy trying to keep work going for my employees and my self. I have been in business in NC for 23 years and have enjoyed being a part of NC business owners. I could go down the list of things that I have supported over the years, like kids on drugs programs and many others, but I will get to the point of this inquiry. I recently discovered that in January of 08 that the NC general contractors agency up dated the contractors limits of work. They took the first level contractor from 250,000. to 500,00. the intermediate level from 500,000. to 1,000,000. and then there is unlimited. The sub-contractor level was at 30,000.00 and did not change. I would have thought that it would have been moved to 60,000. being that all the other levels did in-fact double. I currently am classified as a sub- contractor and have been so for 23 years. Now, I guess that you are wondering why I just don't get my contractors license. I have considered this move, but I would be required to maintain workers comp at all times, and with the slump in the economy, as I am, I can cut my  work force and drop workers comp and stay in business. If I had to maintain the insurance, I would have folded my current business of 15 years. Currently this insurance was costing me 30,000.00 per year with a full crew, and excluding myself under the policy. By the NC contractors assy, I would be required to maintain this insurance. I feel that the flexibility in this matter is more important than a title. I am a small company but do pay all my taxes and employee people in NC so that they can pay there part as well. I would guess that the biggest part of a states business owners, are sub-contractors. Mrs. Perdue, thank you for taking the time to read this letter. If you can help or have information to who I might contact to try and get these limits changed, I will follow it up.  Thanks Again.

Address: 1101 Edinburgh Ct, Jamestown, NC 27282

Email: denise_e_smith@hotmail.com

Subject: Cell Phones and Amber Alerts

Comment: Why, with all of the studies out there saying that using a cell phone while driving is dangerous, does the state choose to encourage their use on the highway anyway? All of the electronic signs along I-85 and I-40 were alerting drivers this morning that there was an Amber Alert. Instead of providing drivers with the color, make, and model of the vehicle along with its license plate number (which would have fit on the three line signs), they tell drivers to call 511 for more information! Not only would more people immediately have the information to help find the suspect vehicle, fewer people would be using cell phones on busy roads. The stretch of I-40 between the I-85 junction and the Route 29 exit in Greensboro is bad enough in the morning: putting more drivers on cell phones is crazy and irresponsible of the state. Other states use their electronic signs this way, perhaps North Carolina should, too. Can't the procedures be changed to eliminate this hazard? Respectfully, Denise Smith

Comment: I am tired of fighting to keep my head above water just to have my town turn it off. I have struggling for so long know that utility bill is too high and I don't have the funds to make it current. I have called every place the State, United Way, and my works EAP has told me to call for assistance with this bill so my water and electricity doesn't get turn off. Every where I have turned for help I have been basically told "Too Bad...So Sad" but we don't have funds to help you. Other places I have called either don't return the call or don't answer their phone. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND I DON'T WANTED PLAY ANYMORE....I GIVE UP!!! I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT TO FIGHTING ANYMORE!!!

We have a problem in our Community with unsafe roads and we need help.  When School Buses come into our neighborhood it should be passable and safe and we should not have to spend out of our pockets to make sure that is done. 



Millions are have been and still are spent on Beach Renourishment.  We put the sand there and it washes out into the inlet for more money to be spent to pump it out of the inlets.  It is time  for help for others, after all it is our tax payers money being  spent and we need some  of it  too.


Now, I am okay with helping with tourism,  but not to this degree that we spend the tax payers dollars and don't get anything else done. We need more.



I would like for you to get us some help out here and get these roads paved.  If all the utility companies and county vehicles and everyone is going to use these roads then we need help.  My husband has spent $3,000.00 of his own hard earned money and his labor to keep our road going and it is not paved.  We are getting to old  to do the work and we cannot afford to hire it done.  It is time  for help Governor and we desperately need help.  Can you get us some help,  please.



Thank you for your time and consideration in this.

Email: tntcostner@yahoo.com

Subject: McFalls House GRS Services Gastonia, NC

Comment: My brother, Clinton McManus, 39 years old and Eric Falls respectively live together in a house in a neighorhood in Gastonia, NC. I would like to tell you about my brother and his roommate. they were born with complex neurologic challenges and autism. Because of these challenges they are known in our service delivery system. They spent part of their lives in a state instition and moved to Gaston County on 1984. We were joyful to have them so close to us. During thier lives they have been unhappy, neglected, abused and drugged by their professionals and caregivers for the sake of "behavior modification." They lived in five and six person "group homes" and of course they became over stimulated and challenges occurred. Do you know how it feels to get a call saying that your brother has been hurt and the staff has no idea how it happened? Or that he has bitten another client because he was over stimulated? So, then you have to find a new home that hopefully not be as bad as the last one. In 2003 they moved to a small house. They developed a life. They are content. Gaston Residential Services has provided the care, and support that they need. Two years ago they began part time work delivering medical supplies and picking up paper recycling. THEY PAY TAX!!! We are so pleased with the life we wish they always had. Weeks go by without any challenges that are related to an illness. They receive fine mediacl and dental attention from the same doctors that you and I visit. The staff, who are well learned and gentle teachers, like Clint and Eric and we know that Clint and Eric like them. They are safe here. Please don't take this life away from them or our families. CAP/MR is a Medicaid program. Both Clint and Eric receive these funds. IPRS is state funds. Both Clint and Eric receive these fund. Cap/MR funds annually: $137,918.29 IPRS funds annually: $70,842.13 The supporting documents mandate that if a person receives CAP/MR/Medicaid funds and they receive Social Security, they are not eligible to receive the IPRS state funds. We recognize the serious losses the state has suffered and we recognize the operating this 24 hour 365 days per year home is more expensive than some models. But it works and it is providing humane treatment. These funds have been approved with incredible justification for 6 years by Pathways LME, the Cap/MR section, and Value-Options. GRS sent in a request for an exeception to this state mandate to Pathways LME. Because of the deep state budget cuts Pathways is unable to grant exceptions, except those mandates by the state for these men rather than the Thomas S people.We respectfully request that you: PLEASE FIND THE IPRS/STATE DOLLARS TO FUND PATHWAYS IN ORDER THAT MY BROTHER MAY CONTINUE TO LEAD SAFE AND SATISFIED LIFE NEAR ME AND MY PARENTS IN THE CITY WHERE THEY WERE BORN!!!!!! I can't stand to see my family worry, crying and feeling helpless. I would also like to mention that I have worked in the mental health field because I wanted to make a differance in the community, like GRS has done for me and my family. I recently decided that I would no longer be able to work in this feild anymore. I wanted to work and help people with MR/MH/DD. I could not understand why Drug addicts could receive a check, blow it on drugs and then expect me and the service I worked for to take them to food banks to get food, because they had no money! MY BROTHER DID NOT GET OUT OF BED ONE MORNING AND MAKE THE DECISION THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE AUTISTIC. YET, THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE DECISION TO GO AND BUY CRACK OR WHATEVER THE CHOICE OF DRUG IS, MADE THAT CHOICE. CLINT AND ERIC DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE!!! So, that is why I can't understand why the state can't find the money to help them. Give the money to them and not the drug addicts. Please once again, I am pleading with you not to let this happen to Clint and Eric, and their families. If you have any questions please call me or write. Mobile: 704-268-4057 or tntcostner@yahoo.com You may also contact Rita Thuot at Gaston Residential Services, Inc. 704-861-9280. The mailing address is 905-A North New Hope Road Gastonia, NC 28054.

                        Congratulations on your your son's marriage last weekend.  That is truly an exciting time.  Many people have said to me that the extra ferry ran to Ocracoke to accomodate wedding guests.  They said that NC citizens will foot that bill.  I told them I did not want to hear gossip, but would contact you and ask if the ferry was funded by your family or the state.  It is important for NC citizens to know where their money is going.  I think a lot of people are gunshy after the last governor.  I will await your reply and not speak of this issue until I hear from you.  Thank you.

Dear Gov. Perdue,



     I am sending you a copy of a proposal I am sending my mortgage company.  To give you some background my younger brother got this loan in the year 2000.  He was young and believed all that was told to him.  A few years later he was unable to handle this debt with the high interest rate.  He was originally told he could refinance in a year but was turned down when the time came.  So I basically took over this debt.  We had the loan transferred to my name but they still did not refinance.  Throughout the years I have been unable to get them to refinance.  I have been leasing the mobile home but the tenants are now leaving and with the jobs market being  so insecure I don’t feel I will be able to handle this debt that has not decreased much at all with the high interest rate it has.  I have read that President Obama has stimulus programs to help the loan companies.  Please read my letter below and if you can offer any assistance on this I would greatly appreciate this.

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….





To Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc.:



     The mobile home I am buying was originally from Oakwood Mobile Homes and the loan was taken over by your company shortly after.  It is a 1999 model which was purchased in 2000.  The original cost was $37,673.00.  The balance is about $31,037.95.  This was sold at 12% interest but was told that it could be refinanced in one year to lower the interest rate.  Throughout the years it has been asked to refinance this home but has been refused.  If you look at the interest that is being paid as of now minus what has been paid on the principal, the mobile home is practically paid for.  At the present interest rate the mobile home will probably never be fully paid for.  I do not reside at the mobile home anymore.  I was leasing it and the tenants are moving out which leaves me unable to pay for this because of uncertainties in both me and my wife’s job.  With our economy in such despair and being President Obama has stimulus plans to assist the loan companies in finances, we as a country need to work together.  Foreclosures are not good for the economy, customers, or companies.  To benefit both of us I would like to suggest a compromise.  I would like to offer $20,000.00 to pay this loan off.  You would still have made a substantial profit on this mobile home that you definitely would not be able to recover if this was foreclosed.  Please consider this offer and let me know what you decide.



Loan # 451343

Subject: Complaint regarding State Employee



Gov Perdue,

I dislike going this route since I can normally get along with anyone. 

I am a volunteer for the state of NC and have been for some 7 years or so.  I participate in a program run by the prison system which allows a community volunteer to take out an inmate who is near release into the community to begin to acclimate him to the idea of being out on his own.  I think this program is good in that it should be one of the many things we do to discourage recidivism.

I am an approved community volunteer (CV) at both Durham Correctional and Orange Correctional. 

One of the men I'd taken out in Durham was transferred to Wake back in May of this year.   I really liked Willie Terry.  He had work release job at Honey's in Durham.  He was one of 3 inmates who worked there.  One of the inmates assaulted a waitress there and, in order to properly investigate the incident, all three were removed from employment.  Willie was transferred to Wake although he was found innocent of any wrongdoing.

He was getting very little assistance in finding a job after the move to Wake.  He recently told me that he had not been allowed to make any calls looking for work for the last three weeks while other inmates were offered a weekly chance to make calls to potential employers.  I don't understand why this is, but I do know that Willie is highly motivated and very interested in getting a job, no matter how menial it might be.

Anyway, I understand that Wake allows CV sponsors such as I to take inmates out to job interview and to pick up applications at potential places of employment.  I wanted to assist Willie in that way until he was employed again even though I live in Durham and he is incarcerated in Raleigh.

Back in May, I sent in paperwork to be a sponsor at Wake Correctional and was told by programs director Theodore Walker that I'd have to wait to take the class being offered in August and get the training done by Wake, even though I am a qualified CV sponsor in both Durham and in Orange.  This made no sense to me, but I had no choice.  I took the class in Raleigh, then I had to go back to the prison on 4 separate weeks to attend a weekly religious service in order to meet up with an inmate I could potentially sponsor, even though I specified that I wanted to sponsor Willie Terry and already knew him.

Now, here is where it gets strange.   I completed my training and my 4 weeks of religious services (I don't know if there is a separation of church/state issue here) and expected to get my CV card which would allow me to take Willie out to job interviews.  When it didn't come, I sent an email to the director, Theodore Walker, who responded saying that Willie Terry already had a sponsor.  I took a call from Willie later that week and he told me that he had talked to Mr Walker back in August and Mr Walker asked if Willie wanted a sponsor.  Willie told him that he wanted me to sponsor him, but that, until I could get qualified, he would like to go to church with someone.  Mr Walker told him that switching sponsors would be no problem.  As it turns out, a sponsor took Willie to church for the very first time the week that I finished my long list of requirements to be a sponsor. 

Willie tried to talk to Mr Walker about switching sponsors after I'd been told by Mr Walker via email that I needed to pick another inmate to sponsor.  (For some reason, Wake allows an inmate to only have one sponsor while Orange and Durham allow an inmate to be sponsored by any qualified individual).  Mr Walker never answered any of Willie's notes and, when Willie contacted him as he crossed the yard, he tells me that Mr Walker spoke to him as if "he were trash", even yelling at him.  He told Willie that he would have to call his former sponsor himself and tell Mr Tyler that "he didn't want him as  a sponsor anymore".  As far as I know, he never offered Willie the use of a phone to make that call which would have required Willie to make a collect call to Mr Tyler.  Willie called us and we got in touch with Mr Tyler who Mr Walker said would have to call Mr Walker and tell him that he wanted to drop sponsoring Willie.  Mr Tyler, who cannot take Willie to job interviews himself, understood the situation and was gracious about backing off his sponsorship.  He said he would talk to Mr Walker and tell him that.  We suggested that, once Willie had a job, it would be great for him to sponsor Willie since he lived so much closer than I do.

Now, we get to what triggered this note.  Mr Walker uses email to correspond.  I like that, but I want to give you a copy and paste dialog of my communication with Mr Walker yesterday:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr Walker,

Willie and I have spoken with Mr Taylor, the man who took Willie out recently and he is in agreement for Willie to make the switch.  Mr Taylor can't take Willie out for job interviews and I can.

In preparation for this, could you give me an outline of the procedure I would follow to take Willie to job interviews or pick up applications?  I have done this for an inmate at Orange County who found a job after about 6 weeks of searching, but I'm not sure what procedure Wake wants me to follow.

Keep in mind that I've dealt with inmates for about 7 years as a Community Volunteer.  I am well aware of the limits and have never been found in violation either in being somewhere I was not supposed to be nor in violating any of the rules associated with taking inmates out into the community.

I want to help Willie get a job and I want to follow the procedure your office outlines for doing this.  Some places we may go will not have time to talk to him, so it makes for a sort of unstable schedule.  We can hit a lot of places in a localized area to get applications, etc, so I want to be clear on what I can and can't do when taking him out to job search.

Thanks for any information you can give me on this.  I'm looking forward to getting Willie a productive job just as he had before he was abruptly moved from Durham to Wake through no fault of his own.

Mr Walker's Response:
I TOLD YOU THAT I WILL TALK TO THE SPONSOR AND GET BACK WITH YOU.  I DON'T NEED ANY OTHER INFORMATION FROM YOU AT THIS TIME.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governor,

I am a taxpaying citizen of the state of NC. I am a volunteer for the state of NC.  To be treated like this is simply insulting. 

I want to be assured that, if I become Willie's sponsor that I will not continue to be treated this way and that Willie will receive some semblence of fairness in his dealing with Programs at Wake Correctional.

I was a manager at IBM for some 12  years and I always appreciated the fact that if management didn't know about a problem, it couldn't be corrected.  I see several problems here...you may not agree on all of my points, but..

1. Mr Walker doesn't have a proper respect for the role that volunteers play in reducing recidivism and seems poorly motivated to get assistance in getting inmates back to work.

2.  In that Programs office, I have heard complaints of favoritism in allowing job interviews and phone calls.  There even appears to be a possible racial bias.  It might be good to follow up on what their numbers show as to the race of interviewees/week compared to the racial mix of inmate eligible for work release.  You may find something you don't want to find.

3. The Wake policy of allowing an inmate to have only one sponsor is unique among the three prisons I deal with and there is very little reason to justify it except they'd have to call or email a sponsor who was trying to take out the same guy on the same day and tell him there was a conflict.  (Durham does that on a regular basis)

4. The qualification process for Wake is excessive compared to Durham (4 weeks vs 2 weeks)

5. The emphasis on getting volunteers trained to take out inmates seems centered on religious services and I'm not sure that passes the smell test, although I'm comfortable with it.

Ms Perdue,  believe me I'm very interested in seeing guys stay out of prison in the long run.  I've seen you advocate for some changes in how these things are handled and I commend you for it.  I'm bringing to your attention some things that I think could be corrected in a heartbeat and would not cost the state one dime.

I'm not interested in an apology from Mr Walker, but I am interested in being treated fairly and with some level of respect and appreciation.  Be aware that, even after passing all the qualifications to be a volunteer at Wake, I still do not have my card.

Thank you,

Larry Bumgardner

PS I will also fax a copy of this to Mr Langston, prison superintendent since I don't have his email address.

Dear Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I am an operator of Assisted Living facilities in North Carolina. I have just found out that we did in fact share in the rate reductions in effect for 10/01/2009. I know you all are busy so I will get to the point. For three years we have been told by the department that CMS will not approve a State Plan Amendment for two rate increases ($.38 and $1.00) which resulted in us being promised rate increases that were not funded. The reason that the State Plan Amendment could not be approve I have been told is that the department has been knowingly out of compliance with PSC now for five or six years. My question is has the department been lying to providers about the reason these increase were never funded? It seems to me that CMS would not approve rate reductions for a program that is out of compliance if they would not approve any State Plan Amendments. I am confused on this and want to know the real truth. Have we been lied to about the funding?

Respectfully,

Governor Perdue, this must receive your attention in order to call for an immediate end to profiling and discrimination. This afternoon, I called newly appointed NC GHSP Director David Weinstein about a new NC GHSP program that profiles and discriminates against motorcyclists at motorcyclist only checkpoints. He asked me to send the accompanying news article, and to expect him to respond within two weeks. The new program mentioned in this article must end immediately.

The idea of so many motorist checkpoints in a country which prides itself on liberty and has its roots in freedom is already extremely disturbing. Profiling motorcyclists by having discriminatory motorcycle only checkpoints is even more disturbing. The fact that the attached profiling event in the attached article took place in a military community, while many troops are deployed, supposedly protecting our "freedoms" is not only deplorable but hypocritical. During the last legislative session, the legislature introduced an anti-profiling bill which the ACLU supported, (and I believe the NAACP did also), that was described as needed in order to stop racial profiling, and saying "driving while black" is not a crime. I agree. Now, to see a new NC GHSP program that profiles "driving while a motorcyclist" by subjecting motorcyclists only to checkpoints should also be considered profiling, and discrimination.

Spend our money on fixing roads and bridges, and alleviating traffic congestion, rather than on increasing discrimination and profiling of a sub-category of people, creating more "criminals" and filling up the courts that are already overflowing!

HOLLY RIDGE — Motorists racked up 19 charges during a motorcycle safety checkpoint Saturday afternoon in Holly Ridge.

The charges included one count of driving while impaired, five counts of improper display of license plate,  four counts of non-compliant helmet, three counts no motorcycle endorsement, two counts of driving while license revoked, two counts of no driver's license, one count of no insurance and one count of revoked tags.

The Jacksonville Police Department Traffic Unit assisted the Holly Ridge Police Department with the checkpoint, which was the second statewide and part of a new initiative by the Governor's Highway Safety Program.

Onslow County is ranked No. 1 in the state with the number of motor vehicle crashes that involve motorcycle fatalities, said Holly Ridge Police Sgt. Keith Whaley.

Governor Perdue, this must receive your attention in order to call for an immediate end to profiling and discrimination. This afternoon, I called newly appointed NC GHSP Director David Weinstein about a new NC GHSP program that profiles and discriminates against motorcyclists at motorcyclist only checkpoints. He asked me to send the accompanying news article, and to expect him to respond within two weeks. The new program mentioned in this article must end immediately.

The idea of so many motorist checkpoints in a country which prides itself on liberty and has its roots in freedom is already extremely disturbing. Profiling motorcyclists by having discriminatory motorcycle only checkpoints is even more disturbing. The fact that the attached profiling event in the attached article took place in a military community, while many troops are deployed, supposedly protecting our "freedoms" is not only deplorable but hypocritical. During the last legislative session, the legislature introduced an anti-profiling bill which the ACLU supported, (and I believe the NAACP did also), that was described as needed in order to stop racial profiling, and saying "driving while black" is not a crime. I agree. Now, to see a new NC GHSP program that profiles "driving while a motorcyclist" by subjecting motorcyclists only to checkpoints should also be considered profiling, and discrimination.

Spend our money on fixing roads and bridges, and alleviating traffic congestion, rather than on increasing discrimination and profiling of a sub-category of people, creating more "criminals" and filling up the courts that are already overflowing!

HOLLY RIDGE — Motorists racked up 19 charges during a motorcycle safety checkpoint Saturday afternoon in Holly Ridge.

The charges included one count of driving while impaired, five counts of improper display of license plate,  four counts of non-compliant helmet, three counts no motorcycle endorsement, two counts of driving while license revoked, two counts of no driver's license, one count of no insurance and one count of revoked tags.

The Jacksonville Police Department Traffic Unit assisted the Holly Ridge Police Department with the checkpoint, which was the second statewide and part of a new initiative by the Governor's Highway Safety Program.

Onslow County is ranked No. 1 in the state with the number of motor vehicle crashes that involve motorcycle fatalities, said Holly Ridge Police Sgt. Keith Whaley.

48 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS RECEIVE 2009
TOGETHERGREEN INNOVATION GRANTS

$1.1 Million in Funding from Audubon/Toyota Initiative
Supports Local, Solutions-based Approaches to Conservation

New York, October 8, 2009 - Forty eight projects in 23 states will receive a total of $1.1 million in TogetherGreen Innovation Grants to facilitate people-powered conservation action. TogetherGreen Innovation Grants annually provide essential funding that enables environmental groups and their community partners to inspire, equip and engage people to tackle environmental problems and better their communities.

Now in the second year of the program, nearly 90 environmental projects have received Innovation Grants totaling more than $2.5 million to protect land, water, and energy resources nationwide. 

Sample 2009 grantees and their projects include:

* Houston Audubon Society will partner with groups such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service and Texas Forest Service to engage residents in restoring native habitat on Texas's hurricane-ravaged Bolivar peninsula (TX);
* Audubon New York will partner with The Nature Conservancy, the Prospect Park Alliance and the Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment High School to offer internships and nature-based experiences enabling inner city teens to learn critical life and workplace skills;
* Palouse Audubon Society will partner with the University of Idaho Women in Science, Idaho Fish and Game, and Palouse Clearwater Environmental Institute to transform land neighboring a wastewater treatment plant into a wildlife park (Moscow, ID);
* Los Angeles Audubon Society will partner with Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Leo Politi Elementary School,and the environmental firm, Newfields, to put teens on the front line of coastal sage scrub restoration (Los Angeles, CA);
* Montana Audubon will work with the Western Sustainability Exchange, Yellowstone River Parks Association, and Billings West High School to help educate consumers about the importance of selecting environmentally friendly beef that has been  produced by ranchers who protect habitat on their properties (Billings and Helena MT)
A complete list of all 48 grants is available at <http://toyota.cmail2.com/t/y/l/kukjw/kylltkhlt/j>www.togethergreen.org/grants.

"TogetherGreen Innovation Grants offer tremendous opportunities for environmental groups to flex their creative muscles in tackling conservation issues and building a broader, more active constituency," said Audubon President John Flicker. "We believe this second round of funding will continue to jump start conservation success by broadening the ranks of those involved and providing support that will allow measurable results to take root."

The 2009 Innovation Grant recipients were selected from scores of applicants across America. Funds were awarded to local Chapters or programs of Audubon's large national network – each working in partnership with one or more outside groups. Recipients were chosen for innovation and effectiveness of projects designed to contribute to significant gains in habitat, water, and energy conservation. Many projects will work with inner-city audiences and those previously underserved or not engaged with the environmental community.

"It's hard to inspire kids to get involved with natural resources just through the classroom, so our work with Audubon will help spark the flame so they can get their hands dirty and learn how to really tackle some real-life problems out in the field," said Dr. Diana Doan-Crider, Research Associate, Texas A&M University, who is partnering with Audubon Texas to offer environmental internships to underrepresented ethnic groups throughout the state. "There's nothing like a live animal or a beautiful landscape to trigger a young person's imagination."

Selected 2009 proposals will receive grants ranging from $5,000 - $80,000. The grants are proving especially important as non-profit groups weather the financial recession. The 2008 grant recipients leveraged an estimated $4.5 million in additional matching and in-kind support that allowed them to broaden their scope and deliver tremendous conservation potential.

"Generating one green watt of energy where it is being used will save the emissions produced by coal generation of three watts," said Bob Barnhill, President, Sonoita Crossroads Community Forum, who is partnering with Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch to reduce carbon emissions in rural communities. "We can educate our residents in conservation of resources as well as our connection to the earth."

Since launching TogetherGreen in March 2008, the five-year alliance between Audubon and Toyota has provided leadership training, conservation education and outreach, volunteer events, and grant funding to generate impressive new results. Success stories from 2008 Innovation Grants projects helped inspire a new state law requiring high-rises in Minnesota to turn off unnecessary lighting every year during spring and fall migrations; planted over 68,000 trees planted and restored more than 325 acres of land including grasslands in Missouri and Pennsylvania, wetlands in California, and forests in Vermont; reached over 6,000 people with one third of the projects targeting people of color and more than half reaching low-income communities. The progress represents crucial steps in addressing big problems – from habitat degradation to wasteful consumption – that can be solved only through concerted, long-term conservation action.

Audubon Chapters, programs, Centers, sanctuaries and even independent Audubon groups interested in receiving funding for creative, collaborative environmental projects are encouraged to apply for a 2010 TogetherGreen Innovation Grant. Applications will be available online beginning in winter 2010 at <http://toyota.cmail2.com/t/y/l/kukjw/kylltkhlt/t>www.togethergreen.org/grants.

Dear Governor,

Green jobs aplenty could be generated by using your executive order #23 to harvest energy and fresh water from wind, tides

solar and osmotic pressure, all in one device.

In addition, the anchoring system of artificial reefs could increase sea life and subsequent revenues from tourism and licensing.

The technology is all "Off the shelf" and could be manufactured in NC but supplied to the rest of the world from here.

I live in Winston Salem NC and am a 30 year veteran of New Product Development and also a US Navy veteran.

(I have 15 patents or so) see www.uspto.gov

I would like to lay out the concepts and plan to an NC State agency that might help make this happen.

Please contact, (Or refer me/forward this request to the correct office)

My suggested route to Oriental is to take I-40 toward Wilmington, and take the new US70 Bypass to Goldsboro

[ below the Clayton exit]then

 TakeUS70 to New Bern.  At New Bern go across the Neuse River Bridge (follow the NC 55 signs), follow NC55 to Oriental (through Bayboro).



When you get to Oriental, turn left on Church St,  go to the Neuse River, turn right on South Street.  The Crisco house is the first one on the left. Next to the small park..  The trip should take about 2 ½ hours.

Governor Perdue,

Sterling Hennis is our mutual friend.  He was my mentor-and he may have taught you, I'm not sure.

A policy matter I'd like to mention follows:

I've just become aware of the wide-very wide-differences in what our state employees at UNCW (and other employees, I assume) pay in family premiums for health insurance with Blue Cross and what OTHER STATES ALL AROUND US are paying.

My colleague, Ben George, did some research, and the below is from an email he sent the rest of us in my department.

 Effective this past July, our monthly family premium rose 8.9% to $533.

Monthly premiums that state employees pay for family coverage in the four states adjoining North Carolina (South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia) -- states that one would assume to have similar health demographics -- are all lower. Significantly lower. Here they are:

Virginia $116
South Carolina $147
Tennessee $253
Georgia $393

And this does not take into account the fact that deductibles and other ancillary concerns are lower there as well. I also decided to look beyond the region, and chose seven further states at random, ranging from the Northeast to the Midwest to the West. Again, significantly lower. Here are those monthly premiums:

California $146
Connecticut $154
Indiana $76
Missouri $294
Nevada $108
Ohio $205
Wisconsin $412

Did you know about this, and can you give me and idea if and what is being done about this-from your office.  I am astounded and can't imagine what is going on!  And it's hard for me to believe that our legislators have these numbers and aren't acting.

I know you're very busy, but could you let me know if you recieved this.

Thanks, All Best,
Clyde Edgerton

Gov. Perdue Focuses on Green,  Defense/Aerospace Jobs
Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity. "Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come." Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 [cid:3338004828_1288739] grant from the One North Carolina Fund. "North Carolina, the nation's most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces," Perdue said.  "Our state's skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses." North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County. The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue's JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

[cid:3338004828_1262983] Governor Attends AUSA Conference in Washington, DC Gov. Perdue on Monday attended the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC.  In an effort to grow our military/aerospace economy, Gov. Perdue spent the day meeting with companies about locating in North Carolina.  She also met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke regarding funding to expand broadband access - the e-NC Authority is to receive $2 million in federal funds. Pictured here is Governor Perdue with General Dunwoody, the nation's first female four-star general.
Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School
Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled. "When our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn," said Perdue. "This partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need." The North Carolina "Healthy & Ready to Learn" (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children. The governor also announced that North Carolina received $17 million from a competitive federal grant to expand coverage for uninsured working families, and nearly $3.9 million for Rural Hope, a program that will improve health care facilities in rural North Carolina.
Submit Your Suggestions to the StreetSafe Task Force
The first meeting of Gov. Perdue's StreetSafe Task Force <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630>  was on Thursday.  The task force is charged with finding ways to transition prisoners and probationers back to work instead of back to crime. As part of the meeting members heard an overview of sentencing and recidivism in North Carolina and around the country, and they discussed their own ideas about how best to keep offenders out of prison and away from crime.  They also encourage the public to submit their own suggestions and recommendations.  You can contact the task force at www.streetsafe.nc.gov <http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov><http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov> . Attorney General Roy Cooper and Department of Corrections Secretary Alvin Keller co-chair the task force, which is made up of government, civic, community and law enforcement representatives.
Gov. Perdue Encourages Citizens to Provide Input for State Service Plan
Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is asking for the public's input on the state's service needs for its three-year state service plan.  The Commission will feature a survey on its Web site, www.volunteernc.org <http://www.volunteernc.org><http://www.volunteernc.org> , from Oct. 5-12th. "I encourage North Carolina citizens to provide their input and become a part of shaping our state's service and volunteerism goals," said Perdue. "To create the most comprehensive plan, we need to hear as many people's opinions on North Carolina's human, education, environmental and public safety needs." The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is required by law to develop a three-year state service plan to submit to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).  The plan is to establish and recognize the state's priorities and address areas of community and state needs to improve lives and strengthen communities.  The 2010-2012 State Service Plan is due to CNCS in early November. To access the survey, please visit www.volunteernc.org <http://www.volunteernc.org><http://www.volunteernc.org> .

Good afternoon,



I may have responded on this situation before; if so please excuse the repetition. 



The situation in New Hanover County falls under the purview of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rather than a state agency.  I believe that the group is seeking the support of the Governor's Office in endorsing corrections to the New Hanover County Tax Parcel I.D. Mapping System. Fifty-seven properties were inadvertently placed into the Coastal Barriers Resource System.



If I can be of further assistance please don't hesitate to contact me.

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=665>Executive Order 24 to extend North Carolina General Statute 133-32, the state’s gift ban, to cover all executive branch state employees. Currently, the ban applies only to a limited number of employees who are directly involved with contracts, or the inspection or supervision of construction.

> “This executive order makes it clear — those of us who serve the people of North Carolina must be held to the highest ethical standards and act accordingly,” said Perdue. “Citizens expect and deserve nothing less.”

> Within the next 30 days, all executive branch agencies are required to:

> • Review with employees the executive order and NCGS 133-32 and inform them that violation of NCGS 133-32 is a class one misdemeanor and may subject employees to disciplinary action.
> • Require all employees to certify in writing that they have received a copy of and reviewed the executive order, NCGS 133-32 and any other relevant agency policies.
> • Establish a process of providing a copy of the statute and executive order as part of new employee orientation.
> • Report to the Governor’s Ethics Officer regarding compliance with the executive order.

> The Department of Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Office of Information Technology Services and all other cabinet agencies will be required to include a provision about NCGS 133-32 and the executive order in all new RFPs and the North Carolina General Contract Terms and Conditions.  The Department also must notify all current contractors regarding the executive order.

> 17 Contracts Totaling More Than $65 Million Awarded for Highway, Ferry Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that 17 contracts totaling $65.2 million have been awarded for highway, bridge and ferry projects across North Carolina, including eight projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The N.C. Department of Transportation awarded the contracts to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law. A list of the projects is attached.

> “These projects will stimulate economic growth by creating and sustaining jobs for North Carolinians while making lasting investments in our transportation system,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> The eight recovery projects are located in Alamance, Alleghany, Buncombe, Caswell, Madison, Northampton, Orange and Surry counties. The nine other projects are located in Bladen, Columbus, Cumberland, Harnett, Henderson, Hyde, McDowell and Person counties. See the attached list for respective start dates.

> The bids received on all 17 projects advertised came in 21.7 percent, or about $18 million, below NCDOT estimates.

UFS Holdings-Premiere Fibers Inc., a national manufacturer of yarn products made from synthetic fiber, will expand in Anson County.  The company plans to invest $2.5 million and create 20 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $50,200 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina remains attractive to national manufacturing firms, thanks to our skilled workforce, superb quality of life and business-friendly policies,” Perdue said.  “Companies like UFS Holdings are succeeding through the investment and jobs they bring to our state.”

> UFS, or Universal Fiber Systems, is headquartered in Virginia. The company also has facilities in China and Thailand and owns the Premiere Fibers Inc. plant in Ansonville.  The plant produces synthetic continuous filament for diverse uses in the military, industrial, technical, apparel, hosiery, upholstery and other markets.

Subject: State retirement



I am a 24 year veteran teacher of North Carolina, 27 years teaching total.  Unfortunately, I withdrew 8 years of my retirment fund many years back.  To purchase that time would be very expensive with the interest that has accrued.  My question is:  will there be a program to allow state employees to buy back their years for the purpose of early retirement with a reduction in the interest due?  I believe it was done several years ago.  I am looking forward to retirement but can't quite afford it (I am about to be 60) unless i am able to buy back my years.  I think a buy out program would help reduce the cost of teacher salaries and would bring money into the state.  Thank you for listening to my ideas.

Subject: Sterling Hennis, Health Care Premiums

Governor Perdue,

Sterling Hennis is our mutual friend.  He was my mentor-and he may have taught you, I'm not sure.

A policy matter I'd like to mention follows:

I've just become aware of the wide-very wide-differences in what our state employees at UNCW (and other employees, I assume) pay in family premiums for health insurance with Blue Cross and what OTHER STATES ALL AROUND US are paying.

My colleague, Ben George, did some research, and the below is from an email he sent the rest of us in my department.

 Effective this past July, our monthly family premium rose 8.9% to $533.

Monthly premiums that state employees pay for family coverage in the four states adjoining North Carolina (South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia) -- states that one would assume to have similar health demographics -- are all lower. Significantly lower. Here they are:

Virginia $116
South Carolina $147
Tennessee $253
Georgia $393

And this does not take into account the fact that deductibles and other ancillary concerns are lower there as well. I also decided to look beyond the region, and chose seven further states at random, ranging from the Northeast to the Midwest to the West. Again, significantly lower. Here are those monthly premiums:

California $146
Connecticut $154
Indiana $76
Missouri $294
Nevada $108
Ohio $205
Wisconsin $412

Did you know about this, and can you give me and idea if and what is being done about this-from your office.  I am astounded and can't imagine what is going on!  And it's hard for me to believe that our legislators have these numbers and aren't acting.

I know you're very busy, but could you let me know if you recieved this.

Thanks, All Best,
Clyde Edgerton

Gov. Perdue Focuses on Green,  Defense/Aerospace Jobs
Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity. "Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come." Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 [cid:3338004828_1288739] grant from the One North Carolina Fund. "North Carolina, the nation's most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces," Perdue said.  "Our state's skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses." North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County. The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue's JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future. For information on North American Aerodynamics, go to http://naaero.com.  For more information on job opportunities, or to submit a resume, contact Patsy Jones at namerican.hr@gmail.com. [cid:3338004828_1262983] Governor Attends AUSA Conference in Washington, DC Gov. Perdue on Monday attended the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC.  In an effort to grow our military/aerospace economy, Gov. Perdue spent the day meeting with companies about locating in North Carolina.  She also met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke regarding funding to expand broadband access - the e-NC Authority is to receive $2 million in federal funds. Pictured here is Governor Perdue with General Dunwoody, the nation's first female four-star general.
Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School
Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled. "When our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn," said Perdue. "This partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need." The North Carolina "Healthy & Ready to Learn" (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children. The governor also announced that North Carolina received $17 million from a competitive federal grant to expand coverage for uninsured working families, and nearly $3.9 million for Rural Hope, a program that will improve health care facilities in rural North Carolina.
Submit Your Suggestions to the StreetSafe Task Force
The first meeting of Gov. Perdue's StreetSafe Task Force <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630>  was on Thursday.  The task force is charged with finding ways to transition prisoners and probationers back to work instead of back to crime. As part of the meeting members heard an overview of sentencing and recidivism in North Carolina and around the country, and they discussed their own ideas about how best to keep offenders out of prison and away from crime.  They also encourage the public to submit their own suggestions and recommendations.  You can contact the task force at www.streetsafe.nc.gov <http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov><http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov> . Attorney General Roy Cooper and Department of Corrections Secretary Alvin Keller co-chair the task force, which is made up of government, civic, community and law enforcement representatives.
Gov. Perdue Encourages Citizens to Provide Input for State Service Plan
Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is asking for the public's input on the state's service needs for its three-year state service plan.  The Commission will feature a survey on its Web site, www.volunteernc.org <http://www.volunteernc.org><http://www.volunteernc.org> , from Oct. 5-12th. "I encourage North Carolina citizens to provide their input and become a part of shaping our state's service and volunteerism goals," said Perdue. "To create the most comprehensive plan, we need to hear as many people's opinions on North Carolina's human, education, environmental and public safety needs." The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is required by law to develop a three-year state service plan to submit to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).  The plan is to establish and recognize the state's priorities and address areas of community and state needs to improve lives and strengthen communities.  The 2010-2012 State Service Plan is due to CNCS in early November. To access the survey, please visit www.volunteernc.org <http://www.volunteernc.org><http://www.volunteernc.org> .

                        Congratulations on your your son's marriage last weekend.  That is truly an exciting time.  Many people have said to me that the extra ferry ran to Ocracoke to accomodate wedding guests.  They said that NC citizens will foot that bill.  I told them I did not want to hear gossip, but would contact you and ask if the ferry was funded by your family or the state.  It is important for NC citizens to know where their money is going.  I think a lot of people are gunshy after the last governor.  I will await your reply and not speak of this issue until I hear from you.  Thank you.

Comment: Please join me in my fight to make a difference in the lives of the more than 1 million Americans living with autism today. http://www.walknowforautism.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=303381&lis=1&kntae303381=F49223F5B0944D0A98357F2231A11544&supId=272860649 I am participating in Walk Now for Autism to help find a cure for autism. Autism is the second most common developmental disorder in the United States affecting one in every 150 children born today. Despite some promising discoveries, the cause of autism is unknown and a cure does not exist. Research is crucial. Every 20 minutes another child is diagnosed with autism. Not only must we find ways to improve the quality of life for children and adults with autism, but we also must find a cure, and soon. Walk Now for Autism is our chance to make a difference in the fight against autism by raising money for autism research and heightening public awareness. Please join me in my fight as I raise money to help fund essential research. You can donate to Walk Now for Autism and/or join my team online using the links at the bottom of this page. Donations can also be mailed to Autism Speaks using the donation form located on my page or send me a check made out to Autism Speaks. Thank you for taking an important step in the fight against autism. Donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law.

Subject: Unemployment Rate

Comment: I don't have a question I have a concern regarding the unemployment rate and myself. I have been unemployed since May22,2009. I have been actively searching for work and have received several offers, but because companies are now using credit/consumer reports as part of the qualifying criteria i was disqualified from each position. I have a daughter who has severe medical problems and we are currently on public assistance but that doesn't pay the bills. How can we get a job if my credit won't allow me. The longer i'm out of work the worse my credit will get and my daughter and i will be forced to become homeless. something needs to be done about the hiring process of these companies or the unemployment rate will continue to climb.

Comment: Dear Governor, How can it possibly be that the state sales tax has been raised, highways surrounding Charlotte (I'll remind you one of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.) continue to be put on hold due to lack of funding, and teachers are being furloughed in Mecklenburg County, yet North Carolina has funding to knock down and rebuild ABC stores? How can it be? How CAN it be? Regards, Kim Cook Small Business Owner

Makenzie loves school and is very quick to learn and
 the more we can do to make it fun for her we will.
Address is below, On the message side put it to Makenzie
and your signature or office.
Thank you for anything you can do for her project.

Subject: A cry for help















To whom it may concern,



        I am one person crying out for help I have two sons that really needs these program please help them and other kids like them.  Local communities have begun eliminating programs in response to the state's budget cuts. Thousands of individuals are losing access to some or all of their services.  Small and large North Carolina-based service providers are going out of business; 48 providers have thus far notified the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services about discontinuing services.  Medicaid rate cuts, cuts to state funded services, massive systemic overhaul of case management, and child residential treatment have created an avalanche of destruction that is now crashing down upon the frail and brittle service system that was established to support North Carolina's most vulnerable citizens.


As with other emergencies, The Coalition will demand that the Governor call a Special Session to correct the inhumane budgetary choices made by Legislators this past Legislative Session, and that the Administration be given emergency powers to effect crucial changes necessary to neutralize the impending threats to heath and safety.  Jennifer Mahan, Chair of The Coalition, says, "Budget cuts have put North Carolina's mental health, developmental disability and addictive disease system in a state of emergency and we expect our state's leaders to treat this as they would any other crisis." 

There are a lot of students in North Carolina that waste taxpayers money but I know these programs are not one. Kids like my sons need these programs to have the opportunities to excel in life.  They Should have the same chance to learn and grow just like a student that doesn't have to work as hard.
