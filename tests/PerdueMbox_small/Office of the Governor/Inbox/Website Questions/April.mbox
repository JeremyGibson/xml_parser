Governor Perdue:

I DO NOT support the proposed tax increase on the tobacco industry.  This is an outrageous attack on a potential 50,000 jobs at a time when so many people are struggling.  

More than 50,000 jobs in North Carolina are related to tobacco production, manufacturing and distribution and this does not include all the other jobs and lives which will be negatively impacted.  While unemployment in the state is currently at 9.7%, the Triad is facing 10.4%; the impact of this will greatly increase that.

The federal government just increased the federal tobacco tax by $.62.  It is projected by many economist that this will cause a loss of 3000 jobs and impact many more lives in NC.  Just think about the ramifications of a $1 tax increase per pack.  

This is a regressive tax which will greatly harm many people in the state.  

-55% of smokers are working poor
-One in four smokers lives below the poverty line
-Median family income of NC smokers is $33,437
-80% of smokers make less that $75,000

At a time when the economy is struggling, now is not the time to target the working people of NC.  

Please reconsider this tax increase.  It is not fair, equitable or right.  

We must protect many thousands of jobs in NC - this tax increase is a bad idea!

I know you care about getting the economy back on track.  This is not the way to do it.

Good afternoon-
My name is Jim Reitzel and I have been a resident of Guilford county for
the past 59 years and a registered Democrat since 1971.
I would like to express my dismay at the proposed State tax increase on
cigarettes.
During  a time of double digit unemployment, it simply makes no sense to
risk the probable loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
A tax increase in a time of recession is problematic at best, but to try
and alter the lifestyles of millions of NC citizens at this time can only
spell financial disaster.
I understand the reasons for the increase and perhaps in a time of
financial stability, it is a notion worth considering. But please do not
make this a defining moment for the Democratic party. We have fought too
long and too hard for the status that we claim. To drive the state further
into financial difficulty is not a legacy that we wish to leave behind us.
Thanks for your attention
Jim Reitzel

Dear Bev Perdue
    I'm a smoker and started and it's a hard thing to quit I've tried but it is something when I went to school they told us and took us on a fieldtrip in school about how tobacco built this state( I've still got the field trip photos from school). Now I feel like  I'm being punished for smoking by trying to take all my money from my family. Economy is tough and I'm a small business owner and it is tough. So why of all times are you'll trying to destroy what I've worked hard for. I feel like every right I have is being stripped caused you'll need money for something that will never help my family and we aren't talking pocket change.
    If you'll have any care for the issues of the people please let me know why I have been singled out so much for being a smoker.
         Thanks Johnny Kaylor

Subject: Waiting

Comment: I'm just writing to inquire as to where my state income tax refund might be??? We filed almost two months ago electronically and still, no funds. Are they, by chance, paying for some social program for a non-taxpaying resident (or illegal)? At what point will the state of NC begin paying interest for holding onto our money? If you want to stimulate the economy, pay the citizens what you owe and be assured, we'll spend it!

Subject: Request regarding U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Department

Comment: Upon learning that I, as a resident U.S. citizen grandmother could apply for citizenship for my South African born grandson, filed an application last year 2008 with the Department in Durham. He is turning 18 in October at which time he is no longer eligible as an under 18. I have made several trips to Durham to speak with them and have written several letters, but have received no paperwork or any written reply from them. We have requested end of June and beginning of July for his interview with the Immigration Officer since this is the only school break during this important school year. Is there anything that you could do or call that you could make to help me see this application through to a successful conclusion by end of June this year? This is a N-600K, Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate Under Section 322 for Jason Scott Schroeder. Thank you in advance for you help. Jeanette Allen

Comment: Hello, my name is Edson Parra. I am currently a student at Western Carolina University studying Forensic Biology, Political Science and a minor in Music, also in the Pre-Med and Pre-Law pathways. I intend on getting my JD/MD degree after finishing undergraduate work here. I am a 19 year old Mexican male. I am fluent in both english and spanish. I am trying to find out if there is any possible way that I can have a summer internship with the Governor's Advisory Council on Hispanic Latino Affairs. North Carolina's Hispanic and Latino is growing everyday and I believe that I could be an asset to this council. If you would please contact me let know if there is any possible way that I could help. I am not looking to get paid, I am looking for the knowledge that I would acquire through being a part of the council to the Governor. Thank you, Edson Parra

Subject: NC Driving License

Comment: My daughter just received a letter in the mail today to let her know that her driving license has been revoke. Because she didn't meet the required standards to keep them. I think this should be look into because there is a difference in students who try their hardest and the ones who don't. My daughter has not miss one day of school in the last four years and has always had good grades and has won awards the past three years for her aconpolishments. She couldn't past a state test that you can't study for and she feels that she is being punish for doing her best. Now she wants to quit school because she feels like a failure and I don't think her or any other child should ever feel that way. I wish this law could be changed and go by the classroom grades that they receive in class and NOT by the state made test that makes it hard a child to past. Please check into this for future children so that the ones who really do try and care don't feel like they are being punish for doing their best. Sincerly, Pamela Lloyd

Sin taxes should include alcohol, pornography, escort and other adult entertainment services, sports events, high fructose foods and drinks. If you discriminate too vehemently against smokers and they take their business elsewhere, who will you profit from and exploit then?

Subject: SHAFTED BY A sMALL TOWNS PURGURY

Comment: The 2nd Amendment confirms the God given right of free men and women to defend with deadly force (as a last resort) against government tyranny and oppression. It is YOU having the force of arms to so defend. Get over "fuzzy labels" and worthless trivia about "sporting purposes", games, and your "right" to hunt. More serious issues are at stake. "Gun control" is about disarming law abiding citizens. It deals with deadly force by government, and directly impacts freedom, life, and death. Think about it. There is only one guarantee if you are disarmed - the Government, military, and criminals will have weapons and guns. They will be the exclusive holders of "force". As such, they will control you (they will OWN you and your family). With force, at their whim, they will decide what is to be "done" with you. Thus, for any honest discussion of "gun control", history and the images of government tyranny and oppression MUST be brought into strong focus. Yet, today, "politically correct discussion" ignores that critical topic - "The Deadly Force of Governments". Some "gun rights" groups intentionally stay away from the topic saying - we don't want to "alienate" or "turn people off", or say - "we don't want to sound extreme". With all due respect, gun confiscation sparked the American Revolution. People died. Today, we witness governments murdering civilians all around the globe (for power, greed, wealth etc...). The pictures of reality are before us. It's time to take off the rose colored glasses. It's time to start being honest in the American Gun Control Debate. The cost of ignoring reality and history WILL be deadly. In the last century about 170 MILLION people were murdered by their own governments. The question is: do you want a repeat? The fact is that the Business End of Tyrannical and Oppressive Government hasn't changed - Governments still enslave, confiscate, steal, over tax, kill, rape, torture and mutilate. The only difference is that this time, you and your family will be tomorrows history lesson. So, when politicians say they are doing it "for the children" - look behind what they actually do, and what they have done: Government Vs. Second Amendment: Self Defense is Your Right, Your Duty. Click and Enter - caution graphic images. "Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master". George Washington.

I am against the rising of taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and NOT spreading it out OVER everyone in the state, Taxing a few is not the solution to YOUR problem Ban cell phone use on the highways in the state and charge people for their stupidness eveyone on the roadways are on the phone these days and far surpassing the DUI laws in accidents and deaths BUT I guess by collecting taxes you all sit on your fat butts and collect money from someone else to do it for you. IF you would enfoce the laws in this state like headlights on while raining and seatbelts and collect form that but that would MEAN you would have to PAY someone else to enforce those laws You are just as bad as the people asking for bail outs your asking for money but laying people off and cutting hours YOUR A HIPOCRITE Again sorry I voted for you.

Subject: Charity Worley

Comment: Dear Honorable Purdue Thank you so much for the reward that was recently offered by the governors office to help find my daughters killer. this has been a most difficult time for us. I have been disabled for several years. Charity had taken both me and my younger daughter in. I kept her 17 month old son while she worked and her husband served as a private contractor in Iraq. Since this has happened our entire family has been totally torn asunder. Not only from finding our beloved Charity beaten to death, but we found ourselves homeless. My younger daughter, Lindsey (whom charity had also taken in, we called ourselves the three musketeers) were able to find an apartment with the housing authority. I am very grateful. I have found that my standard of living has been so greatly reduced that I have had a great comeuppance! I was indeed quite a snob. We keep Charity's son 4 days a week. Her husband is home from Iraq and he has on days he does not work. We are having a very difficult time. I am disabled and cannot drive much of the time. I am in and out fo the hospital in Chapel Hill a lot. Charity was my transportation. IN fact I depended on her for so much. I did not realize just how much. It up to Lindsey now and she does not have drivers license. We were told she was eligible and borrowed the money to get the interlock system put on my car and insurance on the car only to get to DMV and find it was a typo. She is eligible in October. She is a single mom with the responsiblity of myself, her 5 month old child, and charity's child. Is there any way the governors office can help us to get a restricted license for her to drive me to and from drs appts. Last week there was a drug bust in our neighborhood, not to seem ungrateful but are there any programs for families displaced by violent crimes. We do not want our children growing up subjected to the language and environment we live in. I had no idea that anyone's life could be so drastically altered in a matter of moments. We lost the beautiful person who was my precious daughter. She served her country. She was a wonderful mother, friend, daughter, sister, someone who would do anything for you. As witnessed by the fact that she was providing a home for her family. It was a given that this was to be my home for as long as I lived. A mother should never outlive her children. I lost my home and my way of life. I lost my transportation to drs and hospitals, but mostly I lost my Charity. The child I gave birth to, I won't hear her hit the landing again and shout "Where's my Boogs? (her pet name for her son). I won't here her giggle, I won't feel her skinny little arms hug me, God, I miss her. I am sincerely praying that the reward will brimg whomver is responsible out of the woodwork. I do so thank you.

Subject: Health Care Changes.

Comment: Dear Governor: As a teacher of 21 years, I am concerned about the change you and the legislature are making in OUR health benefits. It feels like you are discriminating against people because of their genetic make up. Most people that I work with will not be able to meet the body weight mass index. I challenge you and the legislative representatives and senators to meet the requirements you are asking us to me before requiring a change in the insurance plan. You are actually creating a group of second class citizens by categorizing your employees through this method.

Subject: NC Budget Proposal

Comment: Dear Govenor Perdue, It is my understanding that the budget that is being presented to the General Assembly soon, contains sections 9.7.(a) and 9.7. (b) G.S. 116-238.1(a). This is the REPEAL FULL TUITION GRANT FOR GRADUATES OF NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND MATH (NCSSM)WHO ATTEND A STATE UNIVERSITY. I certainly understand the tough economic times we are facing and appreciate the hard work you are doing to keeping our state in good shape along with what you have done for the education of our children in North Carolina. I donât necessarily consider this a grant, as a grant is something that is considered a privilege or a right. I think of this as a scholarship that my daughter, Marseille Mosher, acquired by studying hard for twelve years, the last two at NCSSM. When Marseille was in 7th grade her mother and I started preparing her for NCSSM with the hopes of her graduating with the promised grant. I firmly believe that Marseille has upheld her end of the agreement by graduating from NCSSM on June 6, 2009. With two months to go before graduation, I feel that it is unfair to eliminate this promised grant. I have a son who is awaiting word from NCSSM for entry into the class of 2011. He too has worked hard to be considered eligible to attend this school. My youngest daughter also wants to attend NCSSM. They want to attend NCSSM because of the challenging academics. I agree with them but the grant would also be a great help. I do know a few NCSSM graduates that have gone to college in North Carolina and continued with Graduate school in North Carolina. I fear that many of these students, along with my children, will leave the state for schools that offer scholarships, and never return to North Carolina. This of course would further depress the stateâs taxable income. I urge you to reconsider this repeal of the tuition grant that would offer a new opportunity for students to drift to other states, even more so for those âhigh achieversâ that this grant is designed to help keep in North Carolina. In this time of great economic challenges, education is the key to Americaâs success and to that of North Carolina as well. Respectfully, Joseph A. Mosher 319 Jackson St. Roanoke Rapids, NC 27870

Comment: I have been an educator for 25 years at Laney High School in Wilmington, NC. Twelve years of that were spent coaching and the other thirteen have been dedicated to a great deal of life coaching for all students. I would very much like you to visit the Laney High School Gymnasium and go through both the girls and boys locker areas and see if any child should have to deal with such facilities. They have been in this condition for all of my years there. At present there is also a Title IX Compliance Review for the entire county. This is due to folks never having the forsight or a plan to upgrade facilities. We are known statewide as the "BANDAID" county of the state. It would be great to get a response. And thanks for all you do.

Subject: Tobacco tax

Comment: Hello Governor Perdue, I understand your intentions as to taxing tobacco use, but I see some problems that could be easily corrected and still allow NC to collect extra monies. If we increase the tax on cigarettes many people will strive to quit, the very poor will not be able to afford to by them, and tobacco workers will be laid off due to the decrease in sales. As you can see, with less sales, the tax increase will not do very well due to less sales. It will also cause a large group of voters to be very disgruntled, and those who lose their jobs will be an additional burden upon the state. In order to prevent this from happening and still receive additional revenue, just simply tax those who sell tobacco products. Just as alconol dealers have to pay a yearly licensure fee, let the tobacco sellers do the same. Then, people will be allowed to purchase tobacco at about the same price while the state collects annual licensing fees from thousands of merchants.

Subject: sin tax

Comment: The Sin Tax was once a remarkable revenue maker but the number of smokers (mostly middle to lower class)left will not be able to provide the revenue that you are expecting. What about the Fat Tax on fast-food? The McDonaldâs in one location in Charlotte had an est. annual sales of $970,000). The âFat or Fast Taxâ would make people think to eat at home (as a family) and save money. This would also help combat the health problems that not only NC but US as a whole. The heart-attack rates have increases because our waist- lines have increased. Our children would also benefit (the growing number keeps rising). In addition the death tax will be resurrected so all those NC residents that die because of the growing waist line that leads to heart attacks, diabetes, etc will be able to pay more money to you and the White House. I did not vote for you for this; and I will not make the mistake the next time, I promise. Why not this type of tax to replace the sin tax?

Subject: Medicid

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am a 61 year old female diagnosed with Bilateral Breast Cancer which resulted in removal of both breast. Afterwards, I had bilateral knee replacement. When I returned to work I was laid off due to down-sizing (economy). Due to the substantial medical bill and the medications I am taking, I felt my only option was to apply for Medicaid. This government office deferred me to the Disability office in which I was declined. Soon afterwards, I received notice that Medicaid was also denied. I'm appealing Medicaid but it can take up to 180 days. I have an MD appt scheduled or June and a CT Scan scheduled for July. I can not afford these medical bills and my current medications. I will be out of my Cancer medication in 6 days and can not afford to pay cash for anymore. This will cost me my life. I am very angry to know that I am a United States Born Ameican and I can not receive any government benefits. Yet, we have foreigners that reap the benefits that I was required to pay in-to at the time I was working. They receive Medicaid and Food Stamps at the drop of a hat. No questions asked. Where is the justice in this system? What can you do to fix this broken system? Do you think this is a broken system?

Subject: HELP!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, One morning that we had school, we were just getting ready to go to the bus stop, and little man (our dog) came and ran out the door. So we just decided to let him use the bathroom. And then we were walking and we got to our bus stop, and this one boy named Michael Smith had his dog there. The only people that were there was Michael, his little sister, and my brothers and my sister, J.D, Johnathan, and Jessica, and me, Maegan. Well we were just waiting for the bus to come and Michael was pretending to sick his dog on ours and my brother J.D was telling him to stop doing that. And J.D was holding little man by the collar so nothing bad would happen. Well Michael thought it was funny and we didnât. Michael sicked his dog on mine and let his go to attack little man. And then all of a sudden, his dog was on top of little man shaking him like he was a chew toy. Little manâs eyes were green and were bulging out. They looked like they were about to pop out. Then Michaels mom came down and one of my neighbors. And my neighbor, Cynthia Winker, was hitting him all over trying to break him loose from my dog with a two by four, because my dog hadnât done anything to Michaelâs dog. Michaels dog also had drug my two brothers in the ditch. Well we live on a hill and I had to run up to my house to get my parents to try to do something, if they could. I was crying and I was out of breath, I could hardly breath I was panicking so badly!! I finally got to the house and my parents were just going to sleep and I walked in and said â heâs got him in a ditch, heâs killing him, you got to do somethingâ. And my mom just kept on saying â who, who, whoâ. But I was so out of breath form trying to run up here, I just couldnât talk any more. So my dad got his shot gun, because we lived in the mountains and he didnât know what had who in the ditch, and he drove the car. And me and my mom ran down to the bus stop. The women had repeatedly hit Michaels dog just trying to save my dogs life! Everybody was saying âmake it stopâ My dad tried poking him in the side with the shot gun. And that didnât help, and the dog still had little man in his mouth trying to kill him. So my dad shot him in the ditch where the dog was killing little man. I was crying like crazy because my dog was nearly dead. I thought he was going to die that day. Mrs. Perdue, my dad is not guilty for protecting me and my family, including my dog. Please let him have his gun rights back. I was 8 when this all happened, and now I am 13. Please find him not guilty.For this was a mistrial! Sincerely, Maegan Amber Michelle Dockery. Thanks.

Subject: Families of Youth with Substance Use Addiction: A National Dialogue

Comment: Gov. Perdue, This past weekend, I represented NC at the Families of Youth with Substance Use Addiction: A National Dialogue. I am sending our press release to you so that you are aware of our work. Thank you, Linda Warden (910-681-0835) Substance use disorders are problems that affected over 22 million people in the United States (SAMHSA, 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health). The financial costs of this disease are not only for treatment and health care, but also for legal and incarceration costs, and for the loss of productivity. These costs have grown to approximately $1 trillion dollars per year in the United States (Alcohol Abuse, December 2008). We all pay whether or not someone in our family has the disease. Substance abuse and dependence are enormous problems, but there is hope. Studies have shown that for youth with substance use disorders, addiction treatment, using methods that have been proven to be effective, and that include the family, result in excellent chances of recovery from the disease. This past weekend (March 27-28), a national dialogue took place in Rockville, MD. The meeting included 65 members of families of youth impacted by the disease of addiction from 34 states and tribes across the United States, along with representatives from Georgetown University, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Family members identified several challenge areas in treatment and recovery for youth with substance use disorders. The top two challenges are 1) a lack of education and information support for family members and 2) a lack of access to substance abuse treatment for youth and their families. Other challenges include 3) a lack of integrated treatment for youth with both substance abuse and mental health disorders, 4) the stigma and misunderstanding of the disease of substance abuse and addiction, and 5) the quality of treatment for youth with the disease. Work was begun at the conference to build a national clearinghouse to contain a centralized repository of information for families and others who need this information. Also, web accessible training will occur on topics such as financial strategies for providing treatment, recovery services, and education on addiction issues. Family representatives from the states and tribes developed a plan to immediately begin working on the major issues in their state/tribe, to meet with state/tribe substance abuse agency heads and other parent organizations, and to make affirmative changes in the challenge areas not only in their state/tribe, but also in the nation. Attendees will continue to work as a group, and will be joined by others to fight this disease. Sharon Smith, one of the conference organizers, said, âWe are building a national voice for positive change in youth substance abuse treatment and recovery.â

Subject: NC school of Math and Science college tuition ungrant ??

Comment: Everybody wants something for nothing right? Harrison my wonderful son is one smart guy! Everything in school even at NCSSM is effortless for him. Having the opportunity to go to a school like NCSSM is the best thing that has ever happen to him. The second best thing for us was the tuition grant. I think most kids at NCSSM have probably worked hard there hole lifeâs to get where they are now. I understand that the idea behind the grant was to try and keep these outstanding young adults living and working in NC. I can tell you with Harrison this plan would have worked. He already had pick out NCSU to continue his education. He whatâs to be a teacher of higher learning. You see with your promise he wanted to stay in NC and teach at NCSSM or NCSU. Now who knows but he probably will take the best offer thatâs presented to him. All of the kids at NCSSM have earned our support !! You really have know idea of how hard most of them have worked to get were they are now. Do you think that they will take trust in NC government again ? Probably not right?

Subject: MOVING

Comment: I think it is pretty messed up when the government can come in and take whatever they want.I found out a couple weeks ago that the highway is coming through my yard & everyone on my street has to move.I own my home & my husband & I dont have the income to rent another place or buy one.And I know that the government wont give us enough money to buy another home.My neighbor's are elderly people,and are in no shape to move.It's not fair that you all can do this to us...when we cant afford another place.Why do we have to move?I think that if you are taking our homes ,you should buy us another one.And I do stress the word buy..You have obviously never been put in this situation or you would understand!!DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT,PLEASE!!I like my home....

Subject: trouble getting my social security card changed

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I have been trying unsuccessfully for almost a month to get my social security card changed into my current married name. You see, while living in another state, my husband Jerry and I were married under the church, but did not get a state marriage certificate. I have our church marriage certificate, signed by my pastor and two witnesses; I have plenty of photos of our marriage--even a video of the same; but the Social Security people I spoke with here in Salisbury tell me that's not good enough. They said I have to have a state certificate. I am confused and disheartened by the treatment my husband and I have gotten. My driver's license--which was granted to me in my current married name by the North Carolina DMV in 2001, on the basis of my church marriage certificate and my birth certificate--expired on my birthday (March 7th), but according to the lady at the DMV, I cannot get it renewed unless I get my Social Security card changed to "Sharon D. Smith." I have been running around for almost a month trying to get the Social Security people to acknowledge my church-sanctioned marriage. I was informed by a lady at the Salisbury Social Security office on March 6th that if I could get my church marriage certificate re-issued with "biographical information" on it (I was told that my birthdate on such a re-issued document would suffice), then my church marriage certificate would be acceptable. I went through the trouble of calling my former pastor and having him create a new document with both my husband's and my birth dates on it, with the required signatures of two witnesses, etc., and then having to wait for the document to reach me. Today, my husband and I took the re-issued marriage certificate, plus other proof of who I am (birth certificate, school documents, etc.)and went to the Social Security office to get my name changed on my S.S. card. I even took some photos of our wedding, so they could see my husband and me actually getting married. But I was still refused, on the basis that I don't have a state-sanctioned document. Governor Perdue, this part of our great land is still called the Bible Belt--where God has been honored, I thought, far more than in many other parts of our country. Why then is a church-sanctioned marriage, in which two people--before a whole congregation of witnesses--pledge their lives to one another not considered legal? When did the state superceed God in matters of marriage? According to my deepest-held beliefs, marriage is an institution of God, not the state. Governor Perdue, I am not a youngster: I just turned 55, and my husband--a disabled American vet (Vietnam) is 66. We have been married since October 21, 2000. My husband is ill with multiple health problems stemming from exposure to Agent Orange while in Vietnam. I just want the privilege of sharing his surname while I still have him. I don't know how long he will live: he has heart problems, kidney problems, Type II diabetes, plus a lot of other health concerns. He's gone through a lot--even cancer. Can you help me, please? I need to be able to drive, V.A. here in Salisbury, as well as in Asheville--but I can't get my driver's license renewed without getting my Social Security card changed to "Sharon D. Smith." Right now it's in my former name, "Sharon D. Davis." If you can help me, I will be most grateful. I want to know that, in the great state of North Carolina, church-sanctioned marriages are still honored and upheld. Sincerely, Sharon D. Smith

Subject: Deadbeat Dads- What about Deadbeat Soldiers?

Comment: April 1, 2009 Dear WGHP Fox 8: I write to you this evening in search of help. I need someone to help me fight for my rights. I have been a loyal FOX 8 News supporter for as long as I can remember. I have heard my entire life about deadbeat fathers and how much they hurt their children. My question to you tonight is what about deadbeat soldiers? My story began well over a year ago when I met a man that lied and told me he was 21. I was 18. He contiued to lie and manipulate me for many months. He told me the normal stuff, that if I loved him I would spend all my time with him. Therefore I dropped out of college. He convinced me to marry him claiming that he could make a good living for us with the US Army. A short time later he began talking about how much more he could make with BAH (basic housing allowance) if we were married. He convinced me to leave home and marry him. Iâm not saying that he held a gun to my head. I made mistakes, but I trusted and loved him. After we were married I began to realize that he had lied about many things, one of which being his age. He was 25. He also lied and told me his National Guard Unit had been called up to go to Iraq. I was heartbroken. Later I found out and have documented proof in writing that he volunteered to go to Iraq in October before he married me in January. This was all a scam. A fradulent marriage and a scam to make more money from the army. He left in March of 2008, leaving me with numerous bills, alone and no source of income. Within a few weeks, he sent separation papers that he had drawn up while over there. I refused to sign them until I met with an attorney. My attorney advised me not to sign them based on several lies in the separation agreement. All lies that I have written documents to prove. He even wanted the separation to take place prior to a date that he and I spent in a hotel together before he left the country. I have hotel receipts in both our names. He planned this scam all along. I was also told by my attorney that I should contact a jag officer with the military who could look into the law. She felt that I was probably entitled to Â½ the BAH until we were divorced. She also advised me to find the deepest lake I could and throw his rings, his car keys, etc. into it. I didnât. I still tried to be civil and do the right thing. I returned his furniture, his personal items and even his car keys. I even had my parents help me take the furniture to his parents home. We loaded it ourselves. Upon contacting the legal department of the National Guard I was told I was entitled to $350 monthly to be paid on the 15th of each month. He reluctantly paid but often only after I contacted the jag officer or the legal department. Payments were almost always late and I had to worry if they would show up. After grieving for a few weeks over all this with Chris, I decided I had to go back to school and get my life back on track. I moved back home. I recommitted my life to God and worked diligently at determining what I wanted to do with my life. I decided I wanted to attend Duke University in the Ophthamalic Technician program. I knew this would be difficult. I had to pass a test, submit a portfolio and interview, knowing they would only take 12 students from the US and abroad each year. The program had been condensed into a 1 year program July to June 5 days a week @8 hours a day. The need for these technicians is great. I was accepted and took out student loans based on the fact that I would have $350 monthly from Chris. I am within 3 months of completing the program, have made great grades and have already had job offers yet I worry that I will not have enough money to finish. I count on this money because it is owed to me. I cannot hold a job while in the program due to the demands daily and amount of time spent preparing for class and completing the clinical hours required. I am getting very low in my savings account and wander if I will have the money to finish. My parents are unable to help. My dad found out in November that he has a rare degenerative disorder that has made him disabled. My mom is a school teacher. There is no extra. With my dadâs medical bills there is very little they can do to help me. I was owed $350 in January. He shorted me but promised to make up for it in February. He did not pay in February or March and now it is April. He owes me $1100. I cannot go to my attorney and divorce him until he pays all he owes. All I want is what I am owed. I will then divorce him, graduate and move on with my life. I have contacted the legal departments and they tell me to contact Lt. Col Woodlief, who has helped me in the past, but has not recently. I have left a million emails and messages. My understanding is that there are numerous cases similar to mine that keep these military attorneys so busy that they canât keep up with the backlog. Is honor really necessary to be a soldier? I have tried calling his commander Captain Layton with the Virginia National Guard but his voice mail is always full and I have not been given a call back. I do not want to drop out of school this close to finishing but if someone doesnât help me collect from this âDeadbeat Soldierâ I will have to. I appreciate anything you can do to help. Sincerely, Chelsea Ray Roach

Subject: UNC System - NCSSM Tuition Waiver

Comment: Hello Governor... My name is Ron Wyatt and my daughter is Hannah Wyatt...my family lives in Thomasville, NC. Anyhow, there is a bill that is being sponsored by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly & Swindell, Section 9.7(a), Repeal of Full NCSSM (North Carolina School of Science & Math) Tuition Grant that will greatly impact my daughter and my family financially. This bill is tremendously unfair as many of our Seniors at NCSSM have already declined college scholarships and other awards that they were offered this year, based on the fact that they did expect the tuition grant and were planning to attend one of the UNC System's Universities. My daughter is a junior this year at NCSSM and am proud to say that she is one of the brightest young minds at her age in this state and she took a leap of faith to attend NCSSM with the trade-off being the promise of the tuition grant to one of the UNC system universities after she graduates from NCSSM. Hannah would have attended Ledford High School this year and next...she held the number one ranking in her class her Freshman and Sophomore years and most likely could have graduated with that number one ranking and would have been the valedictorian of her senior class of 300 plus students. However, she chose to sacrifice that opportunity to better herself with more challenging curriculum at NC School of Science & Math and with the promise she would be rewarded with a tuition grant. Now we are being told that there is a great possibility that our state will be reneging on that promise and my daughter will get no tuition grant for the sacrifice she has made. Besides her sacrifice, my wife and I have sacrificed greatly by encouraging her with being challenged academically...to attend NCSSM to meet that challenge and we gave up watching our daughter grow up in high school and getting to be a part of all the social stuff parents get to experience during their child's high school years by allowing her to attend NCSSM with the promise the UNC System tuition grant reward would be there in the end. Governor, my wife and I are simple Davidson County folk..a middle income family...in fact, I lost my job with a company layoff several weeks ago (the 3rd time I've lost a job in 4 years) and just recently have become employed again and am picking up the pieces on the financial side of things. My daughter gave up her opportunity of academic glory at Ledford High School and the many scholarship opportunities that would have resulted from staying at Ledford to be more challenged academically and for the tuition grant and it appears she could be stuck as a result of the aforementioned bill if it passes. Hannah will not be able to go back to Ledford with the re-established #1 class ranking and a lot of her classes (course of study) at NCSSM will not transfer back to Ledford as NCSSM's curriculum is so much different than a public high school. Jerry, please do not let my daughter get left high and dry...vote against this bill...at least keep the tuition grant for those students who are currently attending NCSSM (class of 20099 and 2010). Please do not let the state break its promise to our family...our daughter who was counting on it. She made the sacrifice by acting on faith and her dreams and on this tuition waiver promise. Hannah could quite possibly be the next female governor of NC and I'm not kidding...don't let the message be sent to her that our state, our governor is not willing to live up to a promise made to her in advance of her commitment to NCSSM...please live up to the state's bargain...live up to your educational investment in her. Governor, please consider that the three main reasons that the NCSSM Tuition Grant should stay in place: Â· Based on the promise of this academic award, most of our senior families made decisions to attend UNC institutions prior to the release this budget proposal. In many cases, they declined scholarships elsewhere. For these families, especially, it is too late to make alternate plans and avoid serious financial harm. Â· Both junior and senior families have made important personal, educational and financial decisions based upon this compact, which has served as an incentive for academic achievement since their middle school years. Â· The tuition grant is symbolic of the importance placed by North Carolinians on educational excellence. These young people attending this school are the brightest of the brightest who are our future NC business, educational and government leaders. Governor, please don't let a promise be broken to our NCSSM 2009 and 2010 classes...to Hannah. It would be a travesty to rescind this tuition waiver by back dooring/blind siding our kids and us parents after making a firm commitment to us...we all have sacrificed so much on the state's promise to us that should be kept. I am placing my faith in you to do the right thing and hoping you will rally others around our cause who hold my daughter's / NCSSM students' college financial future in their hands by voting to keep the NCSSM UNC system tuition waiver in place by encouraging them to vote against the bill sponsored by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly & Swindell, Section 9.7(a), Repeal of Full NCSSM.

Hannah woud have an interest in doing a summer internship with your office this summer if you are interested. As a female, she looks up to you with great admiration. All of her community friends and teachers have stated on more than one occasion over the years that she has a bright future in politics and great things are in store for her in whatever she chooses to do in lfe...she is a tremendous intellect, public speaker and debater. Hannah's NCSSM email address is wyatth@ncssm.edu if you would like to communicate with her about her political aspirations and her fear about the NCSSM tuition waiver being rescinded.

Subject: HB 539, a Father's Perspective

Comment: Dear Gov. Perdue, I am writing in regards to House Bill 539, not as an educator, but as a father. As a high school assistant principal, I know the importance of earning an education, especially in these hard economic times. Education is the key to a successful career and a lack of such can mean the difference between candidate A or B getting a job. Also, pre-kindergarten is the first defense to prevent high school dropouts, something that my school works hard to prevent. Many of the drop outs we encounter did not attend a high quality pre-kindergarten program such as More at Four. However, I am not writing about that, but the importance of More at Four pre-kindergarten in my children's lives. Both of my children were students in a More at Four Classroom at Blount Pre-K Center in New Hanover County. My boys are now in 1st and 3rd grades, respectively, and they are at the top of their classes, earning high marks and praise from their teachers. It was the foundation and high expectations established by their More at Four teachers Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Johns that has lead to their success in school. When they both entered kindergarten, they were more than prepared and both teachers commented on how well prepared they were. Because of the streamlined curriculum between Pre-K and Kindergarten established by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, my children had a very productive and successful time in kindergarten. More at Four, under the Office of Readiness and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, have established a curriculum that ensures student success, set forth stringent and high standards for teachers, certification, and continuing education, and provides services such as early intervention, IEP's, and other services to aide and help with the educational and academic success of children. My children, my boys, are proof of that. Remember, pre-k is here to help provide a strong foundation that will ensure the long-term educational and academic success of a student. More at Four has done this!! I am asking that you vote against HB 539 and keep More at Four under the Office of Readiness and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. More at Four is about school and academic readiness and NCDPI is about education. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at 910-431-7200 or email me at jjjandbfj@hotmail.com. I thank you in advance for your continuing support of meeting the educational needs of all students in North Carolina and stopping passage of HB 539. Sincerely, Jeremiah Johnson Father of two More @ Four Graduates Assistant Principal, Heide Trask High School

Subject: I would like to ask the govenor a question

Comment: Govenor Perdue I wanted to ask you what you will be doing to help me and people like me who were victims of abduction and sexual assualts as children. I was atacked along with other children by a sex offender named Anthony Burl Utt when I was twelve years old. I was drugged and sodomized by this person. I went from a straight A honoroll student too dropping out of school haveing reaccuring nightmares and panick atacks. I am now 28 and have not been able to find any resource to help me deal with the trauma of the events that happened too me. I've searched and searched and searched to try to find help for many years. I ended up getting into trouble with the law myself because of the anger that I couldn't deal with from being molested as a child. So my question is what are you going to do to help me and others like me have resources available to be able to cope with the past and be able to look forward to a brighter future. I feel that somewhere the system failed me and now I cannot get a job because of what happened to me as a child. I applied for disablilty over two years ago because I couldn't work and be around other men without haveing a panick atacks and I've been denied disability benifits twice now and I'm still waighting for my final hearing. I wanted to be a history teacher that was my dream but now because I haven't had any help or the resources to learn to cope with being abused. I can't walk into a room of people without feeling a panic atack starting. Is there anything you can do to help me get my life back and cope with the past. Thank you for your time.

Subject: Opening ABC stores on Sunday & the cigarette tax

Comment: Does our government fail to have respect for the sabbath day? And, whose idea was it to add another 1.00 tax on cigarettes? If you need to generate revenue why don't you try adding about 10.00 - 20.00 per bottle on liquor? Alcohol has devastated our home. Smokers have been put down for years but nothing is ever done about alcohol. It is so accepted by society, its a money maker not only for the stores but in our judicial system. Our insurance premiums are high not just because of smoking but also because of obesity, alcohol, street drugs, etc. My husband has had a pending DWI since 2007 and he has gone to court every month and they tell him they just don't have time to try the case that day and so they set another date. He continues to drink and drive every day. He was in the hospital last year 10 times and the doctors just smile saying that if he doesn't want help there's nothing they can do. Tell me, what drunk with a blood alcohol level of 35 is going to tell a doctor he wants help? Nobody will force him to get help. If a person is charged with a DWI they should not be allowed to drive until their court date and it should be mandantory to try the case within 60 days. They should be forced to be in a rehab for no less than 90 days. Let me assure you that for every drunk driver that is involved in an accident there's a family in the background who has tried unsuccessfully to get help for that person. He was just in court a few weeks ago and the judge had an officer check his alcohol level. It was 36 so she placed him in jail until he sobered up. She assured me that his cases would be tried on the next court date. Well, guess what, he now has another court date for May. Quit hammering smokers and do something about the REAL addiction problems we all face every day. Shut the doors on all ABC stores. To many my story is funny. However, if you had to live it you would not touch another drop of alcohol. He has run out of options and has no money, no job and no place to live. But, he IS a human being. He used to be a pillar of the community and a very hard worker. Thank you for your time.

Comment: the education lottery was forced on the residents of nc as everyone knows under the farce of an education lottery. now this education lottery has been taken away from its children of nc. our granddaughter is in college at one of nc colleges, she is basically doing it on her on. now she doesn't even have this "education lottery" moneies to help her with her education. she is studying to be a nc teacher and should graduate spring 2010. your decision to take away the "education lottery" from the students hurt their education. our future depends on our students, please help them.

Subject: North Carolina School of Science and Math

Comment: Dear Madam Governor, I would like to ask you to please consider trying to offer the tuition grant to the students at NCSSM . I know that the state is in a financial disaster like the rest of the country but these students are some of the brightest teenagers in our state and we should invest in their future because it is ultimately our future as well. Before the tuition grant many of the students went out of state the college now I think that trend has reversed. There are many students that chose NCSSM for the tuition assistance program and they have no backup plan at this late date. Even if the plan had to be phased out over time this would be more helpful than just cutting them off with nothing. I'm sure there are those that say, "These kids are smart so they will land on their feet anyway". Please realize these 16-17 years old students left home two years early, they are on a very rigorous program academically which is so much more challenging than anything they knew at their previous school. They are dealing with life lessons as well as academics. While all this can be a good experience it is also very trying and they do diserve some type of recognition for their hard work. This school has been a model for other schools throughout the country and it is a shining light for education in North Carolina. I hope that if money cannot be provided for these students extra staff will be made available to help these deserving students find scholarships, etc. Most seniors have already made their plans for college so it would be a disgrace for a child to not be able to continue their education because the adults who offered this wonderful tuition grant are now taking it away. Sincerely, Angie Hilburger Angie's Dance Academy Parent of 2010 NCSSM Graduate

Subject: THE KILLING FIELDS OF GASTON

Comment: GASTON ANIMAL CONTROL IN DALLAS IS A HORROR SHOW OF KILLING. WORSE THAN THAT, 200 DOGS DIED, "IN THEIR KENNELS" LAST YEAR. No reasons were given. That is unnatural and each death should have been accounted for. I want to know the cause of these deaths. Many occurred on weekends. There are other reputed circumstances that need verification. When are you going to do something about this horror show? These are sick people and community in denial. But the whole country of rescuers knows what's happening. Lee Hunter is part of the problem. Don't forward it to him. Gaston failed a state inspection and it's not clear that the problems were ever rectified. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GHASTLY STATE OF AFFAIRS AT GASTON? Don't refer it to the County Commissioners. They back Reggie Horton all the way. Have you heard of the "good ole' boy" system? Do something! Dianne Channell

Subject: Carthage Police Officer Justin Garner

Comment: Again, I am Justin Garner's uncle and I have a request for the Governor. I think a call from the Governor expressing a sentiment would be very much appreciated by Justin. He is not one to ask for such a thing but, I know he would cherish a call from you. These are tough times for all here in Moore County and Justin is no exception. He was almost killed and was forced to shoot another human being and that will play with anyone's emotions. Justin is coping very well with what has happened and he was thrilled to get a call from AG Cooper the other day and I am sure he would be equally thrilled to get a call from you. Either way, good luck straightening this mess out with our economy. I sincerely hope you are able to find places to cut without cutting the funding to our small towns too much. Sincerely, William S. Garner Commissioner, Town of Pinebluff, NC And proud uncle of Officer Justin Garner If this sounds like something you would like to do, please email me at the address above or call me at (910)695-5192

Subject: A teacher arrested for selling drugs in still employed at school

Comment: I am very concerned for the safety of the students at Andrews Elementary School in Burlington, NC. A teacher was arrested for selling drugs out of her home and remains employed at the school. This is very disturbing to me and I am ashamed of our school system for allowing such. What can be done about this matter? I think the entire school may need investigating since the teacher did not receive a criminal check before hired. Please help!!!! this is the link for the news station that aired the story http://www.digtriad.com/news/features/article.aspx?storyid=120231&catid=216

Subject: Titan Cement Plant Castle Hayne

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I was most impressed with your presentation at the Education Town Hall Meeting today in Castle Hayne. It is obvious that you are capable to handle the challenges facing the state and that you are making choices from both the head and the heart. The topic of the meeting today dealt with education and I feel for the educators and the challenges that they face. I believe that "if you have a problem that money can solve, you don't have a problem". Providing experiences for a bright and healthy child might be enhanced by money, but no amount of money can make whole a child suffering the physical and mental limitations imposed by poisoning from mercury and other pollutants that will result if the Titan Cement plant is built. Please insist that adequate time be given for the state and federal agencies to review all aspects of the construction of this cement plant. The health of a large number of people could be at stake. Sincerely, Dr. Sally Buchanan
