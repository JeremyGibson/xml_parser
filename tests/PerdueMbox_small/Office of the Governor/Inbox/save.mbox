Dear L.S. Hunt:



Thank you for your recent email.  The Governor appreciates you sharing this question with her office.



The Governor’s Working Families Agenda is geared towards people who are under 200% of the federal poverty level. However, because of the policy initiatives attached to the agenda (CHIPs, EITC, minimum wage increases, housing trust fund, etc.) the agenda touches many more people that do not fall under 200%.



Sincerely,



Office of the Governor

> Gov. Perdue Presents Lawmakers with Pathway to Protecting Education, Core Services within a Balanced Budget

In a letter to lawmakers this week, Gov. Bev Perdue provided a pathway to a balanced budget that protects education and other core services. The pathway also calls upon budget writers to make significant cuts, to increase revenue through specific revenue increases and to take steps to modernize North Carolina’s tax code, including permanent reductions to sales, income and business tax rates.

> Gov. Perdue outlined the four key principles she believes are vital to a balanced and responsible budget. The pathway incorporates aspects of existing proposals, including some from her own budget and from the House and Senate. 

> “We must remember that the decisions we make today are not about our political future, they are about our children’s future,” she said.

> The letter, sent to every Senate and House member, detailed these principles:

> - Protection of education and core public safety and health care services
> - Fairness to working families
> - Modernization of the tax code with permanent rate reduction
> - Targeted tax relief

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=507>> Click here to read the complete letter and pathway to protect public education.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Executive Orders to Increase Transparency in State Government

Gov. Bev Perdue this week signed Executive Orders 17 and 18 to bring greater transparency and accountability to state government.

> “These executive orders further expand on two hallmarks of my administration – transparency and accountability,” said Perdue. “Only when the doors of government are open wide, and the sun truly shines in, can we be sure that our government by the people is working for the people.”

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=509>> Executive Order 18 declares that executive branch emails sent to and from state government accounts will be retained and archived as public records for 10 years. Executive branch employees must keep all emails they send for at least 24 hours so that those emails can be copied to backup tapes. Emails received must also be kept for 24 hours unless the email is clearly not related to state business. The order also directs ITS to develop a new email archiving system and make it available to all executive branch agencies for which it provides email services as soon as practicable. Until the new archiving system is developed, ITS will continue to keep backup tapes of emails sent to and from state government accounts. The Governor has invited all parts of state government over which she does not have direct control, including the legislative and judicial branches, to participate in this program.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=508>> Executive Order 17 directs the Department of Commerce to obtain and report the names of consultants involved in economic development projects that seek benefits from the state’s incentive programs.  Information on consulting relationships will be provided to the Secretary of Commerce, the Economic Investment Committee, and the Governor to better assist them in making conflict of interest assessments and will be retained as part of each project’s file.

> Hoke County Gets New Manufacturer, 40 Jobs

Alpla Inc., a global supplier of plastic packaging, is opening a new manufacturing facility in Raeford.  The company plans to invest $7.2 million and create 40 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $120,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina’s strong manufacturing sector is vibrant and diverse,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s forward-looking policies, skilled workforce and top business climate continue to attract growing companies of all sizes.”

> Alpla Inc., based in Austria and with operations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, provides bottles, caps and other plastic packaging products to clients globally.  Alpla recently posted annual sales of more than $3.2 billion, with more than 10,000 employees worldwide and production facilities in 34 countries.  The company, with its U.S. headquarters in Georgia, lists Unilever, Coca-Cola, Proctor & Gamble and Clorox among its clients.

> Alpla plans to open a new manufacturing facility, its first in North Carolina, on the Raeford campus of one its major clients, Unilever Corp.  The company will manufacture plastic bottles for shampoo, conditioners and body wash products.  The 40 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $32,450, not including benefits.  That is higher than the Hoke County average annual wage of $22,724.

> North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> For more information about Alpla Inc., including employment opportunities, visit <http://www.alpla.com>www.alpla.com.

Adhezion Biomedical LLC, a global provider of surgical adhesives, wound-care dressings and infection-prevention sealants, will expand in Hudson.  The company plans to invest $750,000 and create 20 new jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $40,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina is synonymous with biomedical research, development and manufacturing,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our knowledge-based workforce and top business environment ensures that this state remains attractive to innovative, growing companies like Adhezion.”

> Adhezion Biomedical, headquartered in Pennsylvania, has one manufacturing, research and development facility, located in Hudson, where seven workers are employed.

Dear «Salutation»:

The Great Smoky Mountains are a national treasure, but the Governor was unable to attend the anniversary event in the spring.  She had another speech scheduled and couldn't make both events on the same day because of the travel time. 



She will be in the western part of the state for several days this week, including attending the Great Smoky Mountains rededication ceremony on Wednesday.

Comment: Governor, Early this Spring you didn't attend the 75th Anniversaryof the Blue Ridge Parkway citing budget and travel woes for that long a trip. However, a month or so later you and members of your staffs travelled to Haywood Community College to do a seminar on how business got apply for federal stimulis funds, and now you travel to dedicate a golf course on the Cherokee Reservation. Why? Is this state still not in a budget crisis? Why couldn't the seminar at HCC have been via teleconferencing? And now this trip. Who else accompanied you and at what expense? Donald Smallwood

Thank you for responding.  I am  interested in open grants for a library, consumer credit counseling service, a classic car museum and a 4-H Agency, I have worked on several different ones for non-profits.

The Open Book lists many grants which are no longer open.  And to determine if they are current grants I could contact a non-profit about, each and every grant must be opened up to review the date.

By changing the Open Book Grants info to two categories - one listing recent grants closed, and one listing open grants, would be very helful. 

Thanks again for responding.  Patricia Jackson

Here’s an answer from OSBM.  It will need to be tweaked….









Unfortunately, there is not a single source that addresses Ms. Jackson's question regarding grants administered by state agencies. Federal grants are, of course, announced on grants.gov. Under Executive Order 4, the requirement for NCOpenBook is to report on grant and contract awards, rather than announcing grant opportunities.



I agree with Ms. Jackson that a single source of state grant opportunities would be an excellent value-added service. However, this new feature would require additional data collection from the agencies and a different Web presentation. I will take this suggestion under consideration as we move ahead with NCOpenBook improvements.



One other idea: The Foundation Center provides some grant resources on their Web site:  <http://foundationcenter.org>http://foundationcenter.org

But it is likely that Ms. Jackson is already familiar with this resource.

Hi,

He sent the same type of letter to the Gov. office on August 7 (case # 1161141) and thru Contact us and has been responded to both ways. The letter is attached.
The tort claim was investigated by the attorney general's office, and was rejected in January 2008. The man was in a wheelchair and apparently did not use the appropriate walkways provided during construction. No appeal has been filed with industrial commission. We will not be responding to him again.

I  am STILL awaiting a reply to my situation, which the Governor has avoided answering and solving. I gave her until the end of September to come up with a settlement plan, yet I have not heard back from her or anyone involved in her administration or the DOT, whom is ultimately responsible for a DISABLED MAN GETTING STRUCK BY A CAR, WHILE IN HIS WHEELCHAIR, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ADEQUATE OR OPEN SIDEWALKS FOR ME TO TRAVEL AND i WAS FORCED INTO THE STREET WHERE I WAS SRUCK BY THE VEHICLE! MY RIGHTS AS A HNDICAPPED PERSON HAVE BEN VIOLATED, I HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY  A DOT EMPLOYEE ETC ETC ALL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT TH AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT WS NOT FOLLOWED AND NO SIDEWALK WAS PASSABLE,YET THERE WERE NO SIGNS,BARRICADES,CONES ETC THAT MARKED THE SIDEWALKS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO 'ALTERNATE WALKWAY' PROVIDED AS PER FEDERAL LAW! I SUGGEST THE GOVERNOR GET OFF HER ASS AND RESOLVE THIS MATTER BY TOMMOROW AFTERNOON, BECAUSE ON THURSDAY I GO TO ALL THE NEWSPAPERS,TV STATIONS AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES! IF SHE DOESN`T BELIEVE ME, JUST WATCH AND SEE WHAT A MESS IS CAUSED FOR HER AND HER ADMINISTRTION WHEN I START SHOWING THE PICTURES AND PLAYING THE AUDIO-TAPES AND SHOWING THE FEDERAL,LOCAL AND STATE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN, NOT TO MENTION MY CIVIL RIGHTS....TRY ME!
