Raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol rather than income taxes on the wealthy?!?!

Another in a LONG line of "Democratic" SELL-OUTS.

I know you're not capable of shame but you should be.

I do not know if this will reach Gov. Perdue.  I worked at Swannanoa Juvenile Center for 16 years.  The very best program at that center was Camp Woodson.  I wish she would take it off the closing list and look at the Training School Program.  There are so few kids there and it is just not economically responsible to provide the type of counseling that is needed for these warehoused kids.  This program is just wrong.  They have given most of the campus to the women and they need to go on and give them the rest of the campus so that they can have the school for vocational classes and other life skills classes.  There are not enough teachers to provide adequate classes for the students so they can never go back to their schools.  Most of the 39 kids are really mentally sick and or hard criminals.  Nothing about their program is like it was in the past when there were multiple programs and staff with certification to address the! issues that they were dealing with.  I would strongly urge Governor Perdue to keep Camp Woodson open.  I urge her to close the Juvenile Center now instead of waiting until 2010.  Camp Woodson is a wonderful survival type program and I saw students really grow and take responsibility after they went through this great program.  It will be a great loss to Juvenile Justice if you close this program.  Betty Budd, Retired Academic Administer at Swannanoa Youth Development Center and Women Forum Member.

Governor Perdue, I am not a smoker, but I was absolutely shocked that you would ever consider a proposal to add a $1.00 tax to a pack of cigarettes.  Do you realize that decision would put thousands of people out of work in Greensboro and Winston Salem.  We are already facing terrible cut backs form Dell, and all of our manufacturing companies who are now located in India, Mexico, etc.   Please hold off on making that proposal to the State Representatives until our economy is back on plane and people are back to work. 

I have a son who was laid off from Corning in Wilmington.  He has spent the last month sending out resume, cold calling to hospitals and other businesses in the area trying to find work.  He told me Sunday if nothing came along this week, he was just going to take anything he could find to get to work. 

I have been watching your plans for the Stimulus Package NC received from President Obama, and thus far if you are not a laborer, you are completely out of luck in finding a job that the Stimulus Package was suppose to assist with.  Surely there is someone in our State Government who is creative enough to come up with jobs for the average Joe who has been working in an industry that is no more.

Thank you for taking the time to send out your updates and progress in NC.

Sincerely,
Donna Moore

I have been a teacher in the state of NC for 23 years.  I struggle to make ends meet.  I cannot afford vacations, second homes, going back to school for a higher degree, or any other luxury items or activities.  My first three years of teaching the state froze teacher salaries.  I worked evenings, weekends, and summers to make a living.  After the freeze ended my salary slowly inched up the career ladder.  As a NCAE member I have advocated higher salaries for beginning teachers.  However those of us with the greatest experience have never been adequately paid.  I am appalled that the Governor that I helped elect would freeze the one monetary bonus that I receive: my longevity pay.  I am not fooled that a 1-2% pay increase is a reward....I know that I will make less money without that longevity pay.
I am disheartened with the rhetoric I am hearing.  I have taught for 23 years out of my love and committment to children and education.  Talking about supporting public education and teachers is not good enough.  I need to see action and not an attempt at a "sleight of hand".

	Taxing tobacco and alcohol is discrimination.  And tobacco, isn't that one of NC's most profitable resources?

Governor Perdue Releases 2009-2011 Budget Proposal

Governor Bev Perdue released her FY 2009-11 budget this morning.  Despite facing the most challenging budget since the Great Depression, the budget invests in education, economic development and job creation, and public safety and it protects core services.

The budget increases per pupil spending, launches a Jobs Now initiative to train new and displaced workers, invests in economic development programs, and funds key probation, mental health, and anti-gang initiatives.

	I voted for Govenor Perdue and am very upset with the cigarette tax she is imposing.  I am a smoker and all of a sudden my cigarettes have increase  $10.00 per carton and that doesn't include her tax.  Somewhere we should have some rights.  Perhaps taxing internet users or liquor.  I will not vote for her again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

In the preparation of this budget, did you ever examine the elimination of any programs that no longer have any value? By the same token, were there any existing programs that were worthy of reduction in size because of changing conditions?
I'm afraid, that as usual the budget was prepared from a spending perspective rather than an absolute need perspective.
Your comments would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Ray

It is nice that all jobs in the government sector will be maintained, and that additional government jobs will be initiated.  No doubt, there are some government jobs that are essential.  The downside is that the more government jobs there are relative to private sector jobs, the more quickly the feed trough is empty! 
   Make strides to revitalize our states factories.  Tax products imported, that were once North Carolinas.
Do the state  a favor.  Go through the states budget(programs) line by line, and eliminate 10 percent immediately. 
Citizens with common sense, see through the tactic of targeting the most visual and needed programs in order to cause pause.  Be honest, unbiased and frank.

Get someone from the classroom, not an AG class, someone teaching middle
school not that nice little second grade.

Find out about the NC-Wise that goes down or is up for service just when
the teachers need it for their grades.

Answer that.

It seems that paying taxes is an arbitrary thing. Some people do not want to pay their taxes and therefore they do not. Are there two different sets of laws regarding taxes, one set for people who think they are special, above the law and obviously able to get away with not paying and another set of laws for honest people who pay their taxes because they know it is the right and legal thing to do?
    It seems that instead of raising taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, the state could actually enforce the law by making these non-tax payers, pay up. It is very disheartening to see that the law only applies to certain people and not others. It is also disappointing to see that enforcement of our laws is an arbitrary thing as well.

Governor Purdue: Today was St. Patrick Day with visions of Luck Of The Irish, Pot Of Gold and Corn Beef & Cabbage. Today also, my wife Heather & I witnesses a homeless man death scene in a public place with police cars and 3 policeman. One policeman put a white sheet over the motionless, sleeping homeless man and we were shocked at this tragedy! I wish that Honolulu, Hawaii wouldn't have homelessness situation and homeless man death with no family and friends around him. ALOHA, Frankie & Heather Kam

I understand what has to happen as far as the budgets are concerned but if something is not done soon people are getting desperate to keep all they have worked for and to feed their family's. I hope that someone can get some our textile work back here in the United States so people can go back to work. Also I would like for someone to check into the matter of not paying personal taxes. I owe personal taxes and because of cost of living and loss of jobs I could not pay these taxes and now the state is issuing a garnishment and I seen a man on tv that holds an office and owes millions and no garnishment there, now you tell me why this is fair. I would like to contacted by someone in this office that can help me with this matter. My garnishment will start by the end of the month and I would like to get something from your office directing the state to give me  another payment arrangement now that I am working and stop this garnishment. I think that the working class people have had enough hard luck. This man in Alamance County is no better to pay his taxes than me. Please have someone to reply soon. I hope that I do not have to go to the news to find out why we can get no help from our goverment. Looking forward to hearing from you. 




Sincerely: 

Peggy J Johnson

Thank you for this email.  I would like to offer my support for the sin tax you are proposing.  These are luxuries we can do without.
I also would like to know if anything has been done with regards to the recent trip by government employees, spouses and children to Wilmington at taxpayers' expense.

My name is Matt Collogan and I'm an educator for New Hanover County in Wilmington. I am writing to voice my disgust for the elimination of the Office of Environmental Education. Of all things to cut back on, education of our natural resources should never be comprimised. Without the environment we have nothing. Without educating NC's young minds about the state's natural heritage, we are paving the way for for a dark future indeed. Please take this note as public opinion against the elimination of our wonderful Office of Environmental Education. How can you say your budget stresses education when you remove the most effective type of education this state provides? It's time to prioritize the things that are important, and environmental education is an essential part of the economy, culture, and future of this great state. Please continue to fund the Office of Environmental Education.

I am truly upset.  I voted for you and was shocked that you want to add another tax to cigarettes & alcohol.  Please remember that RJ Reynolds employs thousands of people and has donated land to Wake Forest University and to many other institutions.  I thought you were a Democrat but it seems you are leaning more to the Republican mindset.

Disappointed,  Inez Linville, retired attorney & former Wake Forest student

Print is so small cannot read,  Thanks for the effort.  I think we need to think again about the cigarette tax.  I am a non smoker however  These Tobacco Companies have contributed  an anormous impact on our economy.  I surely would be saddened  to see those companies  leave for China, or India, or where ever.  Tax on alcoholic beverages  should start with Beer and Wine since no increase  on those beverages has occurred in several years.

I have a suggestion as to how to save some money on Medicaid/
Eliminate the "Be Smart" program.
This program gives very limited benefits and the same benefits are
available at the local health departments that the state is already
providing.

A more sensible program would be to help pay insurance premiums for
working individual that say they can not afford to pay for the medical
coverage for their families thru their employer's health insurance
plan.  I work in Medicaid and I hear this every day from people.  If
everyone took the health plans offered by their employers then
everyone elses insurance premiums would decrease because more people
would be carrying their own insurance.  It could be set up by income
and percentages of the premiums.

We should also stop paying for immigrants to have their babies.  It
they are not here legally they should not be eligible for their
hospital bills to be paid and just because they are born here they
should not automatically become a US citizen.  We could also
eliminate the payment of these hugh hospital bills that illegal
immigants create who have no insurance, no income, no work history but
get into an accident or get really sick and then Medicaid has to pay
their bills.

We should help our own citizens and disabled and aged first amd
foremost.  Do you even know that most senior citizens are only
eligible for $14.00 in food stamps per months. They have worked and
have paid for their home then they get limited assistance but if you
have not worked and had babies you get hundreds of dollars in food
assistance.  The whole program for Medicaid and Food and Nutrition
should be looked at by someone other than whoever dreams up these
programs.

I know everyone is facing hard times now and we are really seeing an
increase in the people asking for assistance from Social Services for
food, heating assistance, medical coverage, etc.  So many people are
losing their jobs in our area that it is really scary.  This is just
some thoughts I have.  You have my prayers and wishes that you can
make things work out for all of us.

Governor Perdue Releases 2009-2011 Budget Proposal

Governor Bev Perdue released her FY 2009-11 budget this morning.  Despite facing the most challenging budget since the Great Depression, the budget invests in education, economic development and job creation, and public safety and it protects core services.

The budget increases per pupil spending, launches a Jobs Now initiative to train new and displaced workers, invests in economic development programs, and funds key probation, mental health, and anti-gang initiatives.

I have been taking care of my mother for the past 9 or 10 years.  Now she has passed away last month and the reverse mortgage people say I have six months to vacate my home.  Is there anything I can do to go on staying here.

New Governor Perdue:  How could you possibly spend all that money on a race track????   When we have so many bridges,  etc.,  that need help and repair before they collapse and kill many people.  Are you pacifying a sport audience?  If so,  why?  I am not a racing fan,  I watch it sometimes on the news and am horrified by the accidents which kill and wound men all the time.  Why are you subsidizing and continuing this horror?   Gay Cheney,  constituent
