First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.


Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.
