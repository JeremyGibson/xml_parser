I worked for Mrs. Perdue during the campaign and would like to continue to offer my services as a volunteer, committee member, etc.  I am a retired principal from Harnett County with 36 and 1/2 years of service to our state in education.  Please let me know what I can do to help or assist the Governor.

Bev:

We understand these are very rough times and not an easy task for you to accomplish.  Still, we know your recent decisions to overcome (partially) our troubled economy have been rightfully targeted.  North Carolinians have high hopes and faith in your determination to bring our State to its proper navigational course (North).  For this same reason, you have our complete support in your endeavors as Governor.  

Thanks for keeping us informed.

I am impressed with the Governor’s use of the internet as a communication tool.  She is doing a great job of showing accountability and transparency.  These are trying times and I was honestly afraid that it would be the NC good old boys type of government.  I have been very pleased thus far.

 Dear Governor Perdue : I played a major part in your campaign to become Governor, appointed to your Steering and Finance Committee enable me to garner support from those during uncertain times. Supporters gave to the Perdue Campaign, because they believed Bev Perdue will be honest and fair to her supporters and Citizens around the State. They believe the intergrity on Bev's part would justify the basic meaning of her office as Governor. Meeting with Bev during fund-raising gathering and private settings for giving, gave people a sense of openness and support, and there believing in me as a representative of her ( Governor Bev Perdue ), many times I met with Bev, and she whisper into my ear, and said , and I quote ( I don't for get ), and said to my supporters at private fundraising meetings, that Mr. Thomas Burt, will have a role in my administration, I enlight her about minority business and their issues of not recieving a fair part of contractual opportunity in State Goverment. The Governor also met with a State wide group, The Negro Master Barbers Association, who supported her, through my direction, and the Governor, vowed to the organization that she would make sure that I would have a place in her administration. I also played a Major role in Bev's GOTV efforts in Wake County, by working directly with Kay Gattis, and assisted Michael Hayden with fund-raising events, and I put funds in Bev's hand. I submitted my resume and quarlifications to the Transition Office as directed, only confirmation of recieving was given. No one has contact me or interviewed me for any consideration.

I would like to schedule a meeting with the Governor or The Chief of Staff ( Zack Ambro's) to discuss opportunity with The Perdue Administration. Also State wide organization ( The Negro Master Barber Associations ) and those who have giving on my behalf to Bev are requesting a meeting as well, I will be in attendance representing there concerns. Your urgent attension is requested.

Thanks for the updates on the Governor's activities.  I think she has already capped the previous.

An observation.  The Governor left the parade reviewing stand before all the participants had approached the stand thus leaving many to wonder why.  They had practiced long and hard and were excited about performing for the Governor.  Among this group was the Broughton Band and I noticed that someone wrote a Letter to the Editor of the N&O about this.  Wonder if she could offer an apology to these groups?

I am thankful, humbled and impressed as not like before to have my Governor report to me ( a faithful servant) the actions she has taken to care for our state.  I feel connected and hopeful.

During the inaugration on January 10, I was disappointed that  pledge to the North Carolina Flag was not used.  At every meeting of the Woman's Club of Raleigh we have the pledge to the Flag of North Carolina.

Well, we now have a Governor who is "REALLY 'SOMETHING!" That
"Something" may actually be Salvation for North Carolina! I say "may"
because it seems too good to be true insofar as the participants needed
are concerned. One woman, even a miracle one like Beverly Perdue, can't
do it all by herself. I do feel, though, that the needed "participants"
will be so overwhelmed by the possibilities being presented just won't
be able to do anything other than participate fully in these endeavors.
BRAVO!

Hello,



I just wanted to say thank you for sending out this update.  I have not seen this kind of information from the Governor’s office disseminated before, and I found it to be informative and interesting.  I hope regular updates like this will continue to be sent out.  It sets a good example for other public office holders to follow.  It gives me another reason to be glad I voted for Governor Perdue. 

Respectfully,

I would hope that the governor has on her agenda a bill to freeze property taxes on all seniors in the state of North Carolina. My property taxes have increased 250% in the last five years. Up seventeen hundred dollars last year. Your help is needed and you indicated this was a key issue during your campaign. I hope this does make it to Mrs. Purdue.   Ron Ramirez

Dear Bev:

You have had a very busy week....and a good one for NC.
 I enjoyed going on line to see all the inaugural parties and celebrations. You look like you are happy in your role. What a delight!! Your husband must be a treasure!!

Just FYI. CA Lloyd is my uncle. Harvey and Judy Hardison are good friends. When your son Garrett first came with his wife April to our UMC at Riverdale, I told him he was in dangerous territory of Republicans...and I was a lone friend!! HA!! Boy, did we convert a lot of folks getting you elected governor!!

Good luck and many prayers,
Arleen Mullen

The First Week

The first week for the Perdue Administration has been a busy and productive one.  Here is a rundown of what’s happened.



Saturday



* Bev Perdue was inaugurated as North Carolina’s 73rd governor; she attended the Inaugural Parade and held an open house at the Executive Mansion.  In addition, she launched her new official website, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>http://www.governor.state.nc.us/.


Monday



* As the first order of business as Governor, Bev Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>a series of change orders during a ceremony in her office.  Those executive orders will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.


* Governor Perdue’s 10 cabinet secretaries were sworn-in in a ceremony in the Old State House Chamber.  Governor Perdue again pledged that she has high expectations for her appointees that they need to be hands-on leaders and are accountable to the public.


Tuesday



* Governor Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=17>an executive order that outlined emergency steps to address the increasing budget shortfall.


Wednesday



* Governor Perdue traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and President-elect Obama’s transition.  Governor Perdue urged quick passage of a federal stimulus and recovery package.  She also released <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=19>a list of shovel-ready projects that will get people to work.


Thursday



* The Office of State Management and Budget estimated a budget shortfall of approximately $2 billion.  To help meet that challenge, Governor Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=22>an executive order that called for a reduction in state agency budgets and freezes on hiring, state purchases on goods and services and limits on travel.  Importantly, Governor Perdue placed an emphasis on protecting vital services such as education, health care and public safety.


Friday



* Governor Perdue spoke at the 28th annual State Employees’ Martin Luther King Jr. Observance Day program.  She reminded those in attendance that we should follow Dr. King’s example of service to others, especially in these tough economic times.

we have some families homes in Foreclosure  because taxes cannot be paid within a specific time limit and some are about to go into Foreclosure.  I am grateful for the hope you have given me and thanks for your family picture.  I am Belle McGee Frye
I ould like to send a copy of my "All Abouy Us" Book of Poetry, i think Your Grand or Great-Grandmother would enjoy it.

I want to thank Governor Perdue for sending these updates. As a taxpayer, a supporter of hers and a State Employee this represents something very different from the the past and it is very welcomed!

It was very encouraging to see the Governor showing appreciation to the DOT on behalf of those of us in North Carolina who were safely able to make it to work because of their hard work.  Thank you Governor Perdue for braving the cold:)

Sincerely,
Law Offices of Paul A. Suhr

To whom it may concern:

            This email service to the public is a great idea and I appreciate being on the mailing list …. Now if it can just keep from becoming trite and mannered, even it is promulgated to serve the
Governor’s agenda and employed for self-serving reasons, I have no problem with these things one bit. “Good work” to someone for thinking of this way to disseminate the Governor’s voice and activities.  

            Thank you,

John parker
