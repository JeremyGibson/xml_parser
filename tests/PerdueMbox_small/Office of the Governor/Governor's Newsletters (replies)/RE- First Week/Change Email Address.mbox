The First Week

The first week for the Perdue Administration has been a busy and productive one.  Here is a rundown of what’s happened.



Saturday



* Bev Perdue was inaugurated as North Carolina’s 73rd governor; she attended the Inaugural Parade and held an open house at the Executive Mansion.  In addition, she launched her new official website, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>http://www.governor.state.nc.us/.


Monday



* As the first order of business as Governor, Bev Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>a series of change orders during a ceremony in her office.  Those executive orders will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.


* Governor Perdue’s 10 cabinet secretaries were sworn-in in a ceremony in the Old State House Chamber.  Governor Perdue again pledged that she has high expectations for her appointees that they need to be hands-on leaders and are accountable to the public.


Tuesday



* Governor Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=17>an executive order that outlined emergency steps to address the increasing budget shortfall.


Wednesday



* Governor Perdue traveled to Washington, DC to meet with North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and President-elect Obama’s transition.  Governor Perdue urged quick passage of a federal stimulus and recovery package.  She also released <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=19>a list of shovel-ready projects that will get people to work.


Thursday



* The Office of State Management and Budget estimated a budget shortfall of approximately $2 billion.  To help meet that challenge, Governor Perdue signed <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=22>an executive order that called for a reduction in state agency budgets and freezes on hiring, state purchases on goods and services and limits on travel.  Importantly, Governor Perdue placed an emphasis on protecting vital services such as education, health care and public safety.


Friday



* Governor Perdue spoke at the 28th annual State Employees’ Martin Luther King Jr. Observance Day program.  She reminded those in attendance that we should follow Dr. King’s example of service to others, especially in these tough economic times.
