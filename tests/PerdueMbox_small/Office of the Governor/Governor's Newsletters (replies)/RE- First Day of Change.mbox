First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.



Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Governor,

I still seriously think your new administration should carefully consider my idea for a coordinator of financial programs for new and expanding or relocating companies considering NC. With attrition, no additional staff would be needed and it is an extremely effective way to attract great employers to NC.

Thanks for keeping me on the list.

Don Stewart

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue..  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.



Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Congratulations Governor Perdue on the constructive changes you have initiated.  I was impressed with your abilities several years ago and voted for you and now am happy to see that I had good judgement as well.  I reside in Macon County in Western North Carolina and am involved in many volunteer government efforts to make Macon County a better , a place where folks will not feel left out of the governmental process.  As democrats we are also out gunned 6 to 4 in the voting department but you bring a fresh wind to the political environment.  One of change, candor and transparency....the mountain folks are a skeptical lot though so I am propossing that if you find it in your ability to come out here to conduct a town hall we will invite folks from all surrounding counties to listen to your down to earth communications and perhaps your visit will set the tone for positive change. Whatever your decision, we wish you well....it will be a tough 4 years.  Best Regards, Larry Stenger, Macon County.

Hello and thank you for the email.
First I would like to congradulate you, Governor, on you new well earned position with our state.
Second, I am confident that you will do the best for our state and the people you have vowed to serve.
Finally, I would like to know if you will continue with any of the business that our former governor had started.  I am concerned about the request for a Pardon for my son so that he would be able to continue with our family's tradition of military service.  The following is provided: Jeffrey McFadden, #0788641


Dear Govenor,
My family comes from a long history of Army Veterans.  My Maternal Grand-father, Father, Father-in-law (deceased), ex-husband, and I have all served some time in our United States Army.  I served seven years as a Medical Specialist/Nursing Assistant/EMT, SSG/E-6.  
We moved to North Carolina in 1998 after I left the service. All three of my  sons attended Eastern Guilford High School, then went on to get their GEDs. My oldest son,(Troy-24), even enlisted in the Army National Guard. He failed to make the weekend drills every month and thus was discharged/released. Now he wishes that he was able to join the US (Regular) Army. My youngest son (Jevaun-20)is more interested in going to college. I would like my son, Jeffrey McFadden (21) (22), to be able to serve in the US Army.  However, he is currently serving prison time at the Dan River Prison Work Farm.  (Lexington 2009)
I want this war to come to a favorable end for the United States just like any other American.  If given the chance , I am sure my sons would make all of us proud. I would even reenlist for a Buddy Program, if the Army still has that option.
I would love to talk with you, Govenor, or someone on your staff regarding this matter.
You may reach me at (336)987-1579.  Thank you for all of you'all's time and consideration of this matter.
Contact the Governor's Office
  You may contact the Governor's Office by sending a letter to Governor Easley,
by e-mailing the Governor's Office or by calling the Governor's Office at:
    1-800-662-7952 valid in North Carolina only
    (919)733-4240, or (919)733-5811.

Thank you so very much. I agree one hundred percent with the changes that
 you have made. Our federal government is full of officials with dual membership
and I think we should be sure our government is being led by people who are
North Carolinians. As an example Michael Chertoff controls the FEMA program.
That pretty much says he controls the programs that are used to clean up and
repair major storm damage and he also is involved too much in issues where
the Corps of Engineers is involved. I know there is a lot of waste when they take
charge of storm clean up. And I am talking about NC, not Louisiana.
I would like to see our Governor push for more local control when we have issues
like storm damage regardless to the type storm is involved. One of the best programs
we have in our state is the program Governor Hunt started which uses prisoners to
assist in storm clean up and other things like repairing schools. In these times
with the economics being as they are we need to utilize all sources of help we
have available.
Again Thanks, Thurston

Congratulations on your first day in office. I'm excited about your appointment to serve the citizens of North Carolina. I am also interested in being a part of the reform for North Carolina as a concerned citizen. Any committees you form that include the public voice or iinvolvement I would like to be a part of especially nursing home reform.

Again congratulations.
Ms. Vernell Gore

Congratulations.



Thank you for all you did for the Veterans of NC as Lt Governor and I wish you success as Governor. 



Will you be attending the North Carolina National Guard Association Convention this year?  If so I hope you will stop by The American Legion Information Booth again this year.

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.



Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Governor Perdue,



Congratulations.



This is Michael A. Reott, Sr, DDS, PA, LTC(ret) NCNG.  We have met the past two years at the North Carolina National Guard Association’s (NCNGA) Convention; I have been manning the North Carolina American Legion Information Booth and working with The Legion Riders.  This past year at Wilmington you came over to our booth on the Convention’s Vendors floor and we presented you a picture with The Legion Riders and the Motorcycle from the previous year’s NCNGA Convention in Charlotte (see the two attachments above).   You told us at that time that you would like to have The Legion Riders as part of your escort to the Governor’s Mansion.  I have not been able to reach you and, as such, we have missed that opportunity.



I hope this email makes it up the “Chain of Command” and to your desk.  If it does and you receive this email and the pictures above please contact me if The Legion Riders can be of assistance.  Should this email not make it then I will look forward to seeing you at this year’s North Carolina National Guard Association Convention in Asheville (in March) and maybe we can discuss possibilities at that time.



Thank you for all you have done over the years for the Veterans as Lt. Governor for the great state of North Carolina. Again congratulations and I wish you the best during your “tour of duty” as Governor. 



Michael A. Reott, Sr, DDS, PA, LTC(ret) NCNG

As a citizen of North Carolina and a supporter of Governor Perdue, it makes me feel very proud to see this list.  I love North Carolina and have not felt happy to read about some of the things that have happened in Raleigh during the past few years.  I look forward to feeling proud of our great State once again. 

Perhaps changes for the mental health system are already underway.  If not I would certainly suggest that as a priority.  I served on a local board during the time that the supposed "reform" took place and was appalled at how the State handled that situation.

Best wishes from the little town of Grover, NC!

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.

As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:
1. Governorâ€™s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.
1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business â€“ putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.
1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.
1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.
1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.

Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

I know that the Governor is very,very busy at this time but if she could look into the current annexation laws and see just how unfair they are,hopefully she will support some kind of change. As a possible victim of a city forced annexation,I'm against it.At the very least residents need some say so in this matter.Thanks for your time.

Hello,
My name is Sandy Zimmerman and I am the Constituent Services Representative for Congressman Heath Shuler, Murphy Office.

I'm sure you have a press package that includes contact info for the local newspapers and I would appreciate having a copy.  My office serves Cherokee, Clay and Graham Counties and I frequently get calls about contacting the Governor & Senate offices from folks who do not have internet and can only write or call for info or assistence. Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated and you can e-mail to <mailto:sandyzimmerman@mail.house.gov>sandyzimmerman@mail.house.gov

Thank you and I look forward to your leadership and all of us working together for North Carolina and our Country.

Sandy

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governor’s Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business – putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.



Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

	This is awesome!  Brava!  I admire Governor Perdue for allowing no time to pass after taking office to begin creating and actually setting an example for an open and informative policy with regard to NC's government's operations. I, and I beleive most residents of the State, welcome it and appreciate her effort.

Thank you! I welcome being informed of decisions that impact the wonderful state of North Carolina.



As a registered nurse and nursing faculty  at one of our state universities, North Carolina Central University, I know it is imperative to remain current of health, economic and political issues locally, regionally and nationally that affect our lives.



Let me know how I can continue to help. I was one of the nurse supporters for Perdue for Governor.



Again, my congratulatory blessings are extended to Governor Perdue and her Cabinet!
