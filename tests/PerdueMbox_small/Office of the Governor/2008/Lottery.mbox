Alice,

Thank you for responding to my e-mail to the Governor's Office.  Not knowing the web site address for the NC Lottery, I like most people asked "Google" to find it, and they came up with <http://www.nc-educationlottery.com>www.nc-educationlottery.com .  This web site is highly commercialized and gives the appearance that it is the NC State Lottery web site.  As you must know, there is a big difference in your web site and the one that pretends to be the NC State Lottery web site.  I strongly recommend you attempt to educate the NC Residents about these commercial fake web sites, and promote your web site via TV and Radio.



Keep up the good work, and please forward this e-mail to the Governor's Office, in response to my original e-mail and comments.
