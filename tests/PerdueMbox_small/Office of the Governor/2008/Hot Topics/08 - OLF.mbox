> Governor Easley,
We are building our dream retirement home in Shiloh on the river.  This has been in the making for over five years.  The thought of a landing field disturbing this beautiful environment is heartbreaking.  The wildlife is truly amazing, and it should be allowed to continue undisturbed.
> Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.
> Sincerely,
Rhonda and Carl Wesley
