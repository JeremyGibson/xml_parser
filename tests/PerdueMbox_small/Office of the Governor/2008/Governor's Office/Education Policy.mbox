Mr. Fisher, the Governor does not have any authority over personnel matters within the Community College System.

We are sorry that we cannot be of assistance to you in this matter.

> I was recently terminated halfway through my contract at Wake Tech Community College. My supervisor was completely unreasonable in every way. In wake of my termination, I have received two offers of part time employment, but I will be working part time and my family and I have lost our health insurance. I have spoken to the head of the American Association of University Professors and she believes that my grievance is legitimate.
> I am following the appropriate channels of grievance at Wake Tech, but they have taken preemptive action by terminating my contract in December. The termination was based on two classroom observations by the same individual (and positive progress was stated in the second evaluation.) I am an experienced professional with a Master's degree from Chapel Hill in the Teaching of Spanish. I have attached my resume.
> I hope that (as a fellow NCCU Eagle) you will look in to this matter.
> Thanks,
> Karl
