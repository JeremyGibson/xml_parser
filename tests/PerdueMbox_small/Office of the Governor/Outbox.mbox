[Judges-on-Trial] 005:  Status of Disbarments 
.
Still no response from the NC Judicial Standards Commission regarding my Complaint filed in November 2008.  No indication of which and how many Judges, from Superior to Appellate level, are involved in this Complaint.
.
No response from the NC State Bar about multiple disbarments of all Judges and Lawyers either named in or stonewalling the JSC Complaint.
.
And now, my apology:  Back at Edition 003, I transposed the name of the Judicial Standards Commission to Judicial Review Commission and have used it ever since.  I guess I was thinking they had the Power to Review what corrupt Judges did and to take corrective action. Nothing could be further from the truth.  This Commission is paid with tax dollars to set Standards for Judges, of which their are none.  That's why the JSC Executive Director cannot tell me when the next meeting is:  they don't meet!  They just collect their paychecks, and no one cares. Why would they set Standards for their corrupt Judge Buddies?  If you set Standards, someone might want to enforce them. Perish the thought!
.
Now that that's understood, let's get back to Disbarring a few lawyers.

A further examination of the Email Bombing Documents of Raleigh Lawyer Lisa Grafstein -- which Raleigh Lawyer Paul Ross has been trying to cover up these many months -- discloses a curious circumstance.
.
Clearly, both by repeatedly sending as many as 500 Original Copies of her Email threats, and by her language contained in the written threats, Grafstein fully intended to flood my Computer with hundreds of Email messages, rendering my meager Computer incapacitated for an indefinite period of time, if not permanently damaged.
.
However, apparently Grafstein had little understanding of how computers worked in 2006, and had learned nothing more when she launched her second Email Bombing Spree in 2008.
.
Grafstein thought she sent 500 separate Emails. What she actually did was to send ONE Email, to the same address, which she typed in 500 times.
.
That's why no one noticed her handiwork. The recipient computer INBOX contained only ONE Email at the time of each of her intended Email Bombings. True enough, printing the Email would consume 13 pages for single spaced addresses, because all 500 would appear, writ large.
.
Nonetheless, Grafstein's intent to cause harm was there.  She meant to send 500 Separate Emails. And for two years, Grafstein believed she had been so successful in her original Email Bombing Spree, that she decided to try it all over again in 2008.
.
The fact that Grafstein is too dumb to understand how a computer works, or how to successfully send 500 Emails, is totally irrelevant. Her intent to do harm, as evidenced by her written threats, and her 2-year dedication to Serial Email Bombing to resolve her issues -- when simply hitting her Delete Key would have worked admirably -- all serve to convict her.
.
She loaded her gun, aimed it at me and repeatedly fired.  The fact that she did not have sense enough to use the gun properly only means that I'm still alive.  But it was clearly her intent to do me in.
.
So maybe the State Bar should disbar her for only 5 years, instead of for life?  Perhaps that would be long enough for Ms Grafstein to pass a course about how computers work, given her extraordinarily slow learning curve.  Are they really sure she passed the Bar Exam?

Unless there comes some Earth shaking event at JSC or the Bar, I'm switching back to my original quest, the one this expedition was a Test Case for:  In the name of the State of NC, three years ago anonymous Judges and Lawyers in Rockingham County stole everything I owned, including all business and personal property, and the State has made no attempt to return even one single item at any time since.
My previous experience with the State Bar is that you get notice of receipt of your Complaint, and then a month or two later they tell you they're NOT interested in doing the job taxpayers pay them to do: to protect citizens from unscrupulous Lawyers.
.
I expected similar treatment at the Judicial Standards Commission, since it's primary purpose is to protect Judges, as the State Bar's Prime Directive is to protect Lawyers.
.
But the JSC has done the State Bar one better.  JSC doesn't even pretend to do it's job. 
.
JSC doesn't bother to answer you at all.

Originally I claimed that Rockingham County had the most corrupted Judicial System in our Nation.  I think it may be time to revise that claim. 
.
The State of North Carolina has successfully challenged Rockingham County for the Title.

FLASH!  In response to Edition 004, another Raleigh Lawyer -- apparently wanting to join in on Lisa and Paul's fun -- Emailed his own set of threats.  I spent Easter afternoon writing a careful Response to him, and sent copies to the NC AG and State Bar.  He replied on Monday, denying what he had written, and lied to both the AG and State Bar by Emailing them a copy.  A lawyer once told me that a lawyer should never try to defend him/herself:  she/he should hire a lawyer.  Appears that's a good idea.  While his life as a Lawyer is coming to an end, this nut-case will have to que up: there are Complaints in line ahead of him, and no one is paying me to service his foolishness.

Footnote to Gov Bev:  On April 7th you appointed a new District Attorney to replace a retiring DA in Halifax County. You need to do the same in Rockingham County. Only, someone needs to convince Phil Berger Jr to retire before he is sent to prison. Who has the authority to do that, Madame Governor?  It's going to be a real mess to set up a Review Commission to look at every case Phil ever tried, isn't it?  Is that why you're hesitating?

[ Disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer.  I cannot afford a lawyer, am not represented by a lawyer, and live in poverty because everything I once owned in NC, including all of my personal and business property, was stolen by corrupt Judges and Lawyers of the Rockingham County Judicial System in July 2006. As of this posting, none has been returned, and no one has been prosecuted. Alternatively, I became a wordsmith Internet journalist, working to expose corruption within agencies of public trust. Previous Editions and additional evidence will be posted on a Website when I can afford to do so.
