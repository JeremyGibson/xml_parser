Subject: Balanced Budgets and Real Solutions to Saving Money

Comment: I'm unhappy with the pay cut for teachers especially on the heels of you hiring a CEO for DPI when we have an elected official who is also getting paid for the same job. This isn't to say you shouldn't make some education cuts. For example, you should force the 13 city school systems to merge with their counties like Clinton City Schools and Sampson County Schools. Having two school systems in one county is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Second, you should shorten the school year for schools who have already given their end of grade exams. Middle schools across the state will be glorified babysitters from May 20 to June 9th, because students have completed their EOG tests. Let these students go home and close the schools, this will save millions. Sincerely, Charles Bowden

Subject: Question

Comment: An investigation should be launched into what exactly the State is funding and the State should have to show that program or purchase was "necessary" before expecting underpaid State workers to have to help balance the NC State budget. Afterall, State workers are not the only people living in NC! For instance, is it really NECESSARY to pay a CEO of education a 6 figure salary when NC elected a Dept of Education Superintendant which the State pays to do this job? Does NC REALLY need to purchase Grandfather Mountain from the private owner? Why after all these years does the State NEED to own a mountain? Governor Easley stated in an N&O article in 2008 that Nascar was one of NC's biggest sports & we are in danger of losing it if the State doesn't step in, so he was planning to fund Nascar. Is NC funding Nascar? If so, I think all of these decisions represent poor ones by the Governor & others in charge of keeping our State budget balanced. The waste needs to stop! You are looking more and more like a one termer every day.

Subject: proposed house budget

Comment: Dear Governor, I realize that you are all trying your best to create a balanced budget. Unfortunately, the most recent suggestions for the budget are a complete nightmare for our children and teachers from early childhood all the way through college. I am currently an Exceptional Children's teacher in the Mountain Region with 12 years of experience and licensed in 3 states. The cuts you are proposing will leave me with very few choices. I will be able to choose between paying my student loan bill, getting groceries, or seeing the doctor (now that the state health plan costs have also risen for us). The other choice I have is to stay and teach in North Carolina or to teach in another state. Considering a factory is coming in with starting salaries at more than I make after 12 years of teaching, it seems like my representatives are making the choice for me. My reviews have always been excellent. So, perhaps Tenessee or Virginia needs an excellent Special Education Teacher...at least there I might feel valued. I am less motivated daily by the suggestions that come from my representatives. Please feel free to come spend a day in my classroom and see if you really want to lose teachers. By the way, I volunteered for this job after two teachers walked out of it midway through the prior year. I arrive at school at 6:45 every day and work till 4:30 or later usually, with 1 hour for planning and lunch. One last point, please do not say you are for education or for children and then create a budget that cuts teachers, assistants, programs, and salaries. We are not the same people teaching that were here twenty years ago. We would like to be shown some respect and dignity. As representatives, the first thing I might suggest is to look at cutting your own salaries by double the amount you suggest cutting others. Even with a 5% cut I doubt you will have to make the choice between paying your bills and eating or seeing a doctor.

Subject: North Carolina Budget

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, I am a 10th grade student at Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem. I am writing you because I believe I have an idea to solve the budget problem. I think instead of making all these budget cuts by cutting teacher jobs, cutting educational programs, cutting salaries for state employees, etc. there is a better answer. I believe all this could be solved by revising the North Carolina Constitution. It is my understanding that the N.C. Constitution is not allowed to have a deficit, and has to have a balanced or surplus budget at all times. If the Constitution was revised and changed to be allowed to have some sort of deficit to a certain extent, the teacher cuts and all the other cuts the state is would be solved. If the Constitution was revised and allowed to have a budget deficit for a limited time period until the economy was stable again it would greater benefit North Carolina as a whole. The state is going to end up paying for all these cuts in the long run with the unemployment taxes anyway, so why not keep these teachers jobs and stop making cuts throughout the state. Not to mention if the teacher’s jobs are cut then the students will no longer be educated as well as needed because the class sizes will continue to grow larger and larger. When class sizes are larger then the students do not get the full attention that is needed to learn the curriculum being taught. Also if the students aren’t being educated well enough then no new industries will want to be located in North Carolina because of the lack of education in the human resource. The cuts are only going to cause more problems for North Carolina. Thank you, Hunter Somerville Mount Tabor High School

It's a request to enact alternatives to the proposed program cuts. The current proposals to balance the state budget with cuts alone would devastate North Carolina's economy, communities, and families. Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Kim Jones

Comment: My grandson Jason Clark is a patient and has been told all trips which is the only thing they look forward to has been canceled by cut backs, I am very upset by this action. Can't you please reconsider this. Surely there is something else you can cut back on, these young people need some kind of entertainment, they looked forward to going to Walmart every Wednesday and now can't go because of using the state vehicle. any outings are cut back. That is absolutely disappointing to these young people. Respectfully, Doris Woodruff

As you know - at Senior PharmAssist, we work with older adults with limited incomes who struggle to remain independent in their homes. Some of the cuts that the House is proposing will devastate many isolated and frail older adults in Durham - and across the State (including younger individuals who cannot live indepedently). I believe, that in the longer run - these cuts will, in fact, cost us MORE. This cost will be seen in terms of increased healthcare utilization and in terms of incredible personal hardship and suffering. While we believe in running "tight ships," and stretching precious healthcare and service dollars (and know that there are ways to trim Medicaid spending, for example) please consider continuing to invest in programs that help seniors and people with disabilities keep their dignity. We encourage you to work together in the NCGA to think more strategically about raising revenues that others have suggested as a means of balancing a very bad budget and keeping that human services infrastructure in place. We appreciate your service to our State!! Sincerely, Gina Upchurch 9196824962

I have a tough job too. I am a PhD in Psychology but it did not help me find any services for my mentally ill son , with childhood onset bipolar disorder in 2006. After struggling to help him for 22 years, we had to send him to Mississippi to a private program to save his life, as there were no services available in this area in Raleigh, our capital , to help him. He almost died here, and they saved his life there. he still lives there so he can get follow up care and most of the time he is doing great. Of course, we rarely see him as he lives so far away and we spent many thousands of dollars on his treatment and we still support him. now, if in 2006, I could not find any help for him, me being a Psychologist, how can we possibly cut funds for already inadequate services? It makes me despondent just to comtemplate it. I was hoping some day he could come back, but that day will never come if we do not improve services in this state. I have lived here and loved the state (for the most part ) for 26 years. I beg you to raise taxes before you even consider cutting back on services for mental health, developmental disabilites and substance abuse. These are all treatable conditions and people deserve a chance to have a life. My son can work at a job and go to school with the right support. So why can't he do that here? Sometimes I really do not understand. My story is just mutipled by hundreds maybe thousands of families where we try to do the best for our family and friends and when we come up empty, there are no words to express the pain that this causes - not just for the patient , but for every family member and friend he or she has. The loss to society is great as most of these people can go on and live a productive life is they get the right treatment. Please add to, do not subtract funding for these programs, as a mother I beg you and as a citizen I implore you. Sincerely, Cheryl Citron 9198476492

Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Judy Starnes

Comment: Susan Vogel 1945 ball branch road boone, NC 28607-8854 June 1, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Dear Governor Perdue: As a state employee at Appalachian State University and a Watauga County foster parent and a support to reunified families, I am especially worried to see the proposed cuts in mental health and community support services and juvenile crime prevention. One of my former foster children, a male of 15 with developmental disabilities, has gotten off probation and turned his direction around thanks to a terrific community support worker, prevention services through Western Youth Network afterschool, and caring juvenile court personnel. I am also very concerned about increases in class size and cuts in teaching and assistant staffs in the elementary grades. What is not paid for now, in taxes, will be paid for by us as taxpayers and by these challenged children later. Throughout its history, North Carolina's greatest successes as a state have been closely tied to its willingness to invest in public structures - whether it was public schools, higher education, transportation, public health and safety, or environmental protection and preservation. We have created and protected these assets over many years, because they are the engine that drives our prosperity. The House Health and Human Services budget that was released contains cuts that will decimate the mental and behavioral health services for NC's most vulnerable children and families. Years of investments to develop the continuum of care for our state's greatest asset, its children, will be eliminated and result in unimaginable fiscal and human costs. In addition, the cuts will result in massive job losses that will only exacerbate our current economic crisis by increasing our unemployment rate and decreasing our tax base. North Carolina cannot afford to cut its way out of this fiscal crisis. We need a balanced solution for the state budget that enacts smart cuts and raises new revenue. Absent assertive action from you, we risk losing years of investments, increasing our costs for the future and escalating our current fiscal crisis. We need you to modernize our tax system to raise revenue that will offset the cuts to core services for NC's children and families. This is the only solution to sustain our state's current and future prosperity. Sincerely, Susan Weinberg Vogel Sincerely, Susan Vogel 8282641071

Comment: Elizabeth Morin-Kensicki 204 Forsyth Drive Chapel Hill, NC 27517-5538 June 2, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: I looked at the State budget proposal this morning and came away horrified. Hard choices in NC apparently means making life harder for the poorest and neediest North Carolinians. Looks like those least likely to voice an objection get to be the targets for a balanced budget- that's not actually hard work on the part of our leaders is it? That's the easy route, the path of least resistance. Do NOT take that path. I am writing to request that you all do your jobs and present a more equitable plan for budget balancing that should- as past economic downturns- include increasing revenues through temporary tax increases for those least in need including upper income individuals and profitable businesses. Y'all need to show some spine and earn your keep. This is no time to destroy social progress that has been so hard to achieve. Best Regards, Elizabeth Morin-Kensicki

I am a psychiatry resident in Winston-Salem, NC. Mental health is already dismal in our state, and further cuts will have huge direct and indirect effects on the people of NC. Consider the costs of caring for one autistic child, the social and medical devastation of one untreated alcoholic, and the funds needed for one person with schizophrenia. At a time when we are channeling billions to fight a fraudulent war, to think we can't spend even a tiny fraction to care for those with mental illness is disgusting. Sincerely, Bryan Smith M.D.

Subject: Proposed CAP/MRDD Cuts

Comment: To Governor Purdue: My name is Emily Vail and I am a resident of Greensboro. I have learned that our governing bodies are considering cuts to the current CAP/MRDD programs, which are in addition to cuts that were made just in October of last year. A growing population of our county and state, both young and old, have disabilities that prevent them from speaking for themselves. These disabilities have no prejudice. They affect everyone. A young member of my family receives services from CAP. He deserves to be taught, nurtured and stimulated to his greatest potential, whatever that may be. Who are we to put a limit on that? No family can do it all. CAP is a part of the Village that is raising this child and hundreds of others. CAP/MRDD helps to insure our citizens of all ages with special needs are safe and secure in their home environment, are well cared for, and to provide respite for their primary caregivers. Our elected leaders are business owners, attorneys, educators. Professional individuals who we have elected to make informed and well-balanced decisions for our population. Please consider carefully these critical programs and their impact on our large special needs population. We need them. Many thanks. Have a good day. Sincerely, Emily J. Vail 1815 Natchez Trace Greensboro, NC 27455 (336) 282-5096

Perdue, I am asking you to protect heath care for children in the state of NC by saying NO to the proposed devastating budget cuts. One of the reasons we moved to NC was because of the health care provided through Health Choice for our nine year old Autistic son.

Please continue to keep in mind the basic welfare of our youngest North Carolinians when voting on these budget cuts. I feel confident there must be a more balanced, less devastating way to pull us through thsi economic crisis. And I am asking you to please consider other options.

The decisions you make now will affect this state for decades. The current proposals to balance the state budget with cuts alone would devastate North Carolina's economy, communities, and families. Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. If we want to continue our progress in not being in the bottom 10 states in the US on markers for educational progress of our children, health of our citizen, teen pregnancy, and other key markers of healthy communities, we can not cut these programs. The cuts you make to education now will criple our economic viability years down the line when these children become adults. The cuts you make to medicade and public health risk the health an well-being of our entire community. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. It is in times of great crisis that the social service and educational programs our state has previously invested in become most critical. It is also in times of great crisis that great postivie changes can be made. Please use this oppertunity to look at not only the critical services we offer as a state, but also how we raise revenue. We are all in this together, and we can all contribute. Sincerely, Andrea Kurtz 336-721-9373

Revenue must be part of the solution. Cutting services and positions that protect our environment is a short-sighted approach that we will pay for dearly in the future; the cost to repair environmental damage is almost always greater than the cost of prevention would have been. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. As a Raleigh, NC resident I am willing to make the very minimal personal sacrifices that would be necessary to protect some of these vital services and I believe that others are as well.

Subject: Cut YOUR budget, not mine

Comment: Deborah Shrader 144 Creekstone Drive Benson, NC 27504-9189 June 2, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: Dear North Carolina legislator, Below I am reiterating what I am sure thousands are sending to you, however, I have my own words to say first: COMMON SENSE IS NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT...AND IT IS SIMPLE: If you don't have it to spend, you don't spend, and you don't borrow to spend. The more social programs you put out there...the more hands are going to raise up for handouts. Teach a man to fish, then he can feed himself. If you keep handing fish to him...he'll never do anything. WAKE UP! Chaos is on the horizon.... This is not the time to raise taxes in any way! In 1991 and 2001, your colleagues and predecessors raised taxes to pay for spending programs taxpayers could no longer afford. As a result, North Carolina now has the twentieth highest tax burden in the country, and one of the highest in the South. We have one of the highest income tax rates in the country, and it starts at a lower level of income than most states. We also have the highest corporate income tax rate in the Southeast. The spending and tax plans presented by Gov. Perdue and Senate Democrats would repeat the pattern with up to $1 per pack more for cigarettes, a 280 percent increase in taxes on other kinds of tobacco, higher taxes on beer and alcohol, higher and more complicated income taxes, higher taxes for businesses, and a new six-percent sales tax on everything I do online, plus home repairs, car repairs, extended warranties, or even a haircut. If I manage to make my mortgage payments to keep my house, even though my federal taxes also pay the mortgage for less responsible borrowers, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it in good shape. If I manage to make my car payments, even though my federal taxes also pay for cars I will never see, my reward will be a new six percent tax to keep it running. If I lose my job or health insurance or if my 401(k) has become a 201(k), my taxes still go to pay for the salaries, pensions, and health insurance of state employees who earn more in salary and benefits than people in the private sector. The problem with the budget this year is not that tax revenues are down. The problem is that state spending has grown beyond the means of taxpayers. The General Fund budget grew 34 percent during Gov. Easley's second term while former Speaker Jim Black was taking money in IHOP bathrooms, and the former governor was flying and driving everywhere in free vehicles. I am not alone in my desire that you look for ways to save money and cut spending instead of raising taxes. Recent polls from the Civitas Institute show that 68 percent of people think cuts to existing programs are the best way to balance the budget. And 73 percent think lower taxes are a better way to stimulate the economy than higher government spending. The Federal stimulus money is a band-aid. Please use it to heal the broken state budget, eliminate programs, and not place more burdens on taxpayers. Sincerely, Deborah M. Shrader 919-989-9085

Subject: New Revenues Must be Part of the Budget Solution

Comment: Lisa Toler 129 Moses Griffin Lane New Bern, NC 28562-2244 June 2, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: The current proposals to balance the state budget with cuts alone would devastate North Carolina's economy, communities, and families. Revenue must be part of the solution. In recent years, North Carolina has made wise investments in education, children's healthcare, public safety, housing assistance, environmental protection and programs for older adults and the disabled. Now is not the time for you, as one of our state's leaders, to retreat from these investments and others you have championed in the past. I am asking you to follow the lead of the Senate and 32 other states and take a balanced approach to the budget crisis. The balanced way to address North Carolina's budget shortfall is to make wise spending choices and raise revenue. Sincerely, Lisa M. Toler

Subject: Budget Cuts

Comment: I am addressing you today in my concern of the proposed budget cuts to reduce state employees. I have been researching various avenues of the budget and proposed cuts to be made. I realize that times are hard and the economy is in one of the worst times we have seen. I am urging you as Governor to acknowledge our state employees and reconsider the budget cuts that are proposed. I am the parent of a third grade elementary school teacher who teaches in the Alamance-Burlington School district who loves her job. All during her childhood she always wanted to be a teacher. Now she is being told her job may not be secured because of budget cuts. Her mission in life was to the BEST teacher and to touch the lives of many children who need not only an education but the love and understanding that many children do not receive at home. She loves the eagerness, love, and excitement her children show in the classroom of learning and being encouraged to do their best in everything in life. Not only does she spend many hours to prepare each day to be the best teacher for each child in her class, she spends many dollars to provide items for her class so all children can learn. What a shame money is being proposed in the state budget for unnecessary items and not for our children! I also have another daughter who just graduated from college - in the top of her class with a degree in elementary education. She worked hard the four years at Appalachian State University, always setting her goals high and maintaining each semester being on the dean's and chancellor's list because she also knew she wanted to be the BEST teacher she could be. Again, no jobs available because of the budget cuts that are being proposed. I am also a mother-in-law of a great "son" who works for the SBI lab in Greensboro. He also worked hard his four years of college and pursued his "dream job" with the SBI. He was honored to be chosen for the position because the interview process was long and very detailed (over 5 months). Now he is being told the lab may be closed because of budget cuts. This lab has helped reduce the long waits of cases that were in the Ralsigh lab. By reducing the length of wait for investigation of evidence in this lab, criminal cases are now being brought into court in a timely manner with cases being solved and those that are guilty taken off the streets to prevent even more crimes. Again, budget cuts affecting another important area. Where has this state and nation gone to? Are we the state that puts animals, YMCA's and other things ahead of what is important - our children and communities? In your budget recommendation, you said you would focus on"Improving Public Education" and "Keeping Our Communities Safe". Also a quote from your website - "I am stepping up to the plate to help our citizens when they need it the most. Despite our nation's tough economic situation, I stand ready to strengthen our middle class, improve public education and public safety, and ensure that government works smart for our citizens." Is it "smart" for our citizens to sacrifice those positions that are critical to our children and community? Again, I know the economy is bleak. I have seen it in my workplace and other places. My family has made "budget cuts" to help in case of emergencies that may arise. Everyone has made budget cuts to help alleviate the loss we have all faced with the stock market, 401K's, etc. I urge you to help protect our state employees. They are very valuable to the state and every county in our state. We as tax payers are willing to pay a taz increase to help "save" the jobs of these important people. Can you have a heart and help secure these positions? Thank you for your time. Please consider saving our children and communities. They are our future!

Subject: MH/DD/SAS Budget

Comment: Kim Shivar 610 Pine Tree Dr New Bern, NC 28562-4430 June 2, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Dear Governor Perdue: ATTENTION!! These cuts in the MH/DD/SAS budget are devastating and will effect many, many lives! These services are saving lives and without them what will happen? We cannot afford to lose services or positions in this field!!! These individuals need their services and support! If it means raising taxes, then we need to do so! If service are cut or eliminated it will have a devastating affect on the individuals, their families, staff and society as a whole. Who is going to be responsible when people in service decompensate, regress and or worse? Services are already soooo limited in the MH/DD/SAS world, if they are financially cut more who will be responsible in supporting these individuals in their homes, community and neighborhoods as these cuts would be detrimental to everyone? We need to all WAKE UP and look not only at the numbers on the paper but also look at the individuals and lives these numbers will seriously affect in such a harmful way!! We need to be exploring other options immediately. What if these cuts effected your neighbor or neighbor's child, Your son or daughter, your Mother or father? How many years worth of hard work and effort are we throwing away by allowing such devestating cuts!? Kim Shivar Sincerely, Kim Shivar
