Why don’t you do something about all of the animals in your state who are being killed in shelters very day?????? No one ever wants to hear about this? Why?  Why don’t you people spay and neuter your dogs and cats? If you did this like we do up north you wouldn’t have to kill innocent dogs and cats every day and make them suffer due to stupid, stupid, people. We are trying to save your dogs every day here, and we are rescuing a lot of them thank god, and they don’t have to face the BARBERIC deaths that they are given on a daily basis by you d—b people. I cant in a million years accept the way you people think, up here in the northern states are dogs are our pets, they are loved and they are valued, when we lose one,it hurts, really bad.  You need to do something about this, you are someone that can make a difference, I am speaking for all the innocent animals slaughtered every day in your state, because their voices cannot be heard and no one of importance seems to be listening to all the voices that are trying to save them every day, iam one of those people. Just rescued a beautiful lab, who had 10 puppies in one of your shelters, only one baby lived. They where gonna heartstick her because no one wanted her. She arrived on a rescue transport to me 3 weeks ago. She is precious, I cannot imagine our family without her. Only wish there was more people like me that have saved a southern dog…………………..don’t know what is more cruel, the gassing or the heartsticks?  Surprised your not just shooting the poor souls, well I’m sure that’s going on also……………………………………you have the power to change the laws…DO SO for the ones that don’t have a voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! one pissed off lady up north

Gov. Perdue visits Surry and Alleghany counties

Surry County

On Tuesday, Gov. Perdue attended a class and met with students at the Surry Early College High School of Design on Surry Community College’s campus in Dobson.  North Carolina is a national leader when it comes to Early Colleges, with 70 locations.  Students enrolled in this program attend high school on a college campus for five years and finish with a high school diploma and two years of transferable college credit or an associate degree – at no cost to the student.

Gov. Perdue met with Principal Celia Hodges, Community College President Dr. Deborah Friedman, members of the college’s board, and other local education officials.  Most importantly, Gov. Perdue had the opportunity to sit in on a biology class taught by Jeff Edwards. 

Students told the Governor about being excited to “get a really good head start on life” and about how North Carolina’s Early College program makes higher education affordable to them.  Innovative programs like this are important to Gov. Perdue’s goal of putting higher education within reach for all North Carolinians.

Alleghany County

On Wednesday, Gov. Perdue visited Sparta Elementary School.  As part of President Obama’s “United We Serve” campaign for community service and volunteerism, the governor spoke with students about their responsibility of giving back to their communities.  She read the children's book “I’m Gonna Like Me: Letting Off A Little Self-Esteem” by actress Jamie Lee Curtis to a first grade class. 

The governor also had the chance to talk to Superintendent Cox, Principal Barnes, and teachers about how technology is making a difference in their classrooms and about diagnostic testing.

DuPont Brings $55 Million Expansion to Bladen County

DuPont will add a new facility on a portion of its Fayetteville Works campus in Bladen County, creating 10 jobs and investing $55 million during the next three years.  The announcement of the new plant, which will make a key component in solar energy panels, was made possible in part by a $50,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

“DuPont's expansion confirms that we are reaping the benefits from our investments in a knowledge-based work force and community infrastructure,” Perdue said.  “Support of our existing industries, education and an exceptional quality of life are among the many reasons North Carolina's business climate is consistently ranked among the top in the nation.”

DuPont employs 60,000 workers in 70 countries worldwide, including more than 900 at N.C. facilities in Fayetteville, Kinston and the Research Triangle Park.  The new plant, in Bladen County near the Cumberland-Bladen County line, will produce polymer for DuPont ™ Tedlar® polyvinyl fluoride film used in the protective backsheets of photovoltaic solar panels.  These panels convert light into electric power.  The photovoltaic industry is experiencing worldwide growth as consumers turn to alternatives such as fossil fuels. 

Salaries for the 10 new skilled manufacturer positions will vary by job type, but the average annual wage will be $36,278, not including benefits, more than the Bladen County average annual wage of $25,792.

For more information about DuPont™ Tedlar® films or potential job opportunities, please visit: <http://www.dupont.com>www.dupont.com.

Swedish Firm Relocates U.S. Headquarters to Charlotte

Biotage LLC, a Swedish company that develops and manufactures instruments and consumables for pharmaceutical research, will relocate its United States headquarters to Charlotte.  The company plans to invest in facility upgrades and create 21 new jobs in Mecklenburg County.

“North Carolina is known globally as a strategic location for tapping into the North American market,” Perdue said.  “Our top-rated business climate and highly skilled workforce continue to attract global companies looking to invest and expand.”

Biotage is a leading supplier of tools and technology for medicinal and analytical chemistry and process development.  The company, headquartered in Sweden, has offices in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan and employs nearly 270 workers worldwide.

The company is planning to move its U.S. headquarters from Virginia to North Carolina.  Operations in Charlotte will include general administration, marketing and sales, and lab work for applications development, light manufacturing and distribution.

Gov. Perdue Announces Launch of 15th Anniversary "Booze It & Lose It" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced the launch of the 15th anniversary “Booze It & Lose It” mobilization to crack down on impaired drivers. The Labor Day “Booze It & Lose It” campaign will begin Aug. 21 and run until Sept. 7.

“Under no circumstance is drinking and driving acceptable in North Carolina,” said Perdue. “For 15 years, the ‘Booze It & Lose It’ initiative has played a critical role in protecting our citizens by educating the public and cracking down on impaired driving. We’ll keep using this life-saving campaign as a tool to enforce our state’s anti-drinking and driving laws.”

In North Carolina in 2008, there were 11,968 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 433 fatalities and 9,263 injuries.

“Booze It & Lose It” is administered by the N.C. Governor’s Highway Safety Program. The initiative began in 1994 and was created to zero in on impaired drivers with innovative and extensive anti-driving while impaired enforcement and education. Since 1994, law enforcement agencies have conducted more than 194,000 checkpoints and patrols during “Booze It & Lose It” campaigns resulting in more than 103,000 driving while impaired citations.

Additional checkpoints and patrols will be conducted across the state throughout the campaign.

Fight the Flu - Back to School

As thousands of students in North Carolina prepare to return to school, many will be armed with notebooks and pencils, but they also should be armed with tips to fight the spread of seasonal and H1N1 flu.

Everyone is advised to get a seasonal Flu Vaccine. H1N1 vaccines are expected by late fall. High risk groups, including school-aged children, are advised to get a double dose H1N1 vaccination.

Prevention is critical.  Here are some simple steps:

1) Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.  If you don’t have tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.

2) Wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand cleaners also are effective.

3) Avoid close contact with sick people.

4) If you are sick, stay home to limit the chances of infecting others.

Dear Governor Perdue,

My name is Bill Wood and I have been employed as a State prosecutor in Guilford County for over 20 years.
I learned today that there may be a proposal in the budget currently being considered by the legislature to eliminate not only future longevity payments to state employees but also all longevity accumulated by any employee up to this point. I am shocked. I never saw this coming and feel certain that there must be some mistake. My family will suffer greatly if this is true. I have two beautiful children doing their best to prepare for college, two car payments and a mortgage. I cannot financially survive a monthly pay cut of almost $1700. Why would this be considered? The most experienced and tenured employees are the ones being punished. On several occasions over the years I have been told I would not be getting a raise or would only be getting a modest raise because I was coming up on a longevity increase. Now, if this is true, it is being wiped out. It is my belief that someone has not considered the consequences of this action. Surely there is another way. Why can't the starting salary for new hires be reduced? At least new employees would know what the conditions of employment were going in rather than changing the rules on experienced employees who have worked very hard for years and have relied on the State  to provide longevity as a condition of salary.

I am not a bitter person and  really love my job. I show up every day at my office and work hard. I have never gone to my boss and asked for a raise. If one was justified it usually happened. There must be thousands of employees sitting in the same financial boat that I am in who depend on their hard earned check. Please eliminate this proposal from the budget. I realize times are tough but punishing public servants is not the answer. There is another way.


                                                              Sincerely,

                                                               Bill Wood

Governor Perdue and Secretary Cansler,

I am writing on behalf of Margaret Hiatt and her three sons.  I have been trying to intervene on their behalf to secure Medicaid Waiver, CAP-MR/DD, services.  I believe they are not unique and other families are having the same problem.  I have tried to suggest that a simple exception can be made for all of the families who have more than one adult residing in the home and receiving CAP-MR/DD services.  If DHHS/DMA/DMHDDSAS truly believe that the Comprehensive Waiver that became effective 11/1/08 does not allow for any exceptions, then why are they not considering a simple Technical Amendment? 

Here is the relevant language from the waiver document (top of Page 9 of 189):

The #0662 Comprehensive Waiver will offer adult participants the opportunity to choose their parents, guardian of the person or other family member to provide a daily service through a Home Supports service definition. Home Supports will be similar to Residential Supports which is provided in the group homes. Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.
>> NOTE BY MARY SHORT (1/13/09):  In the above paragraph, please be aware that Residential Supports is provided in GROUP HOMES.  Meaning, that the provider is paid for MORE THAN ONE individual to provide a 24-hour service to each individual.  Because Medicaid is billed for "1 unit" of service (24 hours equals 1 unit), a provider who has 4 residents can bill 4 units a day without violating Medicaid billing rules.  And that is necessary because a provider may take a resident to a medical doctor who is also going to bill Medicaid for "units" of services within that same 24-hour period.
A Technical Amendment (TA ... and there were four TA's to the previous waiver) would be quite simple: 

Parents who reside with their adult child may only provide Home Supports. Alternative services, Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services, will be provided by someone not living with the participant.  However, parent(s) who reside with more than one adult child may provide Home Supports in the same manner as Residential Supports are provided in group homes OR alternative services of Home and Community Supports and Personal Care Services may be provided in conjunction with others not living with the participants.

All my suggested TA does is return these families to hourly services to be provided by either the parent(s) or other staff, related or unrelated, living with or not living with.  And as hourly services, any one person would not bill for more than 16 hours a day!  And as hourly services, any one person could work in any combination needed amongst all the CAP-MR/DD recipients in the home!

I am not shocked by the attached response (see Word file attached).  This is consistent with my attempts at suggesting the above alternatives.  DMA/DMHDDSAS completely refuse to acknowledge there is anything they can do to fix the problem.  And please, please understand that "a plan of care and appropriate services have been developed to meet the needs of all three of your sons" is only PART of the truth!  Ms. Hiatt has been told she had NO ALTERNATIVE.  I have no idea what other families have been told.  I truly don't believe there are more than 35 families who would need this exception or TA.

Please, Gov. Perdue or Sec. Cansler contact me as soon as possible so that we can work toward getting these families the simple services they ALL had under the previous waiver!  I have Ms. Hiatt's permission to release information.

Governor Bev Purdue
Office of Governor
20301 Mail Service Service Center
Raleigh, North Carolina 27699-0301



Dear Governor Purdue,

I have the privilege of being witness to your first months in office as the first woman governor of this great state of North Carolina. Your tenacity and compassion for your citizens inspires me during this time of our fiscal challenge. I have fallen victim to a bureaucratic anomaly rife with inconsistency and unfairness. Your audience and attention to this issue I am requesting and I will deeply value your input.


I entered the North Carolina Department of Education as a music teacher in Durham, North Carolina in the fall of 2004. Because my degrees are in music performance(Bachelor/ Masters) I was issued a Lateral Entry-Provisional License. I attended all of the Beginning Teacher activities as mandated by the school system and I submitted and successfully completed the observation cycle. In August of 2005, I relocated to Fairfax County where I served successfully, as a music teacher for three years.. I desired to relocate to be closer to my parents and initiated that pursuit in the spring of last year.


I contacted Department of Pupil Instruction (DPI) in May of 2008 and inquired if I would be allowed to teach. A DPI representative informed me that yes, I had two more years on my Provisional/ Lateral Entry license. During these remaining two years, I would be able to fulfill the education requirements that I lack. (As my Bachelors and Masters are in Performance) I simply needed to seek vacant positions, interview, and the interested counties would then contact DPI. I interviewed in the counties of Mecklenburg, Orange, and Guilford. I was offered a contract in Orange County and Guilford County expressed great interest in me as a candidate, but had a concern with DPI. I was told to contact DPI which I did immediately. I was surprised to discover that DPI had switched polices regarding how the 3 years of my license was interpreted. They decided that the three years of a license were to be consecutive. I was told that I would not be eligible to employment as a teacher until August of 2010 or until I was able to take the appropriate classes. This news created great fear turmoil for me, as I am a single mother of two boys, nine and twelve. Plans had been made to relocate to North Carolina based on the May conversation I had with DPI. I was forced to move in with my mother who in September was diagnosed with stage four cancers. The circumstances merited that I cash out my retirement to meet my financial demands. Finally, I became employed as a Teacher’s Assistant in Wake County. Yes, I was thankful to find work, but I realized that I would be unable to take the coursework that would allow me to teach due to the salary that I would receive. In December I was contacted by DPI with what I thought to be good news. As I was told, DPI realized that there shift in how the three years contract years of the Provisional License had created a financial hardship. I was not the only individual in this predicament. If
I could prove that I was offered a job based upon the initial interpretation of “three years” I could indeed work. I state that yes, I had been issued a job offer and that I had that contract in my possession. Unfortunately, a month later I was told that I would only be able to teach in the position for which I received an offer. I replied” ...how absurd...that the position was not open…the position was not held for me…DPI was offering a faux olive branch…” to which that I was correct…and that yes, it was unfair.

Governor Purdue, it is my hope that you can help me. I want to teach and I am outstanding at what I do. I remain anxious to take the required coursework and I look forward to how it will increase my effectiveness as a music teacher. I want to provide a better standard of living for my two sons and myself. DPI has been unfair to me and I assume that I am not the only person that has experienced this treatment. Whatever you are moved to do or choose to do, I will appreciate and will respect.

With every good wish, I remain…


Denise Forbes

See if you can click this link.  Would you like to tell the family of
Raymond Curtis McLean that the alert was sent but no one could get the

money...and a poor way to publicize such ain important subject.
Can we please get someone in TIMS to fix this problem?
Thank you.

Hi – Mr. Helms sent this exact same email 257 times between 8:20am and 8:35am this morning. That’s excessive to say the least and in my opinion, bordering on abuse of the Governor’s email. I’m copying the rest of our team on this in case Mr. Helms calls our office (if he hasn’t done so already).



If you can expedite getting a response out on this one, that would help greatly.

Mike Helms

Dear Mr. Helms,

I am writing in response to your e-mails inquiring about the status of your brother Tim Helms.  Tim is currently housed in the hospital at Central Prison in Raleigh.

On August 3, 2008, while Tim was housed at Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville, he set a large fire in his cell.  When officers entered his blazing and smoke-filled cell, they found him lying on the floor and pulled him out.   He was seen by medical personnel shortly thereafter and appeared to have suffered only some minor scrapes in the incident.

In the days following that fire, Tim became ill and was hospitalized.  Medical confidentiality laws do not permit me to discuss his medical condition in detail with you.  Tim has not indicated any family contacts to be notified, and after the fire and onset of his illness, he said he did not wish to contact any members of his family.

If you wish to visit Tim at Central Prison you may contact the prison visitation office at (919) 715-2052 or CPVISIT@DOC.STATE.NC.US   Before visiting, you must first complete a visitor's application and submit that for approval.  Once approved as a visitor, you may schedule a visiting appointment.  The visitation office can advise you on this process.

Information you have received from other inmates regarding Tim being a witness to the death of inmate Ronald Burris is inaccurate.   At that time of that incident, which happened at Central Prison, Tim was located at a hospital in Greensboro, so it would not have been possible for him to have been a witness or had any involvement.

Additionally, there is no evidence to support any claim that Tim was beaten by officers while handcuffed.

Subject: NCSSM Tuition Grant Repeal for 2009 & 2010 Graduates



Dear Governor Perdue:

The repeal of full tuition grant for The North Carolina School of Science & Math, that is outlined in section 9.7(a) of the Appropriation Act of 2009 that is being sponsored by Senators Garrou, Albertson, Dannelly and Swindell for the graduating class of 2009 and 2010 is unfair and unjust.  The class of 2009 have already made their college decision based on this pledge/promise of a tuition grant by the State of North Carolina.  The class of 2010 accepted admission to NCSSM based on this pledge/promise of a tuition grant by the state of North Carolina. NCSSM's graduating class of 2009 and 20010 tuition grant should be grandfathered.

It is crucial that members of both 2009 and 2010 graduating class receive the tuition grant that they were pledged when they began their studies at NCSSM as a junior.  My student left his home town with the promise by the great state of North Carolina that he would be receiving a tuition grant from any of the 16 UNC state universities if he was accepted, and he had full faith in that promise by the State of North Carolina.  This tuition grant is a very important award for academic merit for these students.

As a result of attending NCSSM, my son has not been able to find any part time work, due to the fact he is only home one weekend out of every month.  Please note that every NCSSM student is required to perform work service at the school, from answering the switchboard, to working in the kitchen, and in addition, every NCSSM student also performs over 65 hours of community service,  which is a requirement for graduation.  Workservice, community service, and all college-level courses are required of NCSSM students.  All community service hours must be performed within a North Carolina state organization, or North Carolina charity.

What does it take to get accepted into NCSSM?  You need to take numerous tests and obtain numerous teacher recommendation letters.  The classes my son attends at NCSSM are all college level and above.  My son received a  "800" in math and an "780" in verbal and writing on his SAT test, and has chosen to stay in NC at a UNC university for his college experience based on the promise of a tuition grant. He applied "early action", was accepted and made his commitment.  I am sure you are well aware of the commitment each NCSSM student makes to the state of North Carolina, and to NCSSM.  Please note that all congressional districts are represented in the student population at NCSSM.

How can we build a better North Carolina, if all our best and brightest go to another state for high education?  Please keep full faith to the tuition grant promised to the graduation class of 2009 and 2010.  Before tuition was granted, only abut 55% of graduating students remained in NC, now over 80% of graduating students stay in North Carolina for higher education based on the tuition grant. 

Please do not repeal the tuition grant for this years' graduating class (2009) and 2010, have the tuition grant grandfathered for these student, and please take into consideration all that is required of NCSSM students (work service, community service, college-level classes, living away from home) when re-writing any laws pertaining to the tuition grant for future classes.

Thank you.

Mrs Perdue,

     My name is SPC. Travis Rawls. I am with the 30th Brigade National Guard unit Out of Williamston, NC.  I was placed on Active Duty orders on Dec. 1st 2008.  We went on title 10 orders on Feb 11, 2009.  I was injured during a training exercise while on title 10 orders.  I was sent home due to my injury and was made nondeployable.  When i got home they stripped me from my orders and they have not put me in front of a medical board or even so much as sent me to other doctors to try to get me fixed!  I was in the Marine Corps for four years and I know that when injured on active duty status they have to treat you and pay you as if you r on active duty!  I am not receiving anything at all.  Its almost as if the military is saying well we hurt you now we don't need you because your hurt so your no good to us we are sending you home and taking everything away from you.  I have had to go back to my civilian job working at Bertie Prison as a correctional officer standing on my feet for 12 hours with 2 injured feet!  Just because the National Guard is not doing there job!  I am just asking for some input on this and possibly your help to find out what I am eligiable for and what i can do to get medical attention!  Please help me with this issue.  I don't want to feel like the rest of these soldiers that got sent home and say this is how the military looks at me now after i signed the papers to put my life on the line.  I love being in the military but I dont want to be a part of something that is not going to look out for you if you are hurt under its watch.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Like many other environmental educators in our state, I too am shocked at your recommendation to dismantle North Carolina’s Office of Environmental Education.  Obviously, early in your tenure, you realized some of the problems that formal educators in our state face by reorganizing your Education advisors.  

I am a tenured professor of Education at UNCG.  I have served on the faculty at UNCG for nearly seventeen years. I came to UNCG and taught environmental education before we had an environmental education certification program in North Carolina. I have advocated tirelessly for the incorporation of this certification program into our state education certification program, as have many others, but to no avail. My students want this desperately. But, rather than moving forward toward that goal, you propose to move us backwards by dismantling the very office that has worked to achieve this end. I would suggest that instead of eliminating the Office of Environmental Education that you take some of your necessary budget cuts from the Department of Public Instruction (DPI).  The savings would be immense, not paltry.

If we destroy our environment, and we are making good progress in that direction, then we will not need education. As Henry David Thoreau said, “What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?”

DPI is an excellent example of a place where you could make the kind of budget cut that you propose for the Office of Environmental Education and minimally affect services. Additionally, you risk alienating fewer teachers, professors and informal educators who believe that the most important education we can offer at this time is environmental education.

I just read in our University newspaper, Campus Weekly, that you will be giving the commencement address at UNCG on May 15, 2009. I hope that you will seriously reconsider your suggestion to eliminate the Office of Environmental Education.  I think that you will get a much more enthusiastic reception in May from our many students and faculty if you take a strong stand to support this vital component of becoming a learned person.  

Sincerely.

Dr. Catherine E. Matthews

Please keep the tuition grants available to the NCSSM Class of 2009 & 2010. The students , especially the 2009 Seniors , who are graduating on June 6, 2009.

Most of these students have already obligated themselves to attend one of the 16 NC Universities, partly because of the grants. Many have turned down schools in other states with scholarships.

April 3, 2009

Gov. Bev Perdue,

Regarding the Appropriation Act of 2009, I am dismayed to hear that the NC State Legislature is considering repealing the tuition grant that has been promised to the current students (class of 2009 and 2010) of The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. 

NCSSM is an exemplary school that has filled a void in the public school system for almost 30 years.  Many of the students that attend have exhausted all of the math courses at their home schools by tenth grade.  These are precocious students with bright futures ahead of them.  They would have been one of the top students at their home high schools and qualified for several scholarships.  Instead, they chose the road of leaving their family and friends behind to pursue excellence in education.   The challenge at NCSSM is great even for the brightest students and they work very hard late into the night five or six nights per week to complete the homework load.

My son is a student at NCSSM.  It was very difficult to watch my fifteen year old go off to a school that is two and a half hours from home.   In his junior year at NCSSM he is taking all first and second year college courses in math and science.  He was one of a few at our home high school … he is one of many at NCSSM.  His opportunities to earn an academic scholarship were greatly reduced when he chose to attend NCSSM.  It was very difficult for my son to leave his friends, his home high school, and his family.  He told me that the tuition grant was his main reason for choosing NCSSM.

I understand the budget crisis our state and many states across the country are facing right now.  This is a difficult time in our country’s history.  Please do not loose site of what made this country so great.  It was original thinking and entrepreneurship.  The students at NCSSM are the key to North Carolina’s future.  Before the tuition grant was offered only 55% of NCSSM graduates remained in state for college, with the grant in place, 80% choose to stay in state.  Let’s work to keep these kids here in North Carolina for college so they will want to build their life here after college and bring new opportunities to grow North Carolina’s economy.

Academic scholarships are becoming very rare.  High school students who work so far above and beyond their piers should be rewarded for their academic excellence.  Please do whatever you can to retain the tuition grant for the NCSSM classes of 2009 and 2010.

Thank you,

Joan Finn

Governor Purdue,
Last night my son said he was glad that he voted for you. He's a teacher and recently received his National Board Certification. He's concerned about larger class sizes and probable lay offs. Students will suffer.
Hopefully your commitment to public education will prevail just as the TARHEELS did last night.

Subject: Teacher needs help.



My name is Leigh Anne Shore.  I am a teacher and have some concerns about how teachers are sometimes treated in the field of education.



To give you some background, I am 31 years old and have been teaching for 8 years.  I went to UNC-CH and graduated with 2 majors and the equivalent of a minor.  (BA K-6 Elementary Education, BA English, and Minor in ESL.)  As a result I have 2 teaching licenses K-6 Elementary Ed and K-12 ESL.  I have always wanted to be a teacher.  When I moved from regular Ed to ESL, I decided that I needed more Spanish-Speaking skills, so I attended a prestigious language school in Middlebury, Vermont, where I became relatively proficient in conversational Spanish.  Then I applied for a scholarship to study abroad for 3 months to further my Spanish-speaking skills.  I did this of my own volition and paid for it out of my own pocket.  Finally, in 2007, I got my National Board Certification at an ESL specialist.  I am only telling you all of this, so that you know I am dedicated to the profession as well as my students, and I have worked very hard to be the very best teacher I can be. 



Here are my issues:



1) The state paid for my National Board Certification.  I was pregnant while I worked on it, and had an infant when I took the test.  That was my choice.  The plan all along was that I would work part time once our baby boy was born, and then go back to teaching full time as he reached school age.  I was unaware until I was well into the process that I had to teach FULL TIME in order to not refund the state the $2500 fee.  I knew that I had to teach in NC the year following my certification, and I planned for that, but it wasn't until I was 6 months pregnant and nearly through the process that a friend told me that I would have to work FULL TIME.  Although the website, may have been changed by now, it was not even mentioned there.  I read all of the criteria BEFORE I signed on for the process.



Now, I am being asked to refund the state $2500 dollars.  I appealed in a letter, but received what I believe to be a form letter in return denying my request.  (It did not address any of the points in my appeal.)  I am currently teaching ESL, as a specialist, part time, and I did so last year,so I AM using what I learned from the National Board Process in NC.  Isn't that the whole point of the rule about teaching in NC the year following the process?  I plan to continue to teach in NC in the coming years.  However, I have to say that I am now disheartened.



Would you please consider taking a look at this case.  I have taught for 2 years part time following the NBC process which is equivalent to 1 year teaching.  At the very least, could you please use what power you have to reduce the cost and require me to pay only 1/2 of the fee back since I am working 1/2 time?  Although I do not feel that I should have to repay the $2500 fee, these two options seem more fair and legitimate to me.



2) I have become disheartened by this whole situation.  You see, I have taught ESL for 6 years now.  (I taught regular ed before.)  During those 6 years I did not work with another ESL teacher who was licensed in that area until this year.  They came in lateral entry or with another teaching degree and did far less work to get their ESL license than I did, if they got it at all.  They also were sometimes paid more than me, based on years of experience in education or years with the state.  These things have always seemed unfair to me.  I often feel punished for going to school to become a teacher instead of coming in to teaching from a different profession. 



I have done the best I can to be the best teacher I can be.  PLEASE consider taking a look at this case for me.  Call me if you have any questions (336.945.4295), or respond to this email. 



Thank you for your time.

Mr. Arnold,



I attached a letter to Governor Perdue. I am a physician in rural NC and I provide medical services

for persons with HIV/AIDS. Beverly Perdue and I were inducted into the YWCA Academy of Women together in 2005. I have a letter seh sent 

me congratulating me on my service to HIV/AIDS. I proudly display that letter in my office.

It is important that she reads my letter strongly protesting proposed cuts in Medicaid reimbursement for HIV Case Management Services.

This would be devestating to rural NC. Please make sure she gets this!

I will anxiously await a response. 

Thank you so much,

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.



“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.



“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.



On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  



“My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. 



Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).



“My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”



As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 



Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."



Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 



Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.



“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety’s Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Muslim "Civil Rights Group" Hosts Terror Supporter/ Fundraiser

The Cleveland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has invited Monzer Taleb to speak at its annual banquet. Who is Monzer Taleb? <http://ohioagainstterror.blogspot.com/2009/04/former-hamas-crooner-to-speak-at-cair.html>Central Ohioans Against Terror:

Monzer Taleb (aka Munzir Taleb, Monzer Talib, et al.) was part of the infamous Al-Sakhra Band, which toured the US raising money for HLF [Holy Land Foundation] and the terrorist group, HAMAS.

This charming man's band toured with the HLF singing this song:

I am from Hamas and have never cheered for anyone else besides her, she is the way to reciprocate the deceit of the attacker.

And she is the one which marches with the light of Muhammad, and it is the one which marches with the light of Muhammad, with the light of Muhammad towards Jihad, towards Jihad, towards Jihad, towards Jihad by its renewed determination.

It only gets worse, so before going to <http://ohioagainstterror.blogspot.com/2009/04/former-hamas-crooner-to-speak-at-cair.html>read the rest here be sure to remove all objects that might be thrown at your computer's screen.

Remember, these people claim they are a civil rights organization.

<http://ohioagainstterror.blogspot.com/2009/04/former-hamas-crooner-to-speak-at-cair.html>Former HAMAS fundraiser/crooner Monzer Taleb to speak at CAIR-Cleveland fundraiser this weekend, sang about exterminating Jews, “I am from HAMAS!”

<http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MsIXV-UEH5w/SdV7NZWelSI/AAAAAAAACJ4/Du6u1QiBzFw/s1600-h/cair-monzer.jpg>


Before the Holy Land Foundation was <https://treas.gov/press/releases/po837.htm>closed by the US government as a designated global terrorist fundraising entity just weeks after the 9/11 attacks, Monzer Taleb (aka Munzir Taleb, <http://epicmasjid.net/docs/fr-invitation-3.htm>Monzer Talib, et al.) was part of the infamous Al-Sakhra Band, which toured the US raising money for HLF and the terrorist group, HAMAS. [UPDATE: It appears that not only was Taleb a fundraiser for HLF, but he was also named unindicted co-conspirator in the HLF terror finance case. See below for more details.]

As part of Al-Sakhra, Monzer Taleb sang of violence, terror and hatred. Dallas-based investigative reporter Todd Bensman described the group of terror crooners in his article, “<http://www.weeklystandard.com/content/public/articles/000/000/006/685mkanq.asp>HAMAS Rock Stars,” as follows:

It wasn’t exactly feel-good music in the conventional sense. Mufid’s Al Sakhra (“The Rock”) band crooned a gospel of death and hatred toward the Jews at Hamas fundraisers, while the collection plates moved through wildly enthusiastic Arab-American audiences.

In the <http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/74.pdf>indictment of Holy Land Foundation executives, federal prosecutors said that skits and songs performed by Al-Sakhra “advocated the destruction of the State of Israel and glorified the killing of Jewish people.” (p. 13)

Now Monzer Taleb continues his HAMAS fundraising as a featured speaker for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Cleveland chapter’s annual banquet this coming Sunday:

CLEVELAND 7th ANNUAL FUNDRAISING BANQUET
Sunday, April 5, 2009

Embassy Suites — Cleveland Rockside
5800 Rockside Woods Blvd.
Independence, OH 44131

Speakers:
Hussam Ayloush, Executive Director, CAIR Los Angeles

CAIR was <http://www.nysun.com/national/islamic-groups-named-in-hamas-funding-case/55778/>named unindicted co-conspirator in the recently concluded Holy Land Foundation terrorism finance trial, which resulted in <http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112508dnmetholylandverdicts.1e5022504.html>guilty verdicts on all 108 counts against the defendants. During the trial, FBI Agent Lara Burns testified that <http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/10/fbi-cair-is-a-front-group-and.html>CAIR was a front for HAMAS. As a result of the substantial evidence presented during the trial tying CAIR to the international Islamic terrorist network, the <http://www.investigativeproject.org/985/fbi-cuts-off-cair-over-hamas-questions>FBI recently cut its ties to CAIR, as has the <http://www.investigativeproject.org/blog/2009/02/columbus-police-kick-cair-to-the-curb.html>Columbus Police Department and Police Academy.

One of the defendants in the Holy Land Foundation trial, Mufid Abdulqader, who was convicted on conspiracy charges, was the leader of Al-Sakhra. After he was indicted along with the other Holy Land Foundation executives, a Dallas TV station <http://cbs11tv.com/local/Hamas.Mufid.Abdulqader.2.492834.html>revealed that Abdulqader is the half-brother of HAMAS leader Khaled Mishal. Trial exhibits also revealed that Al-Sakhra had <http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/440.pdf>performed at 25 HLF fundraisers in one year alone.

Monzer Taleb also figured into the Holy Land Foundation trial as he was personally named as unindicted co-conspirator in the case, in addition to CAIR, as this graphic taken from the federal prosecutors’ <http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/423.pdf>list of unindicted co-conspirators indicates (p. 6, no. 40 — click graphic for larger image):

<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_MsIXV-UEH5w/SdXieqi2yRI/AAAAAAAACKA/9xPNF1vbEcU/s1600-h/monzer+taleb+hlf+conspirator.jpg>



Videos of the Al-Sakhra Band were also entered into evidence by federal prosecutors to show the connection between the “charity” and HAMAS. In fact, one solo performance by Monzer Taleb was particularly difficult for defense attorneys to explain away, as Taleb sang “I am from HAMAS” (<http://www.investigativeproject.org/830/elbarasse-search-32-video-f>complete video and transcript available from the Investigative Project):



[Caption on the screen]
I am from Hamas
[End of caption]

Munzir: I am from Hamas and have never cheered for anyone else besides her.

I am from Hamas and have never cheered for anyone else besides her, she is the way to reciprocate the deceit of the attacker.

And she is the one which marches with the light of Muhammad, and it is the one which marches with the light of Muhammad, with the light of Muhammad towards Jihad, towards Jihad, towards Jihad, towards Jihad by its renewed determination.

[Caption on the screen]
Hamas
A continuous revolution
[End of caption]


Another troubling video of the entire troupe, including Taleb, was presented as evidence of them singing about the murdering and enslavement of the Jews (<http://www.investigativeproject.org/852/mushtaha-search-1-video>full video and transcript available from the Investigative Project):



Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
Khaibar, Khaibar, O Jews.
The Army of Muhammad will return
We will crawl and fight.

In a January 2001 <http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/01/29/2001_01_29_052_TNY_LIBRY_000022603?currentPage=all>article in the New Yorker, Jeffrey Goldberg explained the significance of the popular Islamic chant:

I had not heard this particular slogan since 1991, during the first Intifada, but that was in Gaza, and it was the fundamentalists of the militant Islamic group Hamas who had chanted it. This crowd was beardless — a mostly secular crowd. Khaybar is the name of an oasis near Medina that, in the time of Muhammad, was populated mainly by Jews. In the year 628, Muhammad led the Muslims against it, defeating the Jews in battle and subjugating the survivors, who would later be expelled from Arabia. The intent of the slogan, then, is clear: what the army of Muhammad did to the Jews fourteen hundred years ago in Arabia it would soon do again in Palestine.

Another interesting tidbit gathered from this video is that the drum played by Taleb bears the Arabic inscription, “Al-Sakhra Band, Islamic Association for Palestine”. The now-closed Islamic Association for Palestine was the <http://www.investigativeproject.org/article/621>parent organization of CAIR.

In yet <http://www.investigativeproject.org/858/mushtaha-search-1-video-g>another video Monzer Taleb is introduced as part of Al-Sakhra by Holy Land Foundation President and CEO Shurki Abu Baker, as they sang:


O Hamas the religion
Get rid of these enemies.
O sword of the Muslims.
Hamas the Jihad.
O Hamas the religion
Get rid of these enemies.
O sword of the Muslims.
Hamas the religion
O Hamas the religion
Get rid of these enemies.
O sword of the Muslims.
We challenge with our Quran.
We challenge with our Quran.
Our youth are roaming around.
Our youth are roaming around.
We challenge with our Quran.
We challenge with our Quran.
Our youth are roaming around.
Our youth are roaming around.
And our dwellings will not be returned.
And nothing will wash our disgrace,
Except blood and stones.
Rebel, rebel, rebel.
Rebel, rebel, rebel.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

It wasn’t just Monzer Taleb’s participation in the Al-Sakhra Band that got the attention of federal prosecutors, as he was also identified in seized Holy Land Foundation documents as the <http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/438.pdf>head of the “Artistic Aspect” of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestine Committee responsible for fundraising and propaganda in the US on behalf of HAMAS (click to enlarge).

Monzer Taleb has continued his “artistic” pursuits by authoring and directing a play, “<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/myna/message/2219>Once Upon a Time in Medina”, about the early battles of conquest by the Muslims and the “grand conspiracy” of the Jews against Islam. The play was presented in February 2004 by the Muslim American Society Youth Center of Dallas, which Taleb founded and directs.

And of course, CAIR-Cleveland has run into its own troubles with promoting hatred and violence, such as their attempt in March 2008 to <http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2008/03/20/news/local/library0321.txt>present a hate-filled movie at the Cleveland Heights Library, which was loudly denounced by Jewish groups in Northeast Ohio. But when CAIR-Cleveland features speakers such as Monzer Taleb at their annual banquet, is it really any surprise?!

Dear Governor Perdue:



In May, 1909, the late Rev. W. R.

Kilgoe.



As part of this celebration, we are requesting an acknowledgment from your office recognizing the 100th anniversary of:

Hi Alice,



Thank you so much for your email.



Governor Purdue has signed our proclamation declaring April Child Abuse Prevention Month. We are very grateful.



We would like to request Governor Purdue’s presence at an event celebrating Child Abuse Prevention Month on Saturday, April 25th at 4pm at Middle Creek High School in Apex, NC. During Child Abuse Prevention Month, thousands of North Carolinians gather to show their support for children and families through events hosted by community groups, local DSS and Smart Start agencies, schools, churches and other groups. This year, these events are all the more important because they are focusing on steps that every individual can take to prevent abuse, regardless of the economy and budgets.



The students at Middle Creek High School have chosen to host the first-ever walk for prevention to prove that every individual can make a difference. The event is entirely student generated and run, with support from school faculty and guidance from our agency. Their plans on the 25th include the walk, family activities and the planting of a pinwheel garden (with pinwheels representing healthy, happy childhoods.) They will also be holding mini-events throughout the preceding week. Our office will be coordinating media presence. We can expand this presence to highlight the Governor’s attendance and include remarks by Governor Purdue if she wishes. This way, the event is not riding on the Governor’s attendance, but would be significantly enhanced by it.



I would be happy to talk with you to coordinate details for this event. I can also suggest alternative events that the Governor can attend if this one proves inconvenient. If you are interested in learning more about activities and themes for Child Abuse Prevention Month, we have them available on our website at <http://www.preventchildabusenc.org/april>www.preventchildabusenc.org/april.



Thank you!

Elizabeth

Hi!



We are preparing to kick off Child Abuse Prevention Month, a time when thousands of people affiliated with North Carolina schools, community groups and DSS agencies gather to raise awareness for prevention and family support. I wanted to see if the Governor’s office would be interested in working with us on some sort of media event during the month of April.



Many of our partners feel very stressed out about the budget and what it’ll mean for their services. Though it’s short notice, we’d love to work with your office to help Governor Purdue show her support for children and families.  Our annual April Campaign focuses on the roles that all adults can play in creating healthy communities for children (i.e. neighbors helping with childcare, churches creating parent support groups, etc.) While services are critical, some of the most important things communities and individuals can do to support children and families can happen regardless of the economic climate.



We have already submitted the proclamation request, and have our fingers crossed… We are also assisting local communities in creating local events across the state. We can very easily create things like pinwheel gardens – pinwheels being the symbol for a healthy, nurtured childhood – as a quick, good-looking, pro-kids-and-family visual.



I’d love the opportunity to talk to someone about partnering with the Governor’s office to show support for children and families during April. Could you please point me toward the appropriate contact? If you’d like to see some of our April materials to get the gist of the campaign, you can go to <http://www.preventchildabusenc.org/april>www.preventchildabusenc.org/april. I look forward to hearing from you.



Thanks!

Subject: PARDON RYAN BALDWIN - A CHILD IN CRISIS



Dear Governor Perdue:



I am writing to ask you to please  “PARDON “  my Grandson,  Ryan M. Baldwin.



His crime :  Having to suffer with a misunderstood Chronic illness :  ME/CFS  !



Currently :  Jailed by the Department of Social Services (DSS ) in a holding cell/bedroom                    

                    for the past 75 days, as of this writing, deep in the mountains of Ashe County, NC.



His Living Conditions :  Resides in a basement laundry room cell , sleeping next                    

                    to the washer/dryer .  He is free to leave his cell 3 times daily to

                    take his meals – provided he has enough energy to climb 2 sets of

                    stairs to eat in the kitchen - usually a meal he has to prepare himself,

                    consisting of a reheated hamburger,a yogurt and a glass of Gatorade

                    for lunch.  Dinner is always a surprise…either…reheated left-over

                    ham or  some greasy sausages and rice . He eats alone !!  There is no

                    one to talk to.  After his meal, he is relegated to return to his basement

                    cell .  He has no TV access, no computer access,  and no cell phone !!

                    When the parents are home, they usually just ignore him. His cell has a

                     working TV but no TV reception !  We have provided him with many

                     pre-recorded DVDs that he watches over and over again !  We have also

                     sent bags of apples, vitamins and some Easter candy in an attempt to

                     supplement his diet and raise his spirits !



Contacts With the Outside World :  Ryan is allowed to speak via phone with me,

                        his Grandfather, twice weekly.  DSS has limited my contact with

                        Ryan due to the fact that I usually ask him “ How he is feeling ? “

                        DSS considers this question to be  “ an inappropriate discussion of

                        his medical information “  and a violation of the court order, according

                        to the DSS Chief Attorney,  which states that “ medical information

                        may only be discussed by Ryan, his doctors and his Care Givers” !!



                        My copy of the Court Order contains no such language ,  but I must

                        obey the exalted Chief Attorney or they will sever all my contact !!

                       ( This is really retaliation for Ryan passing too much information to     

                        me concerning  his living conditions and the fact that he is getting

                        weaker by the day !! ) .



Professional Misconduct and Abuse :      Ryan has been held in DSS custody                        

                        for over 8 weeks, as of the date of this letter !  He has had no contact

                        with either parent  -  simply limited,  monitored contact with me.

                        Allegations of  “ Fictitious Disorder by Proxy “  are usually dismissed

                         by the Medical Community after 60 days  in solitary confinement with

                         no improvement in the Child’s condition !!  Ryan has  not only

                         shown no improvement……………..his condition has degraded, as

                         can be heard by his trembling voice on the phone .  The Foster Parents

                        consider this,  plus his constant chest and left arm pains to be caused

                        by  “ anxiety “  as stated to me by the Foster Parent.  They say that

                        this must be the case because they were told by DSS  “ that there is

                        nothing basically wrong with Ryan “ !!  I have recorded proof of these

                        allegations. The information was given to me, even after I advised the

                        Foster Care giver that I was recording him !!



                        However, Ryan mentioned to me that  “if it was anxiety, he would be

                        nervous and have “ butterflies “ in his stomach……….not constant

                        chest pain, weakness and severe headaches ! “ Ryan remains much

                        more intelligent than both the Foster Parents and DSS !  They have not,

                        as yet, broken his spirit !  All of his mental assessments and   

                       evaluations  have been past with flying colors.  He is Medically ill,  not

                       Mentally ill !  The one  symptom I have noticed is that he occasionally

                       has short term memory loss and apparently the extreme stress is causing

                       some hair loss also !



                        DSS will allow no use of his medically mandated power wheel chair,

                        and are even keeping his manual wheel chair from being used

                        whenever he is transported !  They are attempting to gradually

                        withdraw his use of a wheel chair and increase his exercise ………a

                        procedure that will either damage him further or end his life ;

                        according to all the latest medical research into ME/CFS !!





We therefore request that you , Governor Perdue, please do the ethical thing and

 PARDON  Ryan Baldwin, our Grandson.  As we are both in our 70’s , we would like

to spend our remaining years enjoying our only Grandson ,while he is still able to function !



Respectfully,



Dino & Trini Frattaroli

Subject: NCSSM Tuition Grant




Dear Governor Perdue,

I am a resident in Johnston County, NC.  I am concerned about that the state legislature is mulling over taking away the tuition grant for students attending North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). 

My Daughter Michelle is a senior at the NCSSM.  She went to NCSSM not only for the great educational opportunity but also for the tuition grant for her to attend NC state colleges.  We were under the impression that the tuition grant is secured for her college education and we could count on that.  She got accepted to UNC Chapel Hill a few weeks ago and we are very excited about that.  Michelle also agreed to attend UNC Chapel Hill because there is not better chance to get a great value and high quality education at the same time. 

My wife and my self discouraged my daughter from applying out of state colleges when she started her college application process because this great financial incentive and the high quality education that North Carolina is offering.  In addition, she did not apply any other scholarship because we feel that tuition grant will give us adequate financial assistance.  Now, the legislature plans to change the rule of the game at the last minutes.  We are puzzled and confused.  And it is too late to start her college application all over again.   

I believe NCSSM is one of the best education programs that North Carolina offers.  It gives student the opportunity to challenge themselves and be the best they can be.  I also believe that keep these highly achieved students in NC college system will have positive effect in NC college performance.  We all know that good education system will entice corporate investment and help recruiting employees.  I further believe that keeping these highly motivated students in North Carolina will help transforming our state from a traditional labor intensive manufacturing state to a technology focused state.  Only that, we can have no fear of recession and can say good bye to high un-employment rate.   

I hope our legislature will maintain the commitment and keep the tuition grant in the budget. 

Thanks.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.

Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.



Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.



“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.



“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.



On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  



“My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  



The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina. 



Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).



“My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”



As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 



Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."



Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 



Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.



“North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”



Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.



Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C. Department of Crime Control and Public Safety’s Web site at <http://www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp>www.nccrimecontrol.org/shp.

Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project

Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina’s first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.



The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.



“This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future,” Perdue said.  “It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise.”



The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

NCOpenBook.gov goes live

This week Governor Perdue launched the first wave of <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov, a government transparency website for searching state contracts and grants.  Gov. Perdue signed Executive Order No. 4 on January 12, her first day in office, ordering the creation of NC OpenBook.



“In the 21st century online accessibility and transparency should be the standard for public information,” Perdue said.  “We’re going to let the sun shine in on state contracts.”



<http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov provides a database of approximately 2,500 state contracts and 5,000 grants that are now available in a searchable format.  The Office of State Budget and Management is working with state agencies and departments to streamline their contract databases so that North Carolina will have a comprehensive searchable database online this year on NC OpenBook.gov.



In addition to state contracts and grants, <http://www.ncopenbook.gov/>NCOpenBook.gov will feature detailed information about state agency performance measures and planning as outlined in Executive Order No. 3.



Governor Bev Perdue leads White House Forum on Health Care Reform

On Tuesday, Governor Perdue hosted one of five regional White House Forums on Health Care Reform.  She stressed the benefits that lowering health care costs would have on businesses and government while trying to create jobs in the midst of economic crisis.  She also highlighted North Carolina solutions like Community Care that could work nationally.



In case you missed it, Rebecca Adelman of the US Department of Health and Human Services <http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/31/Regional-Health-Forum-Greensboro-Streamed-and-Live-blogged-at-1030/>live blogged the event.  You can also see a <http://healthreform.gov/slideshows/whforum_nc.html>photo gallery here.



Governor Hosts Education Town Hall Meeting in Wilmington

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.



Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.



“The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”



Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.



An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.



“The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”



House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.



The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.



The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.

One of our teachers, Ryan Koczot was asked by CNN to be one of the teachers that present at the Cable Convention in Washington DC showing how Broad Creek uses technology and cable in the classroom.  While there, he set up videoconferencing with his classroom.  The students and well as myself was able to talk with different congressmen as well as the head of the FCC.  We have a lot more connectivity set up due to this.  Thought since I was on the e-Learning Commission I would share this with you. Technology has made such a difference for our students.  Our teachers are as much engaged as our students.  How exciting to see veteran teachers motivated and doing what's right for students.  Thanks for all you do for the children and teachers in NC.

<http://blog.heritage.org/2009/04/03/federal-report-dc-school-voucher-program-improves-reading-scores/>Reading Scores

·                                  Posted April 3rd, 2009 at 3.05pm in <http://blog.heritage.org/category/education/>Education.  Heritage Foundation

The U.S. Department of Education’s released a report today presenting the finding of an academic evaluation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program. It found that, after three years, students who were offered vouchers to go to private school through the program had made statistically significant gains in reading achievement.

Specifically, the IES report found that “those offered a scholarship were performing at statistically higher levels in reading—equivalent to 3.1 months of additional learning.” Like previous evaluations, it also found that “the [Opportunity Scholarship Program] had a positive impact overall on parents’ reports of school satisfaction and safety…”

The report is accessible <http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20094050/pdf/20094050.pdf>here.

As regular readers of The Foundry will recall, <http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/11/morning-bell-the-same-chance-obama-had/>Congress inserted language in the recently-enacted Omnibus bill that placed the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program on tract to end after the next school year unless Congress (and the D.C. City Council) authorizes the program.

Key members of Congress, including California Senator Diane Feinstein, have said that the results of this academic evaluation should determine whether Congress renews the program.

In the wake of this report, Members of Congress and the Obama administration must now answer a simple question: do they really want to terminate a $14 million program that is improving the reading achievement of low-income, minority children in the nation’s capital?

Instead of ending this program, Congress and the administration should now be looking to expand it <http://www.heritage.org/research/education/upload/bg_2137.pdf>to let many more D.C. children have the opportunity to attend a safe and effective school of their parents’ choice.

Subject: Don't Kill Urban Coyotes, Enact Stronger Urban Planning Instead



Governor Bev Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,
Ashley Barham

On Wednesday, Governor Perdue hosted a town hall meeting at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington.  Joining Governor Perdue were State Schools CEO Bill Harrison and Community College President Scott Ralls.  A packed and lively crowd of 300 citizens asked questions and discussed education and workforce development issues with Governor Perdue, Harrison and Ralls.

> Governor Perdue on the State’s Motion to Intervene in Alcoa’s Yadkin River Hydroelectric Dam Relicensing

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced North Carolina’s Attorney General has, at her request, filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to participate in proceedings regarding the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam project on the Yadkin River.  Gov. Perdue is asking the commission to consider rededicating the public resource -- the river and the power generated by the dam – to public use that would serve the citizens and help North Carolina’s economy.

>  

> “The waters of the Yadkin River belong to the people of North Carolina.  Fifty years ago, we endorsed Alcoa’s request for a federal license to operate hydroelectric dams on the river because they powered the company’s aluminum smelting works.  That facility was a linchpin in the regional economy and created jobs for up to 1000 North Carolina workers.”  said Gov. Perdue. “Today the smelter and the jobs are gone – and so is the reason for the license.  I’m asking FERC to enable the recapture of the license so it can be used once  again to help create jobs and economic opportunity for the region.”

>  

> Governor Signs Legislation Authorizing Grandfather Mountain State Park

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev Perdue signed legislation formally authorizing Grandfather Mountain as the state’s newest state park.

>  

> An agreement for the state to purchase the undeveloped, backcountry portion of Grandfather Mountain was announced in September. Funding for the $12 million acquisition will come equally from the Parks and Recreation and Natural Heritage trust funds. Grandfather Mountain State Park will be comprised of these 2,456 acres, which the state will purchase from the Morton family later this spring.

>  

> “The creation of a signature state park at Grandfather Mountain is a big step in adding to the quality of life and beauty of our great state while we also preserve North Carolina’s spectacular public lands for future generations,” said Gov. Perdue.  “Thanks to the Morton family and our conservation partners, visitors from inside and outside of North Carolina will be able to enjoy the majesty of this wonderful mountain for generations to come.”

>  

> House and Senate authorization bills had 48 co-sponsoring legislators. The primary sponsor of Senate Bill 89 was Sen. Joe Sam Queen, of Haywood County. Primary sponsors of House Bill 128 were Reps. Phillip Frye of Mitchell County, Edgar Starnes of Caldwell County, and Cullie Tarleton of Watauga County.

>  

> The heirs of company founder Hugh Morton will continue to operate the travel destination with its nature center, wildlife habitats and “mile-high” swinging bridge on a paid admission basis. The acquisition agreement gives the state a conservation easement on 749 acres of the original property where the attraction is located. The state parks system is coordinating an interim management plan with the Morton family for the backcountry property and its 12 miles of trails.

>  

> The acquisition was arranged in 2008 with the help of The Conservation Fund and one of its directors, Mike Leonard, and The Nature Conservancy, which holds conservation easements on the mountain and surrounding properties totaling close to 4,000 acres. The property lies in Watauga, Avery and Caldwell counties, and contains the headwaters of both the Watauga and Linville rivers. Developed as an attraction by Hugh Morton in the 1950s, it boasts 73 rare species and is distinguished by the 5,946-foot Calloway Peak.

>  

> On-Site Accountability Visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute

On Thursday, Gov. Bev Perdue made an unannounced visit to the Pasquotank Correctional Institute in Elizabeth City.  During her 45-minute visit, she was shown the close custody section of the prison, the vocational unit, and she spoke at length with prison staff members.  

>  

> “My visit to Pasquotank Correctional Institute gave me the opportunity to see first hand the work our correctional officers and other staff do to protect the public’s safety.  This is one area, like all the segments of our public safety system, in which nothing less than the highest standards must be maintained,” said Perdue.  

>  

> The visit was a follow up on Gov. Perdue’s pledge to make on-site accountability inspections of state agencies across North Carolina.

> Governor Perdue, State Experts Join Fight Against Chronic Disease

Gov. Bev Perdue announced on Friday that North Carolina will become one of the largest states to join the <http://www.fightchronicdisease.org/>Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD).

>  

> “My goal is for North Carolina to be a national leader in health care,” said Perdue during a kick off event at the East Carolina Heart Institute in Greenville. “Cracking down on chronic disease will save lives, it will lessen the heavy burden of medical costs that many families face, and it will reduce health care expenses for our state.”

>  

> As national policy-makers consider new approaches to health care, PFCD amplifies the voices of individual states concerned about the millions of lives and billions of dollars lost to chronic disease.  a state level, PFCD brings together dozens of leading health care organizations (39 and counting) to share best practices and new ideas. 

>  

> Speaking alongside Gov. Perdue, Dr. Paul R.G. Cunningham, dean of the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University and co-chair of the NC PFCD, said, "To truly address the health care of every North Carolinian and American, comprehensive reform must go beyond providing better coverage.  It also must address chronic disease, the number one driver of health problems in our nation."

>  

> Cancer, heart disease, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases claim 1.7 million American lives per year and cost more than $1.5 trillion. The toll on North Carolina is also devastating, and threatens to get worse. 

>    

> Operation Slow Down

Monday, Gov. Bev Perdue announced that the N.C. State Highway Patrol and the Governor’s Highway Safety Program were kicking off Operation Slow Down/No Need 2 Speed to catch speeders on North Carolina’s highways. Local law enforcement agencies will join troopers from now through April 12 to encourage drivers to slow down and follow the speed limit.

>  

> “North Carolina law enforcement will be going after speeders who recklessly endanger our citizens,” said Perdue. “Speed is the leading cause of crashes on our highways. I urge motorists to slow down and obey the speed limit. ”

>  

> Last year 1,405 people were killed in traffic crashes on North Carolina highways; speed was the leading cause of those crashes.  Stepped-up enforcement will be conducted across the state, focusing on motorists speeding.

>  

> Dangerous driving can be reported to the Highway Patrol by dialing *HP on cellular phones from anywhere in the state. For more information about Operation Slow Down 2009, visit the N.C.

> Governor Breaks Ground on First Economic Recovery Highway Project
> Gov. Bev Perdue was joined by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti and local elected officials in Camden County at a groundbreaking on Thursday for one of North Carolina's first highway improvement projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The event was held at the George M. Wood Memorial Park on U.S. 158 in Camden County near the Camden/Pasquotank County line.
> 
> The $6.1 million project will widen a congested 2.4-mile stretch of U.S. 158 from east of the Pasquotank River to north of Havenwood Drive in Elizabeth City from two to four lanes. The highway is known locally as the Camden Causeway and serves as the main link between Elizabeth City and Camden and Currituck counties.
> 
> "This recovery project will make a significant contribution to Camden County and this region now and in the future," Perdue said.  "It will quickly put people to work and have a significant economic impact.  Improving U.S. 158 helps northeastern North Carolina prepare for future growth and ensures this region is ready when new opportunities arise."
> 
> The U.S. 158 widening project is one of 11 economic recovery projects awarded to contract in March. The projects are located in Alamance, Brunswick, Camden, Currituck, Forsyth/Stokes, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Scotland and Stanly counties.  It is also one of the $466 million first phase recovery infrastructure projects that are expected to create and sustain 14,000 jobs across the state.

Subject: Oil



Is this true???


The U. S. Geological Service issued a report in April ('08) that only scientists and oil men knew was coming, but man was it big. It was a revised report (hadn't been updated since '95) on how much oil was in this area of the western 2/3 of North Dakota ; western South Dakota; and extreme eastern Montana ..... check THIS out:
>
> The Bakken is the largest domestic oil discovery since Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay, and has the potential to eliminate all American dependence on foreign oil. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates it at 503 billion barrels.. Even if just 10% of the oil is recoverable... at $107 a barrel, we're looking at a resource base worth more than $5.3 trillion.
>
> 'When I first briefed legislators on this, you could practically see their jaws hit the floor. They had no idea.' says Terry Johnson, the Montana Legislature's financial analyst.
>
> 'This sizable find is now the highest-producing onshore oil field found in the past 56 years.' reports, The Pittsburgh Post Gazette. It's a formation known as the Williston Basin, but is more commonly referred to as the 'Bakken.' And it stretches from Northern Montana, through North Dakota and into Canada. For years, U. S. oil exploration has been considered a dead end. Even the 'Big Oil' companies gave up searching for major oil wells decades ago However, a recent technological breakthrough has opened up the Bakken's massive reserves.... and we now have access of up to 500 billion barrels. And because this is light, sweet oil, those billions of barrels will cost Americans just $16 PER BARREL!
>
> That's enough crude to fully fuel the American economy for 41 years straight.
>
> 2. And if THAT didn't throw you on the floor, then this next one should - because it's from TWO YEARS AGO!
>
> U S. Oil Discovery- Largest Reserve in the World!
> Stansberry Report Online - 4/20/2006
>
>
> Hidden 1,000 feet beneath the surface of the Rocky Mountains lies the largest untapped oil reserve in the world. It is more than 2 TRILLION barrels. On August 8, 2005 President Bush mandated its extraction. In three and a half years of high oil prices none has been extracted. With this motherload of oil why are we still fighting over off-shore drilling?
>
> They reported this stunning news: We have more oil inside our borders, than all the other proven reserves on earth. Here are the official estimates:
>
> - 8-times as much oil as Saudi Arabia
> - 18-times as much oil as Iraq
> - 21-times as much oil as Kuwait
> - 22-times as much oil as Iran
> - 500-times as much oil as Yemen
> - and it's all right here in the Western United States .
>
> HOW can this BE? HOW can we NOT BE extracting this? Because the environmentalists and others have blocked all efforts to help America become independent of foreign oil! Again, we are letting a small group of people dictate our lives and our economy....WHY?
>
> James Bartis, lead researcher with the study says we've got more oil in this very compact area than the entire Middle East -more than 2 TRILLION barrels untapped. That's more than all the proven oil reserves of crude oil in the world today, reports The Denver Post.
>
> Don't think 'OPEC' will drop its price - even with this find? Think again! It's all about the competitive marketplace, - it has to. Think OPEC just might be funding the environmentalists?
> Got your attention/ire up yet? Hope so! Now, while you're thinking about it .... and hopefully P.O'd, do this:
>
> 3. Pass this along. If you don't take a little time to do this, then you should stifle yourself the next time you want to complain about gas prices .. because by doing NOTHING, you've forfeited your right to complain

Subject: Don't Kill Urban Coyotes, Enact Stronger Urban Planning Instead



Governor Bev Perdue
Office of the Governor
20301 Mail Service Center
Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,
Ashley Barham

Attn:  Gov. MIke Easley,  Speaker Joe Hackney and Sen. Marc Basnight



Dear sirs:



Currently,  a situation exists within the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission that is in dire need or your attention. This situation is being fueled by the actions of some of the commissioners appointed by you. Politically, the results of what is going on now will have political repercussions that all of you should be very concerned with.  If you have no knowledge of what is going on,  or concern for our wildlife resources and the sportsmen and women, your outdoor (voting) constituents, who all stand to lose by what is going on now, you should be very concerned with these issues and do your own investigation to get a clear view of what the situation is.  If this direction by the commissioners is allowed to continue without input from sportsmen and even the wildlife professionals within the commission being considered, then the resource and the agency itself is at risk of suffering monumental damage that will be very difficult to recover from.



The agency itself, and all it's employees,  is also in complete turmoil due to the external pressures being levied upon them by some commissioners.



Please take notice of this very volatile situation and do the right thing to bring your appointees and our wildlife agency back in line with the goals of the agency,  the first being protection of our wildlife resources. Next,  satisfying the needs of the sportsmen who purchase hunting/fishing licenses that support the agency.  



Sincerely,



Ramon N. Bell

Governor Purdue,

I voted for you and was very confident about my vote, until the Principal of the school where I am employed, showed us the power point of the State cuts in education. I was appalled! These cuts will greatly impact the children's education!

Then, when we received our paychecks March 31st, there were teachers who received from hundreds to thousands of dollars more on their check as a bonus for performance award, plus longevity pay. If you took all that money, and the ABC bonus money away, maybe there could be jobs spared that will be diminished after this budget cut. I felt as though this performance award and longevity pay was an analogy of the CEO's that received a bonus with bail-out money. I was upset over this as you can tell. Thanks for listening. I just think education should come first in a matter as important as this........afterall, these children are our future leaders. Why cut them short?



Sincerely,

Lyn Flowers

Dear Mrs. Perdue I am a resident of Lumberton NC. I have attended Bladen
Community College for the last year taking my prerequisites to enter the
nursing program in the fall of 2009.I have taken all the classes my
councilors, and teachers told me to take and they actually made my
schedules for me.It is a year later and it is finally time to take the net
test ( nurse entrance
exam )which can only be taken once a year. I paid my dues for the test. My
counsilors and teachers reviewed
my classes and gave me the go ahead to take the test.My GPA is 3.92 ,
almost a perfect 4.0.  It is now one week
before the test, and I am told I cannot take the test because my councilor
made a
mistake and I was suppose to have taken biology 110, which is High School
Biology again. I did take it back in High School twenty years ago and they
knew
it. I have already taken Biology 168/ anatonmy 1 in college and passed the
course with an A actually a 99 for the entire semester, this biology is
much harder then the High School Biology.  They told me they would either
do an independent study with me, to allow me to take a summer mini
semester so I would still take my test and get credit for it. Well her it
is one week away and they said they are not going to allow me to take his
class at this point. ( Just to let you know they are allowing one student
to do the independent study , and there are four other students who were
also misguided by the same person ,for the same reason, and they are
telling us basically to take a hike.) I followed the chain of command . I
talked to the president of student services, He was useless. I then talked
to the Vice President, he said he would investigate it and let me know. He
then called me yesterday and said the teachers would not agree to it. Just
to let you know the teachers said, not only would they do it for us , but
would do it with no compensation to them at all.. The teachers here are
actually the best teachers I ever had. So he actually was telling a lie. I
then scheduled an appointnment with the president of the college today.
Not only did I attend, but another student in the same predicament
attended as well. The president heard us out. The Vice President was also
there. Tonight the Vice President called me at home and said the same
thing. "They said no". I asked him who they were, and all he could say was
" They said no ". Please answer this one question for me. How can a public
community college let one student have an independent study , and say no
to  the other four students in the same predicament?
 I have all the
emails the teachers sent me admitting they made a mistake and could gladly
correct it for me, but the college administration will not. I cannot
believe with the nursing shortage that there is, the adminitration of this
college, who not only can waiver the basic biology, will not correct the
mistake they made. My wife graduated the nursing program of this same
college only five years ago, She did not to do her high school biology
again. What can I do , I cannot even think about having to wait another
year for the opportunity to take this test. When it was not my mistake.
