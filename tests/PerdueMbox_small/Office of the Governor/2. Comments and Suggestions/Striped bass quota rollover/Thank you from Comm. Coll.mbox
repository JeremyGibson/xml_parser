Dear Governor Perdue,

As a trustee and former chair of the Davidson County Community College Board, the decrease in the percentage of the reversion requested for the Community Colleges is greatly appreciated. With the massive  increase in enrollment and the funding based upon last year’s enrollment, the reversion decrease decision does make economic sense and will allow the community colleges to meet some of the challenges today.



Again thank you for listening and making education a priority.

Dear Governor Purdue,

As a trustee of Nash Community College, I wish to thank you for your decision to reduce the community college reversion of funds from 5% to3% under Executive Order Number 21.  This order, plus the freeing of the 1% that each college was holding in reserve, will give the colleges the means to meet the extraordinary demands being placed on the community college system.  Thank you for the trust you have placed in us, the community colleges of North Carolina, to use these funds wisely for the benefit of our great state's future.

Sincerely,
Patricia B. Weeks
Nash Community College, Trustee

Governor Purdue thanks for the increase in Smart Start Funds.  The monies that came to Jones County are crucial in the implementation of all of our programs.  Though our county is small and our funds are equally as small they impact the children and families birth to 5 in Jones County in a tremendous way.  Ten years ago no star rated child care providers were in Jones County.  Today of the six (6) Centers in Jones County four (4) are Five Star and two (2) are Four Star. Four of our centers are More at Four Sites in the public schools providing Pre-K to each of our four townships.  Our parents in the past four years have attended a minimum of four high quality parent workshops here at Smart Start in our Family Support Activity and M@4 contract and without this additional money we would have had to cease this project.  Educating the child without educating the parent for some families is getting us no where fast. Thanks, again. Remember

 Research studies have documented that children who have spent time in high quality child care environments have lasting benefits from the experience.  This makes it

even more important for children in the neediest families (like those in Jones County) to have options in selecting a high quality child care setting without regards to the cost of high quality child care.

Governor, please allow me to join the many others who have expressed their appreciation for your support with the 2% reversion relief for the North Carolina Community College System.  As a president of one of the 58 institution who had experienced a very large enrollment increase due to the state of our economy, I can tell you having access to these funds for the 2010 spring semester will allow my college to employ faculty members and strategic support personnel to help serve the additional patrons who have turned to their community college for help.  The funds will also help us purchase some strategic equipment that is needed to provide up-to-date instruction for our students - one of the legislative priorities in the community college state budget.

Please know that the Board of Trustees and I are acutely aware of the challenges you have had to cope with since assuming the Governor's duties. In many instances, there have been no easy answers and we commend you on the work you are doing to keep North Carolina appealing from an economic development, tourism, and family living standpoint.  Press on.

Respectfully,
Charles
