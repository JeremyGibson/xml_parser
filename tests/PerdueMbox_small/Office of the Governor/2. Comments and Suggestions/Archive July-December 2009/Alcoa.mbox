Subject: Leave That Dam Alone!

Comment: Governor Perdue, As a concerned citizen, I ask that you cease your efforts to have the State of North Carolina take over Alcoa's dams on the Yadkin River. This move would be an affront to private property rights, an affront to our free market economy and a horrible move for a state government that is already struggling to make ends meet. Please leave that dam alone!

Comment: Maam, you must stop right now trying to take over property that you have no rights to. When the people find out that you are one of those that believes the government has rights to anything it wants, you will surely be fired. Alcoa's dams are Alcoa's and theirs alone. NOT YOURS. You people are like spoiled little children who think they can just take whatever they want. Read your American history, i implore you. These acts are disgusting are nothing more that government sanctioned theft to nationalize all resources in the country. Have a good day. MM

Subject: Yadkin River Trust

Comment: Honorable Governor Bev Perdue I urge you to desist any efforts to pass this "Yadkin River Trust" (SB967) or any version thereof. Also, please reject any attempts to attach this legislation to any other popular legislation to speed its passage through the House. I live on the shores of the Yadkin river and have been intimately involved in the negotiations of the FERC license process for the past five (5) years. I believe that the negotiated RSA and existing Federal and State laws more than adequately protect the water resource for the public. In addition, as a informed and responsible citizen of the USA, I'm appalled that this Bill to allow the State to "take-over" private enterprise would be considered. It would set a precedent in North Carolina that sends the message to private industry and businesses that this state can take your business if it perceives it to be financially or politically profitable. Please, SLOW DOWN AND READ THIS BILL CAREFULLY! Respectively, Mel Wofford 1852 Riverview Road Extension Lexington, N. C. 27292 Home (336) 798 1673 Mel Cell (336) 250 3273

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I wanted to express my displeasure in the bill proposed to effectively "take-over" the Yadkin river dams. Alcoa has owned this property since the early 1900s, and purchased free and clear. If this bill passes, it will set a tone for further "takings" in the future. I did vote for you in the last election, but feel your stance on this and healthcare will further put our lagging economy in peril.
