Dear Beverly Perdue,
This is not my first request to you to stop Cliffside. Please do whatever it takes to stop this coal power plant from going any further in it's plans.

How many times will it take until you know that too many people are surely in harm's way of this environmental disaster? If you tell me the answer I will write to you that many times.

Haven't you enough proof and facts to know coal power is harmful beyond repair? Do you not believe them? Do you care?

Come on ....stop Duke now.

Thank you,
Meredith McIntosh

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Joseph Hoffman

Address: 2298 Powell Brickyard Rd., Lenoir, NC 28645

Email: jd.hoffman2@hotmail.com

Subject: Cliffside Power Plant

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue , You pledged in your campaign to put North Carolina on a new clean energy path. I hope you will start by urging the Division of Air Quality to adhere to the Clean Air Act and maintain a "major" source pollution permit for Duke Energy's Cliffside plant. The new 800MW unit is not a "minor" source of pollution and should not be re-classified as such. It should use the maximum available control technology for hazardous emissions if it is to continue to be under construction. This is a plant that shouldn't be built in the first place. Please use your authority to put NC on a path to clean energy. Sincerely, Joseph Hoffman

Â North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue STOP CLIFFSIDE!
:
- Fire Division of Air Quality Chief Administrator Keith Overcash and replace him with someone who will fight for clean air rather than for polluting industries.
- Direct the DAQ to pull the Cliffside construction permit for violation of federal standards on Hazardous Air Pollants and Carbon Dioxide emissions.
- Direct the Utilities Comm ission to implement inverted, tiered rate restructuring to reduce statewide energy consumption.
