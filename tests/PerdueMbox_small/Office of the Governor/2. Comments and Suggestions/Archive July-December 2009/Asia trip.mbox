	Gov Perdue - I seem to recall that you are accepting or have accepted funds from a law firm and Progress Energy for your trip to China.  Please explain what is the difference?   Appears to be a conflict.

Gov. Perdue Focuses on Green,  Defense/Aerospace Jobs

Cree Announces 575 New 'Green' Jobs
Governor Perdue was on hand Thursday as Cree, the Durham-based maker of energy efficient LED lights, announced they were creating 575 new jobs over three years in North Carolina as they expand their manufacturing capacity.
"Green jobs are a cornerstone of my vision for building a 21st century global economy in North Carolina," Perdue said. "This job announcement fits perfectly with my plan to grow a world-leading green economy in North Carolina that turns green into gold for decades to come."
Parachute Manufacturer Brings 375 Jobs to Person County
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a national manufacturer of parachutes for military and sports uses, will expand in Person County.  The company will invest nearly $900,000 and create 375 jobs in Roxboro.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $300,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
“North Carolina, the nation’s most military-friendly state, maintains a strong manufacturing sector in support of our armed forces,” Perdue said.  “Our state’s skilled workforce and excellent business climate continue to attract growing businesses.”
North American Aerodynamics Inc., a privately held company founded in 1964, produces the globally distributed Parafoil Accuracy Parachute Canopy and parachutes for the sports and military sectors.  The company currently has 45 employees, along with 55 seasonally furloughed workers, at its headquarters and manufacturing facility in Person County.
The company, which recently secured a new military contract, plans to expand and renovate two existing nearby buildings to meet increased manufacturing demands. 
North Carolina continues to have a top-ranked business climate.  Through Gov. Perdue’s JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Governor Attends AUSA Conference in Washington, DC
Gov. Perdue on Monday attended the Association of the United States Army conference in Washington, DC.  In an effort to grow our military/aerospace economy, Gov. Perdue spent the day meeting with companies about locating in North Carolina.  She also met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Locke regarding funding to expand broadband access - the e-NC Authority is to receive $2 million in federal funds.

Gov. Perdue Announces Nearly $700,000 to Expand Outreach and to Insure Children Entering School

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday announced that North Carolina has received a $678,210 grant to fund health insurance outreach and enrollment for eligible, uninsured children. As detailed in her health care roadmap, the governor proclaimed her goal of all children having access to coverage and making sure all eligible children are enrolled.
“When our children enter public school, we need to ensure that they are healthy and ready to learn,” said Perdue. “This partnership will help us reach out to more young children across North Carolina to make sure they are receiving the care and coverage they need.”
The North Carolina “Healthy & Ready to Learn” (HRL) Partnership will identify uninsured children who are entering kindergarten and are eligible for Medicaid or N.C. Health Choice.  In the first year, the program will be piloted in a total of 16 high need rural and urban N.C. counties with thousands of eligible and uninsured kindergartners.  In year two, the program will expand statewide to all 4 and 5 year olds. North Carolina is one of 41 states awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
This is the third in a series of initiatives originally outlined in her health care roadmap issued during Gov. Perdue's campaign. Despite having to balance a budget deficit of $4.7 billion, Gov. Perdue has worked toward expanding health care coverage in North Carolina, including the expansion of SCHIP by 9,098 children. The governor also announced that North Carolina received $17 million from a competitive federal grant to expand coverage for uninsured working families, and nearly $3.9 million for Rural Hope, a program that will improve health care facilities in rural North Carolina.
Submit Your Suggestions to the StreetSafe Task Force

The first meeting of Gov. Perdue's <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=630>StreetSafe Task Force was on Thursday.  The task force is charged with finding ways to transition prisoners and probationers back to work instead of back to crime.
As part of the meeting members heard an overview of sentencing and recidivism in North Carolina and around the country, and they discussed their own ideas about how best to keep offenders out of prison and away from crime.  They also encourage the public to submit their own suggestions and recommendations.  You can contact the task force at <http://www.streetsafe.nc.gov/>www.streetsafe.nc.gov.
Attorney General Roy Cooper and Department of Corrections Secretary Alvin Keller co-chair the task force, which is made up of government, civic, community and law enforcement representatives.
Gov. Perdue Encourages Citizens to Provide Input for State Service Plan

Gov. Bev Perdue on Monday announced that the North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is asking for the public’s input on the state’s service needs for its three-year state service plan.  The Commission will feature a survey on its Web site, <http://www.volunteernc.org/>www.volunteernc.org, from Oct. 5-12th.
“I encourage North Carolina citizens to provide their input and become a part of shaping our state’s service and volunteerism goals,” said Perdue. “To create the most comprehensive plan, we need to hear as many people’s opinions on North Carolina’s human, education, environmental and public safety needs.”
The North Carolina Commission on Volunteerism and Community Service is required by law to develop a three-year state service plan to submit to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).  The plan is to establish and recognize the state’s priorities and address areas of community and state needs to improve lives and strengthen communities.  The 2010-2012 State Service Plan is due to CNCS in early November.
To access the survey, please visit <http://www.volunteernc.org/>www.volunteernc.org.

Governor Perdue,
Is this really the right time to go to Asia for 12 days?  The state is facing HUGE budget cuts and will be faced with more next year.  I agree that we need to expand our business market but that frankly should have been done a long time ago to realize profits for the present.
Our taxes are too high...how do we attract new businesses from foreign countries or other states?
I am so dissappointed with the decisions of this adminstration so far...not just Asia trip.  The good old boy network seems to be alive and well and shameless.  The opportunities to send a strong message about corruption and political patronage have been lost forever.  It seems business as usual in good ole NC.  
A very sad day for NC, indeed!
Safe travels to Asia!
Sincerely, 

--
