While the job creation information in this bulletin was good to see, I am confused about the "Healthy & Ready to Learn" initiative.
We already have the infrastructure in place to address these areas.† How about directing the additional resources toward those areas instead of cutting those budgets?† In case you need to know what those existing programs are, they are the Health Check Coordinators in each county's health department and the Smart Start local partnerships that serve all 100 counties.† Both of these areas, most often in collaboration with each other, have had good success in finding and enrolling uninsured children into Health Check programs.† Right now, we are in danger of losing those Health Check Coordinators due to the consolidation of case management that is under discussion at the state level.† That would be a very poor decision, especially in light of all of the glowing goals the Governor has as noted in this article.†

Please explain.

Thanks,
Deb Stranges

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, Please continue to work for citizens of North Carolina (and especially our local area here in Raleigh-Durham) to keep the 20 violent felons, who may be released on a technicality, incarcerated. Legal action should be taken to overturn any law that would allow them to be released in the coming months. The safety of NC families depends on your work to overturn the 1970's law that now may allow these murderers to go free. Thanks for your work, and we're depending on you and your work to keep us safe. All the best, Mike & Rachel Garrison Rougemont, NC

The AG and legislature has left us with a debacle which could jeodardize the life of our citizens.† There are victims or survivors of the violent inmates who need protection if they are released.† Hope there†are†folks left in Raleigh with some common sense.

This failure of the law to provide justice for heinous crimes is ample reason to move on with executions of those who have been sentenced to death.† With executions there is zero chance of this happening and there can be confidence that no one will be hurt again by these murderers.

Please stop this insane release of violent murderers.

Subject: N.C. to release 20 longtime inmates

Comment: According to the news, NC DOC is about to release 20 longterm inmates - 19 of them Sex Offenders and I would make an even bet that not a single one has successfully completed S.O.A.R. NC DOC's Sex Offender Accountability and Responsibility rehabilitation program - whose graduates, by the way, has a less than 5 percent recidivism rate. NC does not need Sex Offenders who have not successfully completed this program to be released into society. Why doesn't NC make it a law that all those sent to prison due to a sex related crime has to successfully complete this program before they can be released from prison? This would definitely make society a lot safer since any sex offender that had been sent to prison would have at least completed the best rehabilitation program NC has to offer - before they got released.

Subject: Ruling of NC Supreme Court to Release Violent Murderers and Rapists

Comment: I applaud Gov. Perdue's stand against their release. However, the following should be done. Remove/fire the idiot judges that handed down these decisions. Second, pass on to them they guaranteed themselves to be voted out the next election.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Dear Governor Perdue and legislators,

††† I am appalled that the state of North Carolina will release people who are truly†dangerous because the legislature in the 70's felt it knew how long a life sentence should be.† It is imperative that there be a review of all criminal laws on the books to ascertain that there remain no other loopholes through which dangerous criminals can get released .†† It seems to me that a life sentence should be exactly that: until the natural life of the inmate comes to an end.† It is unfair that victims and their families should suffer their natural life while the criminal is allowed to go free.†
††††† I recommend that the legislature show greater commitment to resolving the death penalty issue, rather than leaving it to whichever way the wind blows.† The death penalty is the only sure way of knowing that a given criminal will never again rain violence on another human being.† In the meantime,† How do you plan on making NC citizens safer given the release of these prisoners?

†††† Sincerely,
Ilona Kusa

Subject: Criminals being released

Comment: TO: Bev Perdue. Surely you can fight to have other prisoners released instead of convicted killers. You are the governor. How insane! Budget money more responsibly so that we can put our hard-earned tax money where it is needed, i.e., keeping hardened criminals behind bars. I pray no prisoner kills or harms anyone when they are released. It will be like, so sad, and hindsight, and our hands were tied, and all that, but a person will be lost forever. There are ways I am sure to get around letting out convicted killers. Our right of protection should be high up on your list of priorities. I understand your job is hard, but honestly -- a little common sense, please. Keep us safe. Keep killers behind bars. Please. Susan Anderson

The final ruling by the Supreme Court to release prisoners serving a  
life sentence is insane!  Have they all lost their minds?  I am  
incensed by this outrageous and preposterous decision.  In my opinion,  
this is a CRIMINAL act on the part of the Supreme Court.

  Please let me know what other officials I can contact to express my  
disbelief in what I  think is one of  the most unbelievable rulings I  
have heard of since living in the state of North Carolina.  Thank you.

Subject: Murders and Rapists go free

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I am a Greensboro attorney and a conservative Republican and I did not support you but you are the Governor so I write to you. I see the State is apparently giving up the fight with the NCSCt on the 80 year life sentence non-decision. I am appalled that murders and rapists are now going to be released. Can the your office not put pressure on the AG's office to petition the NCSCt to at the very least ask for a rehearing. Can't you? YOu are the Governor, Damnit!This may buy some time. The SCt has a statutory duty to hear matters and decide them, in matters of great public interest. The SCt should at the very least take the matter up and render an actual decision. To not take the case and at least buy some time is inexcusable. The people are not going to stand for this -- but what can we do? Take to the streets? At least with our votes. This is a disaster for justice. But what else is new? Murders going free, my goodness, what has the State of North Carolina come to? You have a moral duty to stop this even if you have to enter Orders that create litigation -- at least it will buy time. The people are watching -- do you have the guts to make some noise. You need to use your Bully Pulpit and put maximum pressue on the spine less Supreme Court to hear and find a loop hole to keep killers and rapists of 12 year old girls in prison. Act like a Leader! But you may be gone to Japan ... Oh Well, hae fun while Murders go free in your State. Mike Nash 336-337-6219

Madam Governor:

Today's article in our local Times News in Burlington, North Carolina tells of an unbelievable act of stupidity by State Government.† I don't have a solution to present to you for keeping these criminals behind bars.† I would point out that the odds are when these wolves get out of their cage they will go right back to doing what they have done in the past.

Stand up, sign an executive order declaring the idiotic law a mistake and keep these criminals behind bars until the legislature can correct this unbelievable mistake.

This is why you are the top person in state government, you must step up and protect our families!

George Adams

Subject: inmates

Comment: I've heard that some inmates are coming home early in my area. My fiance has been in prison for almost 2 years now. His release date is Feb, 2 2010. He is in there for drug charges. When he was in Norfolk,VA (2007)he attended a rehab in jail, and joined a bible study. He last charge was in 2006, he has held a job since the last charge and changed for the better. I've wouldnt be doing this if not. He was also going through courts and Social Services to get custody of his son. The mother had a drug problem and the state took his son. Now the son is going through the court system again. My fiance really wants his son, but the court is saying that they dont have time for him to get out. I just really want to know if they was anyway he could get out this year. His name is Kerry Lamont Woodley (0694267) Kerry and I have a daugther (21 month) and I have other daugther that is 5. He is great father to my kids, my 5 year old thanks alot of him. We are aware of his mistakes and so is he. I wanted to give this a try, just for his oldest son. I feel no child should be put through the court system and homes when the father is trying to step up to be the father. THANK YOU!

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue ~ I heard on the news this morning that 20 inmates who are servicing life sentences are to be released due to a 1974 law that states 80 years is a life sentence. The crimes were described as horrible offences. Please, consider the families and the citizens of North Carolina in doing all you can to ensure these individuals are not released.

Subject: Present & Future "Bowden Inmates"

Comment: Please consider becoming more publically outspoken about the release of these inmates. As a family member of a victum whose murderer falls within the criteria to be released in the next batch of "Bowden Inmates" I can tell you that our family has felt victimized over and over and over since inmate became parole eligible in 1999. We went from a sentence of death, to life, to life means parole eligible after 24 years but you can protest and it will help keep him incarcerated, to writing letters for 10 years to now having no input whatsoever. I know Governor Perdue cannot change the law, but she can certainly be more publically damning of it. Thank you.

Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.

The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.

ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î

The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission

Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our stateís second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ñ especially during this economic downturn.†

As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.

The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.

Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte

Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

ìNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,î Perdue said. ìPremierís pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.î

Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ñ ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ñ which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.

The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.

Through Gov. Perdueís JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

For more information about Premier Inc., including job opportunities, visit: <http://www.premierinc.com/>www.premierinc.com.

Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville County

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,î Perdue said.† ìOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.î

Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The companyís major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The projectís 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.

For more information on Shalag Industries, go to: <http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html>http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html.† For information on company job opportunities, visit the Employment Security Commission office at 518 Lewis St., Oxford, N.C., 27565, or call the office at 919-693-2686.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov> flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.

ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.

The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.

ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î

The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission

Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our stateís second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ñ especially during this economic downturn.†

As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.

The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.

Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte

Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

ìNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,î Perdue said. ìPremierís pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.î

Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ñ ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ñ which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.

The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.

Through Gov. Perdueís JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville County

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,î Perdue said.† ìOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.î

Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The companyís major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The projectís 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.

For more information on Shalag Industries, go to: <http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html>http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html.† For information on company job opportunities, visit the Employment Security Commission office at 518 Lewis St., Oxford, N.C., 27565, or call the office at 919-693-2686.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.

ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

> Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N..C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The court‚Äôs decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.
The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the court‚Äôs ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The court‚Äôs decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe the General Assembly‚Äôs intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.‚Äù
The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission
Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our state‚Äôs second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ‚Äì especially during this economic downturn.†
As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.
The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.
Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte
Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant..
‚ÄúNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúPremier‚Äôs pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.‚Äù
Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ‚Äì ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ‚Äì which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.
The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.
Through Gov. Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.‚Äù
Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The company‚Äôs major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:
To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it..
The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ‚Äì and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ‚Äì it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.
By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine..†
To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ‚Äúvaccine locator.‚Äù† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the state‚Äôs application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.
‚ÄúThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,‚Äù said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ‚ÄúThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.‚Äù
The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

Mrs. Perdue,


I am totally amazed at this ruiling. There are probaly 100 times more people locked up for drugs that should be released before murderers and rapists. To me, this all boils down to money. Why is this state so hard on drugs and so light on murder and rape? No one will pass the medical marijuana bill brought forth by nick mackey and several other legislators in north carolina. This would not only show compassion for patients who dont want to use these expensive pharmacy drugs that cause all these different side effects, and give them a natural alternative. But it would drasticly increase this the amount of tax revenue brought in by this state each year. I think if your office is appalled by this ruiling, you should take steps to make some of these alternative measures become powerful revenue earning programs that actually help the state. We vote our officials in because we want someone in office who is actually going to bring it to the next level. Not with old, but new ways of thinking. And new laws to increase the states revenue and make our state a better place for visitors and residents. Please, step up Mrs. Perdue! This is the time!

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.

ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

Gov. Perdue,
Its good that the Veterans are getting the help they earn. †You still need to fund Mental Heath Care and take the freeze off of Medicaid, so seniors can get the help they have earn! †How am I going to take care of my 83 year old Mother? † What are you going to do? Can you help me? †When will Rutherford county get jobs and funding? † Put the freeze on schools and roads, not on humans! † When are you going to do the right thing?
Sincerely,
John Barry Logan

The Office of the Governor:

How can this be done in the name of justice and fairness? Right now, I know a non-violent first time offender, Susan Barney from New Bern, NC, who was coerced by the District Attorney,†into a five year sentence with no parole. These people being freed are frightening to me and I am sure most everyone else in society, yet they get leniency while someone like Ms. Barney gets treated like a violent offender. Well after yesterday's ruling, she would be fortunate to be treated as a violent†offender. This is outrageous.†

Bev,



This is shameful and disappointing to many of us who supported you with money and energy.† All that is happening is that the law that the legislature passed 35 years ago is being enforced, and a small group of old offenders, who are unlikely to ever offend again, are being released after decades of paying their debt to society, instead of costing taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.† Rather than educating the public, this panders to citizens worst fears.

Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our stateís second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ñ especially during this economic downturn.†

As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.

The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.

Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte

Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

ìNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,î Perdue said. ìPremierís pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.î

Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ñ ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ñ which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.

The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.

Through Gov. Perdueís JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville County

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,î Perdue said.† ìOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.î

Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The companyís major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The projectís 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.

ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If Gov. Perdue is appalled by the court ruling, it is only because she has not examined the issue and is instead reacting in a manner calculated to get the most votes, not in the manner most beneficial to the citizens of North Carolina. What is appalling is the percentage of our population that is incarcerated and the fact that the Department of Corrections is fast becoming the largest employer in our state. The men and one woman who are due to be released have each served a minimum of 30 years in prison. While they may have been violent at one point in their lives, if 30 years in prison has not reformed them then our prison system has failed.

> Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.
The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.
ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î
The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

It is time to limit the power that lawyers have over our state and 
country. To let lawyers make laws, it is letting the fox in the hen 
house. Term limits need to be in place as well as limiting the number of 
lawyers, in congress and our legislature, making our laws. There is no 
excuse to let these killers loose and I blame the folks that are making 
the laws who are primarily the lawyers These lawyers are concerned only 
in lining their pockets and not the good of the people. I believe in 
swift and hard punishment that would make an impression on others to 
prevent future crimes. I have talked to various law enforcement people 
and there is a portion of the criminals that are paroled that are so 
sorry that they can't wait to get back into prison so they will not have 
to work. We should make prison a very unpleasant place, not a place to 
play basketball and look at TV. Make the inmates work.
There also should be a very high tax or very high fees placed on all 
PAC's. That would raise the dollars for the current shortfall in our 
budgets.

> Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.

> The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.

> ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î

> The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

> Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

> ìNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,î Perdue said. ìPremierís pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.î

Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.
The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.
ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î
The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.
Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission
Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our stateís second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ñ especially during this economic downturn.†
As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.
The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.
Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte
Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.
ìNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,î Perdue said. ìPremierís pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.î
Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ñ ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ñ which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.
The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.
Through Gov. Perdueís JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.
For more information about Premier Inc., including job opportunities, visit: <http://www.premierinc.com/>www.premierinc.com.
Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville County
Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
ìNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,î Perdue said.† ìOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.î
Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The companyís major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.
The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The projectís 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.
For more information on Shalag Industries, go to: <http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html>http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html.† For information on company job opportunities, visit the Employment Security Commission office at 518 Lewis St., Oxford, N.C., 27565, or call the office at 919-693-2686.
H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:
To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.
The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.
By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†
To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.
$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.
ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î
The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

Dear Governor Perdue, As An American Citizen I am appualed at the Courts ruling & Think the Judges should be FIRED, Preferably from a CANNON!.

> H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

> To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

> The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

> By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

> To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

> Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.

> The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.

> ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î

> The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Dear Legislators,
I am appalled at the thought of violent offenders being released from prison!!!!!† I have been begging for you to look at H1360!!!!! This bill would reduce prison overcrowding in the proper way.† Some of these inmates have recieved cruel and unusual punishments from this Repeat Offenders Law. Many of these are non-violent offenders!!!!!!† Even the Raleigh News& Observer has commented on the foolish costs to house non-violent offenders and the ridiculous years that some of these offenders have been sentenced.
My son,Randall Gray Stoneman. was found guilty of "speeding to alude and reckless driving".† He was sentenced to 12 to 16 years!!!!!!† This is NOT JUSTICE!!!! He could have committed murder and recieved a lesser sentence. He could also be getting released!!!! His crime was more of a traffic violation than a felony.†
PLEASE DO THE CONSTITUTIONAL†THING AND LOOK AT H1360!!!!!!!!!

Subject: Release of violent inmates

Comment: I am concerned about the release of inmates who were sentenced to life imprisonment and are now to be released. Is there nothing that can be done? I am sure the juries that convicted them never intended that they be released.

Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte

Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its =
headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over =
the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possi=
ble in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

"North Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation," P=
erdue said. "Premier's pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have=
 created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and g=
row."

Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare s=
ystems - ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities - whic=
h share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve health=
care quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more t=
han 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.

The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The =
300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not includ=
ing benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of =
$49,400.

Through Gov. Perdue's JobsNOW initiative (www.jobsnow.nc.gov<http://www.job=
snow.nc.gov/>), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, tr=
ain and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sust=
ainable economic future.

Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville C=
ounty

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used =
in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County=
.  The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxfo=
rd.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from th=
e One North Carolina Fund.

"North Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else =
in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants =
than anywhere else in the world," Perdue said.  "Our business-friendly poli=
cies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping =
companies build success in our state."

Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwove=
n fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.  The =
fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal=
 hygiene products.  The company's major customers include Johnson & Johnson=
, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construc=
t a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fa=
bric.  The project's 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966=
, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average=
 annual wage of $33,020.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way


A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist<http://www.governor.s=
tate.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Va=
ccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.  While t=
he total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the t=
otal doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enou=
gh vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make s=
ure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.  With such =
small amounts of vaccine - and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 d=
oses - it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.  =
The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vac=
cine was distributed to every part of the state.  With the next shipment, w=
e were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private p=
roviders who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that =
all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some v=
accine.  Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive=
 their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order du=
ring the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completel=
y filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the prov=
ider data continues to show a need for vaccine.

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is availa=
ble, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Departmen=
t of Health and Human Services to create a "vaccine locator."  When complet=
ed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going =
to flu.nc.gov<http://flu.nc.gov/> and typing in a zip code.  Until then, pe=
ople should either call their health care provider, their local health depa=
rtment, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for=
 more information.


$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mo=
untain


The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved =
the state's application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Vet=
erans Home in Black Mountain.  Conditions for the $14.6 million award inclu=
de finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and ad=
vertising and award of construction bids.

"This facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled c=
are that our veterans deserve," said Gov. Bev Perdue.  "The collaboration b=
etween the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human =
Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a gr=
eat example of government working for the people."

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western N=
orth Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary =
Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in feder=
al matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Bo=
th projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly =
and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2=
009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Faye=
tteville and the other in Salisbury.  Each of the new facilities will provi=
de residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

 The court&#8217;s decision in that case
 will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentenc=

<p><font size=3D"2">The governor this week received a list of 20 violent of=
fenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be release=
d in the next few years because of the court&#8217;s ruling. Each of the fi=
rst 20 inmates who will be released have
 been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The court&#8217;s deci=
sion also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Co=

8220;I don&#8217;t believe the General Assembly&#8217;s intent in 1974
 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these po=

Would you care to explain your silence (deafening) regarding Easley's abuses?

Was it "let him/her without sin cast the first stone?"

Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The court‚Äôs decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.
The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the court‚Äôs ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The court‚Äôs decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe the General Assembly‚Äôs intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.‚Äù
The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission
Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our state‚Äôs second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ‚Äì especially during this economic downturn.†
As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.
The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.
Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte
Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina prides itself on being a state that promotes innovation,‚Äù Perdue said. ‚ÄúPremier‚Äôs pioneering approach to healthcare shows that we have created a business climate in which innovative companies can prosper and grow.‚Äù
Premier is owned by more than 200 not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare systems ‚Äì ranging from small and rural to large inner-city facilities ‚Äì which share clinical knowledge and leverage purchasing volume to improve healthcare quality while reducing costs. The alliance provides services to more than 2,200 U.S. hospitals and more than 63,000 other healthcare providers.
The company currently employs more than 750 workers in North Carolina. The 300 new jobs will pay an overall average wage of $69,400 a year, not including benefits. That is higher than the Mecklenburg County annual average of $49,400.
Through Gov. Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative (<http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>www.jobsnow.nc.gov), the state continues to work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain its workforce, and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,‚Äù Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.‚Äù
Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The company‚Äôs major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.
The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The project‚Äôs 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.
For more information on Shalag Industries, go to: <http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html>http://www.shalag.co.il/home.html.† For information on company job opportunities, visit the Employment Security Commission office at 518 Lewis St., Oxford, N.C., 27565, or call the office at 919-693-2686.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:
To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.
The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ‚Äì and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ‚Äì it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.
By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†
To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ‚Äúvaccine locator.‚Äù† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the state‚Äôs application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.
‚ÄúThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,‚Äù said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ‚ÄúThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.‚Äù
The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

APPLEGATE ADDENDUM-FT. LAUDERDALE


FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT HARASSMENT:


CITY AUTO VIN NUMBERS W/D.A. & MORE INFO PROOF:

on october 6, 2009, @ 1:30 p.nm-2:00 p.m., e.s.t., i was riding a bike in the bike lane in ft. lauderdale, fl, and a white van with an african-american male, hit me (again) and slightly injured my left elbow and two fingers (at this moment, i will see how it is tomorrow).


D.A. VIN ON AUTO THAT HIT ME PROOF:

1) i-fbne3-(il-"illinois, president obama")-s-6-da, "district attorney")-20-8-3:

2) AUTO TAG P393DP (POLICE-393-DP-DEPARTMENT)

3) EDDIE E. (55-again) HILL (Illinois/ILL again), 2890 (u-it-i-15); N.W. 10TH (10 AGAIN) COURT, FT. LAUDERDALE, FL 33311, D.O.B. 3-6-39 (363-i).

4) ALLSTATE INSURANCE POLICY #941174520, expires 11/20, d.l. # (H400-212-39(SIMILAR TO AUTO TAG)0860).

AUTO TAG P393DP ‚Äú39‚Äù LIKE WHAT I STATED ON THE PHONE A FEW MINUTES EARLIER REGARDING A BANK AND "THE CLUB" ISSUES EARLIER.

FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE OFFICER LOCKETT (ETT AGAIN) GAVE ME 2 CARDS WITH A POLICE CASE #09-109875.

THIS PATTERN OF BEING HIT BY AUTOS WHILE IN THE BIKE LANE IS ALREADY DOCUMENTED BY ME AND WITH THE FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND IT IS ATROOCIOUS THAT IT CONTINUALLY HAPPENS TO ME DUE TO SOMEONE'S "CUES" AS ONE BAD FALL, I COULD FALL AND HIT MY HEAD ON THE CURB OR WORSE.

THIS IS A DISGRACE ON THE U.S.A. AND THEIR PATRONIZING BEHAVIOUR WITH THE PARAMEDICS AND HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BLAME ME BY ASKING MEDICAL ISSUES AND MEDICATION NOT PERTAINING TO THE SPECIFIC INCIDENT WHERE THE DRIVER ACKNOWLEDGED TO ME WHILE WAITING FOR THE POLICE THAT HE IS IN THE WRONG (WHO KNOWS WHAT HE SAID TO THE POLICE BECAUSE AS USUAL, THE PARAMEDICS HAULED ME IN TOO FAST INTO THE AMBULANCE BEFORE I COULD SEE WHAT THEY DID OR DID NOT DO, LIKE WITH RICARDO RODRIGUEZ EATING THE TIP OF MY RIGHT THUMB IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIRTHDAY, AUGUST 4, 2006.)

THE FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE STATION THEN PATRONIZED ME BY HONKING THEIR HORN WITH A "SECURITY" CITY VEHICLE LIKE NATIONAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS SINCE 2001 AS THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT AND THEY LYINGLY, I REPEAT, LYINGLY SUGGEST IT IS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR VIDEO AND AUDIO SURVEILLANCE OF ME INSIDE MY RESIDENCES WHEN I DO THESE 4 THINGS SPECIFICALLY, ASIDE FROM WHEN A T.V. CHARACTER ON "LAW AND ORDER" STATES SOMETHING LEGAL OR THE COMMENT "ATTORNEY GENERAL" AND MY ROOM MATE COUGHS 3-TIMES.

1. THE PRECISE SECOND THAT I GRAB THE TOILET PAPER AFTER DEFACATION.
2. THE PRECISE SECOND THAT I GRAB MY PENIS TO URINATE, OR THE OTHER.
3. THE PRECISE SECOND THAT I GRAB MY UNDERWEAR TO CHANGE CLOTHES.
4. THE PRECISE SECOND THAT I OPEN MY EYES, AND THIS INCLUDES POLICE SIRENS AND TRAINS.


ON OCTOBER 13, 2009, 4:35 p.m., e.s.t., FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE OFFICER  SANDMAN , #1709, LIED ABOUT STOPPING ME ON BROWARD BLVD NEAR BURGER KING STATING THAT I ‚ÄúMADE A HAND GESTURE LIKE A GUN TOWARDS HIM.‚Äù (MY THUMB, THE ONE THAT I HAD SURGERY ON WAS HURTING) THEN, HE TOOK THE BIKE FOR ME NOT HAVING ON-PERSON A CITY BIKE REGISTRATION TICKET, #19444, AND HIS SERGEANTS CALLED ME BACK, YET BLEW ME OFF. THEY STATED IF I WAS WALKING, THEN ‚ÄúNOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED‚Äù FALSE CLAIM AS THE HARASSMENT STILL WOULD HAVE.
	
NOTE: THE BIKE WAS ILLEGALLY CONFISCATED DUE TO THE CITY ORDINANCE THAT REGISTRATION FOR BIKES ARE OPTIONAL FOR NON-RESIDENTS AND I PRESENTED AN STATE OF ALASKA ID WHERE I AM A RESIDENT OF. THUS, CONTARY TO OFFICER SANDMAN‚ÄôS SGT., THE BIKE WAS ILLEGALLY CONFISCATED.

1.	‚ÄúGUN‚Äù INITIAL STATEMENT BY POLICE AGAIN.
2.	‚ÄúARREST" INITIAL STATEMENT BY POLICE AGAIN.

HERE ARE THE ISSUES:

1.	SANDMAN WAS PREPARED FOR HIS COMMENTS AS HE YELLED THAT ABSURD ‚ÄúPERCEPTION‚Äù AHEAD OF TIME ALREADY KNOWING (I DID NOT) THAT IF I HAD NO STICKER ON THE BIKE, THAT HE COULD LEGALLY CONFISCATE IT.
2.	FALSE AS THE ORDINANCE IS ‚ÄúOPTIONAL‚Äù FOR NON-RESIDENTS AND I GAVE HIM MY STATE OF ALASKA IDENTIFICATION CARD.
3.	THE NEXT PHASE OF FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE HARASSMENT IS TO LOOK FOR ANY PETTY REASON TO STOP ME AND THREATEN ME WITH ARREST.
4.	THERE WAS ZERO CHANCE IMMEDIATELY TO DEAL WITH THESE OFFICERS (THE OTHER 2 TOO) AS THEY WERE IN OVERT AGGRESSIVE, PRE-MEDITATED PLAN DUE TO MY PREVIOUS WEEKS HERE WHEN NOT ONE OF THEM STOPPED ME.
5.	ATTEMPTED SLANDER AGAIN WITH INITIAL STATEMENT THAT A POLICE OFFICER ‚ÄúTHOUGHT‚Äù THAT I HAD A ‚ÄúGUN‚Äù (AGAIN) EXCUSE TO HARASS ME. IN FACT, MY LEFT THUMB, SURGICALLY REPAIRED IS INJURED AND THE TIP OF MY RIGHT THUMB IS GONE, BOTH DUE IN PART (OR MORE) TO FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE CORRUPTION.
6.	ARREST THREAT (AGAIN) IF I DID NOT SIGN THE TICKET FOR A $1 REGISTRATION FEE FOR BIKES THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF. OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE A TARGET ‚ÄúX‚Äù ON ME AS SANDMAN‚ÄôS SERGEANT STATED THAT IF I WAS WALKING, THEN NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
7.	president obama: the issues in ft. lauderdale with some, not all, of their police antagonistic and hostility towards me is noted below. I HAVE MY LEGAL DECISIONS MADE WITH ME AND MY ATTORNEY ADAM BARTLETT, NOT CITY/STATE/FEDERAL ATTORNEYS UNLESS IT COMES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ITSELF. NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND ON THIS FOR SEVERAL REASONS.
8.	ft. lauderdale police due to their harassment. the incident noted below, is absurd as this is the u.s.a. and police intimidation/threats like in los angeles, kenai, alaska, ft. lauderdale and other cities connected to "applegate" officers have illegally stated that "I CANNOT LIVE IN 'THEIR' CITY." the main corrupt lauderdale officer sandman even pushed me down like officer lade and atrociously stated to me "what are you going to do about me taking the bike. i would like to see that." i responded "legally and writing to the attorney general." sandman also lyingly and corruptly stated: "don't you know not to point your hand like a gun at a police officer." GUN MENTIONED AGAIN WITH THREAT OF ARREST.
9.	naturally, it is up to me to gain employment as my finances are minimal due to the corruption (background checks) and its cover-up that prevents me from monetary and other compensation for their multitude of state and federal crimes.
10.	the lauderdale officers today seemed homophobic, and even racist against both gays and blacks (even the latin sheriff) as this is most of their common denominators over the years and you probably will find this to be quite consistent when researching their career histories.
11.	once they start, they continue and become worse. they have zero fear of the feds, so are they part of it?

ON OCTOBER 11, 2009, AT TARGET, FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE AND ‚ÄûTHE USUAL‚Äú DONE EXCESSIVELY AND EXTREME, ‚ÄûCUES‚Äú THAT ARE FULL OF OMISSIONS, PARTIAL TRUTH, AND ABSOLUTE LIES, WITHOUT THE CORRUPT POLICE AND FEDERAL ATROCITIES, AND ATTEMPTS TO COMMUNICATE ‚ÄûAPPLEGATE‚Äú COVER-UP 4th, 6th & 7TH BILL OF RIGHTS AMENDMENTS VIOLATIONS (MY PERSONAL ATTORNEY PRESENT BOTH BEFORE A JUDGE TO CHALLENGE ANYTHING STATED AND/OR OMITTED, PERJURY, ETC...) ‚ÄûLOOK-A-LIKES‚Äú, TO EXACERBATE 
‚ÄûINTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS‚Äú
P.T.S.D. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COVER-UP.

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2009, ‚ÄúTHE USUAL‚Äù, AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BELOW, I WILL NOT ACCEPT THEIR EXTREMELY ONE-SIDED VERSION OF ‚ÄúAPPLEGATE‚Äù AND ITS COVER-UP, UNCHALLENGED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE WITH ME AND MY ATTORNEY PRESENT, DUE TO THE MULTIPLE CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS, LAW ENFORCEMENT OMISSIONS OF THEIR POLICE AND FEDERAL CRIMES & WITHHOLDING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE, ‚ÄúCHERRY PICKING‚Äù A FRAGMENTARY PART OF MY LIFE THAT (IRONICALLY I NEED ‚ÄúIT‚Äù TO PROVE THAT THEY ENTRAPPED AND ATTEMPTED ENTRAPMENT WITH SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL SET-UPS, BY COMING TO ME FIRST AND SUGGESTING ON THEIR OWN TO PAY FOR SEX WITH CHILDREN) IS THEIR EXCUSE 4 EVERYTHING, INCLUDING A MALE THREATENING ME ON BROWARD BLVD. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BUS STATION WHERE THERE IS A FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE MALE OFFICER EYEWITNESS DUE TO THE ‚ÄúBOGUS‚Äù COLLISION WITH A ‚ÄúTAXI‚Äù THAT THEY ALWAYS USE AND SLANDERED ME ON THAT THEY OPENLY NOW DO (THAT THE POLICE/FEDS ARE UTILIZING WITH CITY/COUNTY VEH!
 ICLES AND OTHER VEHICLES, AGAIN, WITH ‚ÄúAUTO CUES‚Äù THAT ARE EXTREMELY ONE-SIDED).

4TH, 6TH, & 7TH BILL OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, MY ATTORNEY PRESENT, INVASION OF PRIVACY TORTS, NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (DUE TO PRE-PLANNED AND PRE-KNOWLEDGE OF MY REACTIONS THAT I MUST DO SO THAT THE PUBLIC SEES WHAT THEY ARE DOING), AND SEVERAL OTHER FEDERAL LAWS BEING BROKEN AND THEIR LIES THAT IT INVOLVED ‚ÄúHEALTH CARE‚Äù AS IN 2001 WHEN I WENT INTO SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK, THE POLICE/FEDS DID NOT CONTACT MY PARENTS AND ATTACKED ME, PERIOD. IF THEY DENY IT, THEY ARE LYING.

FEDERAL VEHICLES IN CROSSING PATTERNS. THEY DO THIS, DENY IT, SLANDER ME ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE FILMING ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.
AS USUAL, HERE THE PROBLEMS:
1.    APPLEGATE COVER-UP WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY (6TH & 7th AMENDMENDMENT VIOLATIONS).
2.    4TH AMENDMENT (DUE PROCESS) VIOLATIONS.
3.    INVASION OF PRIVACY TORTS. POLICE AND FEDERAL VEHICLES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES, ETC‚Ä¶.
4.    INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS BY THE AUTO CUES AND INSIDE SURRVEILLANCE ‚ÄúBOGUS‚Äù SUGGESTIONS WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY.
5.    2001 NO ‚ÄúNEXT FRIEND‚Äù FEDERAL LAW DONE (MY PARENTS) WHEN I WENT INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK, MAKING EVERYTHING SINCE THEN UNCONSTITUTIONAL, ILLEGAL, AND INADMISSABLE.
6.     2001-2009 AND CONTINUING: POLICE AND FEDERAL ATROCITIES COVER-UP (NO ‚ÄúSWAP‚Äù AS THAT WOULD BE LIKE GIVING THE CORRUPT POLICE AND FEDS $1,000 LEGAL DOLLARS FOR EVERY $1 LEGAL DOLLAR).
7.    POLICE AND FEDERAL DEFAMATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE SLANDER ON ‚ÄúMENTAL HEALTH‚Äù, WHEN THEY OVERTLY DO IN PUBLIC WHAT I ALWAYS HAVE STATED THAT THEY DO SINCE 2001 THAT THEY SLANDERED ME ON AND WHAT MAKES IT MORE ATROCIOUS, IS THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN, PRE-MEDITATED, INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS BY CONTINUING FOLLOWING ME WITH EXTREME AND EXCESSIVE ABNORMAL STIMULI SIMULTANEOUSLY, AVOIDING MY ATTORNEY WHILE THEIR ‚ÄúCUES‚Äù ARE STILL EXTREMELY ONE-SIDED, MUCH DECEIT AND DUPLICITY DUE TO MULTIPLE OMISSIONS, AND MORE TO BE DISCUSSED IN PERSON.
8.    ‚ÄúAIR CONDITION‚Äù LIES DUE TO ATTORNEY-DIRECTED PLANNED INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AS THEY PRE-KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSES WILL BE TO THEIR ACTIONS ARE WILFULLY EXACERBATING ANY AND ALL P.T.S.D. AND ANXIETY DISORDERS DUE TO ACTIONS THAT NO HUMAN BEING, AFTER 8 ¬Ω YEARS, 24/7, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SURVEILLANCE, COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY COPE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE TECHNIQUES NOW MODIFIED TO A FORM OF ‚ÄúUNOFFICIAL‚Äù COMMUNICATION.

Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33301


Subject:        Ft. Lauderdale Police Department Harassment/Corruption


Dear Mayor Seiler:     


This letter is to address a recent incident with the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department, specifically an incident with Officer Sandman, I.S.P. 1709, on an incident yesterday, the 13th of October, 2009, and I will list a few prior experiences that have occurred with your department that I have documented with my attorney and some members of Congress that received 2004 ‚ÄúLetter for Investigative Purposes‚Äù: releases from me to follow up on these matters.

First, this is o summarize the incident of initial harassment and threats of arrest again yesterday with the obvious statement that any city, state, or federal law should be followed (even if unknown like I was since I recently moved here from Alaska and the person resident who loaned me her bicycle):

APPLEGATE ADDENDUM-FT. LAUDERDALE


FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT HARASSMENT:


ON OCTOBER 13, 2009, 4:35 p.m., E.S.T., FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE OFFICER SANDMAN , #1709, LIED ABOUT STOPPING ME ON BROWARD BLVD NEAR BURGER KING STATING THAT I ‚ÄúMADE A HAND GESTURE LIKE A GUN TOWARDS HIM.‚Äù (MY THUMB, THE ONE THAT I HAD SURGERY ON WAS HURTING) THEN, HE TOOK THE BIKE FOR ME NOT HAVING ON-PERSON A CITY BIKE REGISTRATION TICKET, #19444, AND HIS SERGEANTS CALLED ME BACK, YET BLEW ME OFF. THEY STATED IF I WAS WALKING, THEN ‚ÄúNOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED‚Äù FALSE CLAIM AS THE HARASSMENT STILL WOULD HAVE.

1.    ‚ÄúGUN‚Äù INITIAL STATEMENT BY POLICE AGAIN.
2.    ‚ÄúARREST" INITIAL STATEMENT BY POLICE AGAIN.

HERE ARE THE ISSUES:

1.    SANDMAN WAS PREPARED FOR HIS COMMENTS AS HE YELLED THAT ABSURD ‚ÄúPERCEPTION‚Äù AHEAD OF TIME ALREADY KNOWING (I DID NOT) THAT IF I HAD NO STICKER ON THE BIKE, THAT HE COULD LEGALLY CONFISCATE IT.

2.    THE NEXT PHASE OF FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE HARASSMENT IS TO LOOK FOR ANY PETTY REASON TO STOP ME AND THREATEN ME WITH ARREST.

3.    THERE WAS ZERO CHANCE IMMEDIATELY TO DEAL WITH THESE OFFICERS (THE OTHER 2 TOO) AS THEY WERE IN OVERT AGGRESSIVE, PRE-MEDITATED PLAN DUE TO MY PREVIOUS WEEKS HERE WHEN NOT ONE OF THEM STOPPED ME.

4.    ATTEMPTED SLANDER AGAIN WITH INITIAL STATEMENT THAT A POLICE OFFICER ‚ÄúTHOUGHT‚Äù THAT I HAD A ‚ÄúGUN‚Äù (AGAIN) EXCUSE TO HARASS ME. IN FACT, MY LEFT THUMB, SURGERICALLY REPAIRED IS INJURED AND THE TIP OF MY RIGHT THUMB IS GONE, BOTH DUE IN PART (OR MORE) TO FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE CORRUPTION.

5.    ARREST THREAT (AGAIN) IF I DID NOT SIGN THE TICKET (I WANTED TO READ IT BEFORE I SIGNED ANYTHING AND I DID NOT HAVE MY GLASSES) FOR A $1 REGISTRATION FEE FOR BIKES THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF INCLUDING THE SUBSEQUENT $10 FINE THAT DIVERTS ATTENTION FOR WHY OFFICER SANDMAN LIED ABOUT THE INITIAL STOP. OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE A TARGET ‚ÄúX‚Äù ON ME AS SANDMAN‚ÄôS SERGEANT STATED THAT IF I WAS WALKING, THEN NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

This has been a continued pattern that ties in other national police departments and I will list 3 incidents that occured with the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department and their Internal Affairs that specifically pertain to your jurisdiction:

1.    December 24, 2003, I was attacked by two thugs and their female friend kept asking me to purchase their jacket that I kept refusing and the Ft. Lauderdale Police cover-up due to lies and omissions in their police report (‚Äûincident  report‚Äú) that included ‚ÄûMike‚Äú, a possible off-duty officer as one uniformed officer asked him: ‚ÄûMike, are you off-duty and do you wish to be ‚Äöofficially‚Äò in this report‚Äú that I was not aware was an option for law enforcement being eyewitnesses to crimes, even if ‚Äûoff-duty‚Äú) as I needed the documentation for civil litigation purposes due to my injuries, especially my teeth.


2.     My younger brother Lonnie was hit by a train and was unexpectedly killed Friday, January 23, 2004, exactly 3 weeks after our grandfather who, ironically, worked 30 years on the Alaska railroad as an electrical engineer. It is bizarre that my 3 closet relatives in my immediate family all died on Fridays in the month of January.  Just after hearing about Lonnie‚Äôs tragic death at work, I was attacked by two thugs and the Ft. Lauderdale Police lied about the weapons that were used against me that I personally retrieved and gave to one officer (I thought that is police work, not victim work) who sealed them in a plastic bag and put into the trunk of his patrol car. The weapons were left out of the police reports and the paperwork ‚Äûsuspect‚Äú paragraph left blank on the ‚Äûincident report‚Äú and obviously, the weapons, evidence with perhaps fingerprints of one of the assailants, were discarded. These are all cover-ups as I need the documentation for civil litigation pur!
 poses (even those that may not necessarily be associated with them) due to my physical and psychological injuries and its punitive damages. This situation became worse with the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department Internal Affairs escalation of the corrupt cover-up, totally dismissed me in their letters and refused to do any  ‚Äûsupplementary forms‚Äú to correct the police reports with overt lies and omissions that the Florida State prosecutor requested needed to be done in order to possibly proceed with charges. Unbelievable, after these crimes by the police, I left a message on the F.B.I. website and within seconds, I received two calls from a male claiming to be from the F.B.I. warning me about making ‚Äúfalse crime tips‚Äù on their website. When he refused to give me his name, I refused to speak to him on the first call. He called a second time and I refused to answer and told my friend to tell him to come and discuss it in person. He never did.

3. August 4, 2006, in Wilton Manors, yet the Ft. Lauderdale Police showed up, a ‚Äûthing‚Äú, Ricardo Rodriguez, unprovoked attacked me and eventually ate the tip of my right thumb.

4. August 6, 2009, the day following surgery, in ‚Äöshock‚Äú over my thumb being eaten and coming off the anesthesia, the Ft. Lauderdale Police harassed me on Las Olas Blvd, a young attractive officer pushed me in the back after permitting me to go, then realizing that there were many eyewitnesses, followed me with 4 police vehicles towards the city public library sidewalk (taxpayer funded, not private property, so no trespassing) approached me and they stated that I ‚Äûhad to go home or go to jail‚Äú and I replied that it is illegal, they can only request that I leave the area, so they arrested me for ‚Äûtrespassing‚Äú (on the city public sidewalk, taxpayer funded, not private property, so no trespassing), beat me while handcuffed behind my back, several times pounding me in the chest as I was defenseless, due to telling them that I was going to call the F.B.I. on them for federal civil rights violations. On the way to the hospital for medical ‚Äûclearance‚Äú to go to jail !
 as my right thumb was still bleeding and H.I.V., the officer driving stated: ‚ÄûI should just kick your ass now so that you can sue the police department and we can split the money‚Äú and ‚ÄûYou will not be helped due to being politicized.‚Äú There own police audio and video can prove what I have written. I did call the Florida F.B.I., but the female that I spoke to blew me off claiming it was ‚Äûnot their jurisdiction‚Äú that I would love to legally challenge.



Any further explanations, or the specific police reports, may easily be obtained from the Internal Affairs & Records office as I have all of these at my attorney‚Äôs office and in Switzerland where I previously resided for years.

I will cc my attorney, the State of Florida Attorney General, Congressmen Waxman (California), Congressman Young (Alaska whom my 1st cousin is employed by), Senators Boxer (California), McCain (Arizona), Murkowski (Alaska), and then Senator Obama, now President of the U.S.A.), all of whom  have been communicating with over several years regarding the police and federal corruption that I have experienced and all of their offices have this issue among others documented with responses from Senators Boxer and McCain: This reason for this is due to all of these States, with the exception of Arizona, yet I required an outside Senator to also possibly review the legal issues involved.


Please look into these very serious issues raised.



Sincerely,

OCTOBER 3, 2009:

attorney-client privleged info: applegate addendum


ADAM:

HERE ARE THE EVENTS, GENERALLY DESCRIBED, OCTOBER 2-3, BETWEEN 11:00 P.M. E.S.T. AND 2:00 P.M. E.S.T.

1. THE CLUB GAY BATH HOUSE WITH THEIR LATIN EMPLOYEE ERIC, MY PREVIOUS LANDLORD, WHO PREIVOUSLY PULLED A KNIFE TO MY THROAT AND THREATENED TO MURDER ME IN 2007. NATURALLY, NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT AND HE DENIED DOING THAT (LIKE KENAI POLICE OFFICE LANGSELF ON MAY 18, 2009.)

2. I CRASHED ON THE BIKE WHEN I WENT THERE, WHICH WILL BE THE LAST TIME FOR VARIOUS REASONS, ESPECIALLY THAT ERIC (WHO MAY BE AN UNDERCOVER CORRUPT COP WHO I LIVED AT HIS HOUSE AND THERE ARE ISSUES THERE IN ADDITION TO THEM BEING CALLOUS ABOUT MY YOUNGER BROTHER LONNIE'S DEATH). THIS TIES IN PREVIOUS ENTRAPMENTS ON "PETTY STUFF" AS YEARS AGO, HE DROVE ME THERE ON HIS OWN SUGGESTION. THERE IS MORE TO REPORT ON THIS LATER, EVEN MORE THAN ALREADY STATED BY THEM UTILIZING MUSIC AS COUNTER INTELLIGENCE TARGETING ME, SO THERE IS MORE PROOF.

3. STINGS WITH TARGETED SURVEILLANCE AND FOLLOWING ME AROUND, INCLUDING THE F.B.I. FORMER "CARNIVORE" COMPTER INFILTRATION THAT "COINCIDENTALLY" CRASHED A FEW MOMENTS AGO, YET NOW IS FINE.

4. "THE USUAL", YET THEIR PSYCHE GAMES NO LONGER AFFECT ME.

5. MY CELL NOW "COINICIDENTALLY" BEEPS, WHEN IT DID NOT PRIOR TO THIS VISIT. WHAT LEGAL BASIS ARE THEY USING TO LISTEN IN TO THE TELEPHONE (THAT IS IN IRA G. JONES AND ERICK SOWERS NAME)? THIS WILL BE CHALLENGED AS I HAVE MOR DETAILED INFO TO BE SHARED THAT WLL TIE ERIC AND THE "CLUB" INTO PREVIOUS PSYCHE WARFARE THAT IS NOW TOTALLY VERFIED.

6. MY CALLS TO YOUR OFFICE ARE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVLEDGE. IS IS ALL CONNECTED TO THE 2 "BOGUS" A.P.D. TICKETS "ENTRAPMENT" FROM 2001-2001.

7. "AUTO CUES" WITHOUT 4TH, 6TH, & 7TH BILL OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS DUE TO PLANNED, PRE-MEDITATED, ACTIONS THAT THE POLICE/FEDS SLANDERED ME ON AND THEIR ATTORNEYS WITHHOLDING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

8. THE "APPLEGATE" AND COVER-UP IS EXTREMELY ONE SIDED, OMISSIONS OF THEIR CRIMES AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS COVER-UP, THEIR POLICE, FEDERAL, AND DIPLOMAT SECRETS THAT INITIALLY WERE UTILIZED AGAINST ME IN 1989, 1990;S, 2001 AND BEYOND (THAT THE SUGGESTIONS IS THAT IT IS REVERSED, BUT THAT IS ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE), THEIR POWER AND AUTHORITY AND THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIMES THAT THEY COMMITTED, MAKES THEIR "AUTO CUES" SUGGESTION OF A "SWAP" ABSURD. THE POLICE FOLLOWING ME BACK TO THE HOUSE IS EGREGIOUS AS I WILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT AND PROVE WHAT THEY DID FOR MANY YEARS DESPITE THEIR PSYCHE GAMES OF THREATS. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PRESIDENT NOW, SO THAT IS WHY THEY WERE NOT AS EVIL AS THEY PREVIOUSLY WERE.

9. THEIR "MUSIC" CUES IS "I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO." THIS WILL BE FOUGHT. I WILL NEVER LET THEM GO.

10. ADAM, THIS CORRUPT COPS ARE CONNECTED AND IT INCLUDES FEDERAL CRIMES. ON THE SAME DEFAMATIONS, THIS GOES TO 1987 IN ANCHORAGE POLICE DEPARTEMT AND SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION, 1988 IN HUNTINTON BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENTS, 1989 WHEN WEST HOLLYWOOD SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT AND L.A.P.D. STARTED PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE THAT CONTINUES THROUGH THE 1990'S, AND EXPONENTIALLY BECAME WORSE IN 2001. IT INCLUDES THE F.B.I. IRAQ U.N. RESOLUTION 1441 UNDER BUSH.

11. I NEEDED THAT FOR REASONS TO BE DISCLOSED LATER.

12. TRUST ME ADAM. I LIVED IT, AND WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, THERE ARE DIIFERENT FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND LIKE EVERYWHERE, THEY NEED TO SEE IT FOR THEMSELVES.

13. THE INSIDE SURVEILLANCE, IF THE FEDS DID IT, WILL PROVE TO BE QUITE INTERESTING AND IN MY BENEFIT SINCE THEY SLANDERED ME ON WHAT THEY DO. PEBBLES FOR THE NUKES.

14. THERE IS MUCH MORE INFO 2 BE SHARED LATER AS I WISH TO CATCH THEM IN MORE PERJURY AND TO CLEAR THE DEFAMATIONS OF WHAT THEY DID AND STILL DO. THEY ARE EASILY BAITED EVEN AS THEY ATEMPT TO BAIT ME. 

15. CIVIL LITIGATION PURPOSES, AT LEAST HISTORIES AND LEGACIES, AND WHEN I HAVE A PUBLIC FORUM, THEY WILL HAVE MORE EGGS ON THEIR FACES.

16. I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING AS I LIVED IT IN MULTIPLE CITIES, STATES, AND NATIONS. 

17. WHEN WE MEET, OR A DESIGNATED AUTHORITY DIRECTLY STATED BY YOU, WE WILL PROCEED AND LEGALLY CHALLENGE. EVERYTHING.

APPLEGATE ADDENDUM-FT. LAUDERDALE


choice is made as i will not "swap" my life versus the corrupt police and federal atrocities on "applegate" due to the following: 
1. constitutional issues galore-principle
2. their power and authority
3. the severity of what was done
4. histories and legacies remembered forever


ON SEPTMEBER 28, 2009, @ 12:00 P.M., E.S.T., I TRAVELLED ON THE FT. LAUDERDALE BUS FROM ADECCO TEMP AGENCY TO MARRIOT FOR EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES (ON ANDREWS BLVD. WHERE THEY HAD A LOOK-A-LIKE OF THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED THE SERIAL KILLER IN THE FILM ‚ÄúSILENCE OF THE LAMBS‚Äù NEXT TO A YOUNG WHITE MALE IN A WHITE T-SHIRT), AND THE ‚ÄúSET-UPS‚Äù OF THE AUTO CUES (AND THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ‚ÄúCHERRY PICK‚Äù MY LIFE, MULTIPLE OMISSIONS OF POLICE AND FEDERAL ATROCITIES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS INCLUDING ENTRAPMENT AND WORSE), TRAFFIC WITH CITY MUNICIPAL VEHICLES AND ALWAYS ADJOINING WHITE AUTOS WITH FT. LAUDERALE POLICE AUTOS (ABSURD), ETC‚Ä¶, ‚ÄúTHE USUAL‚Äù, THAT PREVIOUSLY THE POLICE, FEDS, AND PSYCHIATRISTS AT SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION SLANDERED ME ON THAT IS NOW DONE OPENLY THAT ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC COULD OBSERVE, WITH POLICE AND FED-EX, U.P.S., U.S.P.S., INCLUDING THE SUGGESTION THAT IT WAS FOR MEDICAL (CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS AGAIN DUE TO 2001 THE POLI!
 CE AND FEDS DID NOT CONTACT MY PARENTS WHEN I WENT INTO SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK), INSTEAD, THEY ATTACKED ME AND IF THEY DENY IT, THEY ARE LYING AS ‚ÄúAPPLEGATE‚Äù STARTED MUCH EARLIER THAN THEY ADMIT AND THE  POLICE AND FEDERAL ATTORNEYS ARE WITHHOLDING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE TO PROVE WHAT I AM WRITING AND SAYING, PERIOD.


ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2009, THE ‚ÄùUSUAL‚Äù WITH MULTIPLE POLICE AND FEDERAL  ROAD ‚ÄúCOACH‚Äù ‚ÄúAUTO CUES‚Äù AND OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS SUGGESTING ABSOLUTE LIES, WITH HALF-TRUTHS, PARTIAL TRUTHS, 24/7 SURVEILLANCE, AND TIMED AUTO TRAFFIC WITH CITY AND FEDERAL VEHICLES IN CROSSING PATTERNS. THEY DO THIS, DENY IT, SLANDER ME ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE FILMING ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

AS USUAL, HERE THE PROBLEMS:

1.    APPLEGATE COVER-UP WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY (4TH, 6TH & 7th AMENDMENT VIOLATIONS).
2.    4TH AMENDMENT (DUE PROCESS) VIOLATIONS.
3.    INVASION OF PRIVACY TORTS. POLICE AND FEDERAL VEHICLES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES, ETC‚Ä¶.
4.    INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS BY THE AUTO CUES AND INSIDE SURVEILLANCE ‚ÄúBOGUS‚Äù SUGGESTIONS WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY.
5.    2001 NO ‚ÄúNEXT FRIEND‚Äù FEDERAL DONE (MY PARENTS) WHEN I WENT INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK, MAKING EVERYTHING SINCE THEN UNCONSTITUTIONAL, ILLEGAL, AND INADMISSABLE.
6.     2001-2009 AND CONTINUING: POLICE AND FEDERAL ATROCITIES COVER-UP (NO ‚ÄúSWAP‚Äù AS THAT WOULD BE LIKE GIVING THE CORRUPT POLICE AND FEDS $1,000 LEGAL DOLLARS FOR EVERY $1 LEGAL DOLLAR).
7.    POLICE AND FEDERAL DEFAMATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE SLANDER ON ‚ÄúMENTAL HEALTH‚Äù, WHEN THEY OVERTLY DO IN PUBLIC WHAT I ALWAYS HAVE STATED THAT THEY DO SINCE 2001 THAT THEY SLANDERED ME ON AND WHAT MAKES IT MORE ATROCIOUS, IS THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN, PRE-MEDITATED, INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS BY CONTINUING FOLLOWING ME WITH EXTREME AND EXCESSIVE ABNORMAL STIMULI SIMULTANEOUSLY, AVOIDING MY ATTORNEY WHILE THEIR ‚ÄúCUES‚Äù ARE STILL EXTREMELY ONE-SIDED, MUCH DECEIT AND DUPLICITY DUE TO MULTIPLE OMISSIONS, AND MORE TO BE DISCUSSED IN PERSON.
8.    ‚ÄúAIR CONDITION‚Äù LIES DUE TO ATTORNEY-DIRECTED PLANNED INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AS THEY PRE-KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSES WILL BE TO THEIR ACTIONS ARE WILFULLY EXACERBATING ANY AND ALL P.T.S.D. AND ANXIETY DISORDERS DUE TO ACTIONS THAT NO HUMAN BEING, AFTER 8 ¬Ω YEARS, 24/7, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SURVEILLANCE, COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY COPE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE TECHNIQUES NOW MODIFIED TO A FORM OF ‚ÄúUNOFFICIAL‚Äù COMMUNICATION.



September 25, 2009

‚ÄúThe Usual‚Äù between 5:00-6:00 p.m. after walking back from the beach

On the way there, it was pretty calm, yet as the bozo ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, they can never let something that works be, they are violating U.S.A. Constitutional Laws and Bill of Rights, especially the 4th, 6th & 7th Amendments and atrociously suggest that ‚Äúit is for me‚Äù and ‚Äúchecks‚Äù, yet if it truly were, they would contact me in person with an attorney present for me. There are ‚Äúauto cues‚Äù by police and federal vehicles, etc‚Ä¶that are extremely one-sided, despite the principle of circumventing U.S.A. Constitutional Bill of Rights and several other Federal Laws and again, they now openly do what they previously denied and slandered me on THAT THEY ALSO DID INSIDE.


Here are the issues with their bizarre comparisons:

‚Ä¢    THE POLICE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES POWER AND THE SEVERITY OF WHAT THEY DID TO ME COMPARED TO ‚ÄúPETTY STUFF‚Äù THAT THEY ALLOWED IN HOPES TO PROCURE CONFESSIONS TO WHAT I DID NOT DO (THAT I HEARD THROUGH
THE GRAPEVINE, THAT I WAS FRAMED FOR) AND NUMEROUS UNSUCCESSFUL SET-UPS WITH ME AND BOYS ALONE IN MULTIPLE CITIES, STATES, AND ONCE EVEN IN SWITZERLAND WITH MULTIPLE CITY, STATE AND FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS/AGENCIES AND THEIR ATTEMPTED ENTRAPMENTS AND ENTRAPMENTS.
‚Ä¢    CIRCUMVENTING CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY AS I HAVE ALREADY MADE MY CHOICE OF INVOKING USA CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OF HAVING MY OWN ATTORNEY.
‚Ä¢    NEGLIGENT INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS PLANNED BY ATTORNEYS FOR THE POLICE, FEDS, AND PERHAPS A.G. ERIC HOLDER. THE DEMOCRATS USED TO BLAME IT ALL ON FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH. 
‚Ä¢    PRIVACY ACT VIOLATIONS.
‚Ä¢    APPLEGATE COVER-UP.
‚Ä¢    I NEED DOCUMENTED PROOF OF ANY CORRUPTION ‚ÄúFIXED‚Äù.
‚Ä¢    A.C.L.U., SEYMOUR HERSH, AND THOMAS GOTTSHALK THAT I WILL SPEAK TO WHEN I EVENTUALLY HAVE A PUBLIC FORUM.

September 25, 2009


    THE GREATEST LIARS AND HYPOCRITES IN U.S.A. HISTORY: WHY?

1) POLICE AND FEDERAL CORRUPTION-APPLEGATE COVER-UP (TOO MANY TO LIST AND THERE IS NO COMPARISON DUE TO THEIR AUTHORITY AND THE SEVERITY OF THEIR CRIMES). PLUS, THE POLICE AND FEDERAL ATTORNEYS ARE WITHHOLDING EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE TO PROVE WHAT I WRITE. DOCUMENT IT AS THEY WILL BE PROVEN IN MORE PERJURY (LYING IN SWORN AFFIDAVITS AND UNDER OATH IN A COURT OF LAW).

2) INTENTIONAL/NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS DUE TO EXCESSIVE & EXTREME ABNORMAL STIMULI SIMULTANEOUSLY CIRCUMVENTING AND CIRCUMVENTED U.S.A. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW/BILL OF RIGHTS/CIVIL LITIGATION AND/OR COMPENSATION FOR CONSTITUTIONAL TORTS.

3) CONTINUALLY CHANGING "EXCUSES" FOR NOT MAKING COMPENSATION FOR MULTIPLE POLICE AND FEDERAL CRIMES THAT ARE MANY TIMES WORSE THAN RODNEY KING, WHO DESPITE HIS LIFE STRUGGLES AND MENTAL HEALTH, DESERVED THE COMPENSATION FOR WHAT WAS DONE TO HIM.

NOTE: I AM NOT RODNEY KING, AND PHYSICIANS AND PSYCHIATRISTS (CONNECTION 2 SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION‚ÄôS DR. LARRY TAYLOR AND OTHERS IN THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPT) HAVE LIED ABOUT ME AND PERJURED THEMSELVES IN POLICE AND FEDERAL DOCUMENTS IN COLLUSIONS WITH CORRUPT POLICE AND FEDERAL AGNCIES.

4) DOES THE U.S.A. ECONOMIC LEADERS AND WORLD LEADERS HAVE THE "MENTAL HEALTH" TO HANDLE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY DUE TO THE U.S.A. & WORLD RECESSION AND HUGE DEFICITS?

5) NORMAL, BALANCED HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS RESPOND WELL TO NORMAL, BALANCED HEALTHY STIMULI. EXCESSIVE AND EXTREME ABNORMAL STIMULI 24/7 IS ABNORMAL AND NO HUMAN BEING CAN BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO COPE WITH RIDICULOUS EXPOSURE TO EXTREME STIMULI, PEOPLE AND OBJECTS, THAT INITIALLY WERE UTILIZED AGAINST THAT PERSON AND SLANDERED ON THAT THE POLICE AND FEDS OPENLY DO NOW. THEREFORE, THERE ARE TRUST ISSUES GALORE, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT MY ATTORNEY.

6) 8.5 YEARS-PLUS OF MOSTLY U.S.A POLICE/FEDERAL ATROCITIES WITH CONTINUED INVASION OF PRIVACY INSIDE RESIDENCES AND PUBLIC WITH "AUTO CUES" AND "SIGN" (SIGN ALS) ARE ABSURD.

7) POLICE-FEDERAL AGENCIES NOW OPENLY DOING WHAT THEY DEFAMED AND SLANDERED ME ABOUT MY OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROAD AND INSIDE LOCATIONS WITH AUDIO/VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND SOUNDS EMITTING OUT OF ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES AND IN-BETWEEN DRYWALL AND STILL DO DESPITE THE LIES ON "LIBERTY".

8) MY CHOICE IS TO GO TO COURT, BOTH SIDES STATE THEIR STORY, BOTH SIDES CROSS-EXAMINED, AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY (PUN INTENDED). LET THE WHOLE TRUTH, NOT REDACTED, PARTIAL TRUTH, COME OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND LET THE AMERICAN JURY DECIDE WITH ALL THE TRUE FACTS.

9) WHAT ARE THE POLICE AND FEDERAL ATTORNEYS SO PARANOID ABOUT IF THEY ARE TELLING AND/OR SUGGESTING THE TRUTH? THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT.

10) APPLEGATE HISTORIES AND LEGACIES OF ALL REMEMBERED 50 YEARS AFTER WE ARE ALL DEAD LIKE NIXON AND WATERGATE, THIS TIME, APPLEGATE.

no ‚Äûconsent for clinical trials" and/or "informed consent" for extreme and excessive abnormal stimuli with "auto cues" and 24/7 inside surveillance since 2001 that the usa corrupt police and feds continually lie about.

does the hippocratic oath apply to psychiatrists as they are lying, except for tia, etc... who did not know (even me at the time) about what the corrupt authorities were and are still doing in attempts to do anything to avoid me to civil litigate:

i need assistance with the usa feds "mediating" and/or negotiating with the corrupt police departments that they now claim are clean and/or safe that i do not believe until given documented proof. additionally, they are doing this without my attorney and before a judge (4th, 6TH & 7TH Bill of Rights violations) and "cherry picking" my life while omissions on their crimes and secrets. i have talked with my attorney, adam bartlett (whose wife is/was a prosecutor) about "national secrets" and "law enforcement secrets" in the police/feds attempts to exclude him and we do not buy it and i will refuse anything without his guidance, period. i am certain that he well knows about confidentiality and i have already shared with him these secrets. apparently, the police "unofficially" admit about being wrong (they are) about some boy and still omitting all their other atrocities, including some federal. apparently, secret meetings are taking place to settle the corrupt mess that is gain!
 ing more and more national and international pressure and media. in december, i will contact the a.c.l.u. and the new yorker magazine's seymour hersch on "applegate" by flying from ft. lauderdale to new york for one day only to personally give my cd full of info.

My father‚Äôs  (Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, J.W.) best friends for decades, Randy Cronce and his J.W. disfellowshipped (meaning in their ‚Äòreligion‚Äù, that he is not to speak with her or me) wife, Sharon Cronce, 907.283.3767, according to Sharon stated that he slandered me by  the comment that ‚Äúthey should be careful with me around boys, their grandchildren,  due to me being a child molester.‚Äù 
Deeply offended, I called my father, James Lindgren, 907.283.1485 @ 10:00 p.m. a.d.t., and he stated that she ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù him and it is due to her being an ‚Äúalcoholic‚Äù even though he drinks a lot himself.  It is odd that it is his own brother, Ron, who is the child molester in our family.
I also called the J.W. elders and left a message due to the civil litigation legal repercussions on defamations since he is a leading figure in their ‚Äúchurch‚Äù.
Other family members, including my mother stated that due to his homophobia that pre-existed her marriage to him and before us kids were born, that is how he thought about gays, and in fact, he stated that to my sisters too before they had children not to be around me because I am gay.

(907) 562-0794
Wandall W. Winn‚Äôs office wrote a 10-page bogus report on me with an mmpi-2 profile written, not spoken, test with several defamations, including not getting my eye color (brown) right by stating that it is blue and that i did so well, i must have been making it up (FYI, I WAS A FORMER FULL-TIME MINISTER FOR YEARS WITH THE J.W. RELIGION). 
WANDALL W. WINN, M.D., AND HIS DAUGHTER, A PH.D PSYCHIATRIST (WE
SPOKE ON EASY ISSUES FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES, SUCH AS THE DAY OF
THE WEEK, ETC√¢‚Ç¨|), VIA MAGELLAN, A S.C.F. PAID SYSTEM, MULTIPLE
TIMES LIED ABOUT ME EVEN THOUGH I ONLY SPOKE WITH THE FATHER
FOR FIVE MINUTES AND BASED ALL THEIR DECISIONS ON AN
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMMPI-2CLINICAL PROFILE√¢‚Ç¨  WITH MANY LIBEL DEFAMATIONS, E.G.,
PAGE 5: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTHIS IS A MARGINALLY VALID MMPI-2 CLINICAL FILE BECAUSE
THE CLIENT MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT AN UNREALISTIC
FAVORABLE PICTURE OF HIS PERSONAL VIRTUE AND MORAL VALUES√¢‚Ç¨ 
IN ADDITION TO MULTIPLE FALSE AND INSULTING DESCRIPTIONS OF ME
(FYI, I WAS A FORMER FULL-TIME MINISTER).

AS AN ADDENDUM, I SPOKE TO 2 OTHER PH.D. PSYCHIATRISTS, ONE IN
FLORIDA AND MY COLLEGE COUNSELOR√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢S BOSS IN COLORADO, ABOUT THE
MMPI-2 AND THEY BOTH STATED THAT ANY PSYCHIATRIST MAY INTERPRET
THE RESULTS ANY WAY THAT THEY WISH, GOOD OR BAD, AND THAT S.C.F.
PAYING THESE PSYCHIATRISTS TAKES AWAY ANY OBJECTIVITY DUE TO
MONETARY REASONS.
THE ONLY ‚ÄûMENTAL HEALTH‚Äú ISSUES ‚ÄûDIAGNOSED‚Äú ARE BY ENTITIES THAT CAN BE SUED AS I WENT ALONG WITH FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS: SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION (WANDALL W.WINN PAID BY MAGELLAN, PAID BY SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION.)

ON 11/19/07, I WENT IN TO DR. RICHARD SERANO @ HIGHLAND NEUROLOGY AT

SERANO, I WAS DENIED MEDICAIDE (EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED AND IS
STILL USING SINCE 2001 "PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES", NAMELY, "SCHIZOPHRENIA", TO CIRCUMVENT MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS).

AGAIN, S.C.F.  (A NON-PROFIT OF COOK INLET REGION, INC) THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS, I WROTE TO THE FEDERAL S.E.C.

8.    Lonnie connection to conspiracy & collusions

‚Ä¢    Date: Mon, Aug 24, 2009 06:16 AM
Subject: Critical info on apd/feds
Bob Nale, a former friend and drug dealer, based out of raven bar, @ worenzoff towers penthouse suite where he lived, 1st suggested a sexual fantasy between me and my brother lonnie. I played along and allowed bob 2 video tape me talking only a fantasy, not reality, as lonnie‚Äôs letters 2 me that i have safe in switzerland prove we never did in his own words and apd/feds attempted entrapment failed in a deal with bob, who has now disappeared, 2 get me 4 their lies and that video that they now have proves it. Plus, the same lies were brought up in florida and los Angeles by law enforcement. Lonnie is now dead. This was a huge witch hunt in addition 2 their other lies, crimes, failed set-ups, entrapments, etc. This is part why they allowed petty stuff in hopes of confessions that never happened. No deal 4 these entrapments as i have even more info.  Bob Ritchie was Bob‚Äôs assistant. I did not know they sold drugs when i met them. 


DARIEN CONNECTION

JUNE 8, 2007

I HAD A CONSERVATION WITH MY SISTER GINA WHO BASICALLY STATED
THAT SOUTHCENTRAL FOUNDATION (S.C.F., MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYER) THAT
ILLEGALLY FIRED ME, DEFAMATION, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìUNFIT FOR DUTY√¢‚Ç¨ , DUE TO WHAT IS
DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT), IN YEARS PAST STATED TO HER
THAT √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTHEY ALREADY KNOW THAT DARIEN (HER SON) WAS MOLESTED BY
ONE OF HIS UNCLES AND THAT GINA STATED THAT SHE REPLIED THAT THIS
WAS NOT TRUE AND THAT THEY REFERRED DARIEN TO ALASKA
PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE (A.P.I. AND THIS CONNECTS PETE (AN EMPLOYEE
AT A.P.I.), FROM PETE AND CHRIS IN ANCHORAGE AND DR. JEFF ELIOT (THE
LOOK-A-LIKE OF MY FATHER) AT A.P.I. WHO CLAIMED TO BE GAY. GINA
BASICALLY STATED THAT THIS INVOLVES ALASKA REPUBLICAN STATE
REPRESENTATIVE BEN STEVENS RETURNING $160,000 IN LOBBYING TO COOK
INLET REGION, INC. (C.I.R.I., OUR NATIVE CORPORATION THAT S.C.F. IS A
NON-PROFIT CORPORATION SUBSIDIARY THAT MY FAMILY ARE

COLLUSIONS AND CONSPIRACIES FROM ALL ENTITIES INVOLVED AND
PEOPLE AS THIS ALSO INVOLVES MY NEPHEW RICHARD AND MY FORMER
STEP-AUNT, MARIANNE SHAVINGS (WHO HAS WORKED THERE FOR
DECADES), AN EMPLOYEE AT ALASKA NATIVE MEDICAL CENTER (A.N.M.C.)

HER BOSS DURING THESE TIME PERIODS.

9.    the aggression from the entities continues while leaving me in a state
of destitution that they are mostly responsible for, although the
public
is not yet aware of all the true facts and when I have a public forum,
or near major newspapers, I will speak about my experiences even if
blocked.   all this information is memorized, so it is irrelevant if
it
is ever inadvertently erased in addition to some surprises once civil
litigation begins and other trials that will open a plethora of other
cases on corruption/possible corruption of the main corrupt law
enforcement personnel in my cases as it will be like mark fuhrman,
l.a.p.d. in
the o.j. simpson case planting evidence and calling blacks

and perjury:
10.    the reasoning to a judge will be the same: SINCE SUCH CORRUPT POLICE
OFFICER/FEDERAL AGENT DID THIS AND THAT CORRUPT INCIDENT WITH MR.
LINDGREN, THIS AND THAT CORRUPT POLICE OFFICER/FEDERAL AGENT WAS THE
MAIN
WITNESS AGAINST MY CLIENT AND THAT LEADS TO SERIOUS DOUBT ON THE
CREDIBILITY OF SUCH CORRUPT LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL WHO WERE THE
PRIMARY
COMPONENTS OF CONVICTION OF MY CLIENT:
6)MOTION TO RE-OPEN AND/OR MOTION TO DISMISS CASES NOT DIRECTLY
ASSOCIATED WITH ME GALORE.
7)MOTION TO DISMISS EVIDENCE/CASES BASED UPON CORRUPTION (TWO EASY FED

KENAI, ALASKA POLICE AND PUBLIC HARASSMENT

ON 18 MAY 2009, KENAI POLICE OFFICER (ALASKA STATE TROOPER) SJORGEN VIOLATED FEDERAL H.I.P.A.A. LAWS BY FOLLOWING ME INTO DENA‚ÄôINA HEALTH CLINIC. I SPOKE WITH CORI AS I WAS IN THE BACK AND SHE STATED NOT TO SPEAK WITH HIM, SO HE LEFT ACCORDING TO THE NURSES.
THEN, I HAVE AUDIO RECORDED KENAI POLICE OFFICER LANGSELF LYING BY STATING THAT I WAS ‚ÄûIN HALCION HAIR SALON‚Äú FOR 20 MINUTES AND THREATENED ME WITH ARREST FOR ‚ÄûTRESPASSING‚Äú (POLICE AGAIN, FT. LAUDERDALE, DUNN, NC, FAYETTEVILLE, NC, AND L.A.P.D. CONNECTIONS).

THEN, OFFICER LANGSELF DENIED 30 SECONDS LATER THAT I WAS AT THAT LOCATION WHEN I KEPT REPEATING WHERE I WAS, AT THE AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL HEALTH CLINIC THAT BOTH OFFICERS ALREADY KNEW. HERSCHBERGER AND LANGSELF LIED.
NOTE: 
1.    WHY DO THE ‚ÄûPUBLIC‚Äú AND POLICE CALL ON ME NOW AFTER 30-60 SECONDS RATHER THAN ASKING ME IN A CIVIL MANNER IF I AM OK IF THEY ‚ÄûTHINK‚Äú THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY CALLING THE POLICE (WHO CALLED? SUBPOENA PUBLIC 9/11 CALLS  (I.E., THE DUNN, NC POLICE OFFICER WIFE CALLING ON ME AND THEIR LIES THAT I LIVED UNDER A BRIDGE AND WAS LOOKING AT THEIR GIRLS. I AM GAY)-(K.P.D. OFFICER LONGSELF STATING THAT I WAS IN A HAIR SALON FOR 20 MINUTES WHEN I WAS IN THE DENA‚ÄôINA HEALTH CLINIC, THAN DENYING STATING THAT 30 SECONDS LATER RECORDED ON MY CELL PHONE) AND POLICE BRIEFINGS/ATTORNEY INSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS) FOR CONNECTIONS GALORE?
2.    WHY DO THE POLICE WAIT, CIRCLING THE AREA TO WAIT 30-60 MINUTES OR MORE FOR ME TO LEAVE A PLACE BEFORE FORCING ME TO SPEAK TO THEM ON ANYTHING TRIVIAL SO THAT THEY MAY HARASS AND SLANDER MY MENTAL HEALTH (ATTORNEY DIRECTED)?
3.    WHY DO A LOT OF THE PUBLIC DISAGREE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED ON ME? IS IT POLITICAL AS THE FT. LAUDERDALE POLICE OFFICERS WHO BEAT ME WHILE HANDCUFFED BEHIND MY BACK STATED THAT I ‚ÄûWILL NOT BE HELPED DUE TO BEING POLITICIZED‚Äú AND ‚ÄûI SHOULD JUST KICK YOUR ASS NOW SO THAT YOU CAN SUE THE DEPARTMENT AND WE CAN SPLIT THE MONEY‚Äú AND L.A.P.D. AND ANCHORAGE POLICE DEPARTMENT LIVINSON AND BLACK LIES ABOUT ‚ÄûMANY CALLS‚Äú LAST YEAR WHEN THE ANCHORAGE POLICE DEPARTMENT DISPATCH SUPERVISOR STATED LATER WHEN I CALLED THAT THERE WAS ONLY 1?
4.    WHY DO THE POLICE IMMEDIATELT THREATEN ME WITH ARREST AND MAKE BOGUS CLAIMS AND LIES THAT I HAVE TO TALK TO THEM? THE 5TH AMENDMENT TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND MY ATTORNEY‚ÄôS INSTRUCTIONS TO TAKE NOTES ARE NOT UNUSUAL, IT IS LEGAL AND ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVLEDGE COMMUNICATION/DOCUMENTATION. I DO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY.

Adam, now, when the precise second i open and close my eyes, touch the toilet paper, touch my genitals, touch my shorts, super loud noises emit from the heater and electrical appliances and between the drywall for the past 8+ years that started in 1989 in west hollywood with corrupt police and feds and sleep deprivation psyche torture. Also after tv comments or mine. Excessively loud and when i complain, the more that the usa fbi, cia, military, or police atrocities increase their actions, especially at night just like juvenilles.

On 8.10.2009, at 7:10 p.m. a.d.t., a white, overweight, large male in green truck: DXB726 with a disability sign (THE USUAL) and parked by a DISTRICT-'attorney' sign;
followed me very slowly from the kenai library as i left to the regal cinema (across the street from merit inn motel), so since i was riding my bike and on the sidewalk, i started to take a photo.
the man was upset as he got opened his truck and yelled:


"HEY, YOU LIKE TAKING MY PICTURE?‚Äù
I STATED THAT IT WAS DUE TO HIS FOLLOWING ME AROUND TOWN.
HE  YELLED: "NO I DID NOT YOU CRAZY FUCK. COME OVER HERE SO THAT I CAN KICK YOUR ASS" 


AS HE WAS WALKING TOWARDS ME.
I CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY STATED THAT THERE 1 OFFICER WAS BUSY AND THAT HE WOULD CALL ME BACK (2 HOURS LATER HE DID, BUT I DID NOT RETURN HIS CALL AS I CALLED DISPATCH AN HOUR LATER AND REPORTED IT TO THE FEMALE POLICE DISPATCH).
KENAI POLICE HARASSMENT ALL SUMMER TOWARDS ME AS THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY HAVE TO ANSWER ALL CALLS. YET, I NEVER THREATENED ANYONE DESPITE ANYTHING AND THE LIES OF THE CALLERS.
SO WHY DID THE POLICE NOT SHOW UP WHEN I CALLLED AS THE TRUCK WAS AT THE REGAL CINEMA AND THE MAN WALKED INSIDE. I TOLD THE POLICE THAT I WOULD WAIT FOR THEM AND THE MALE STATED THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO WASTE WITH ME AND HUNG UP THE PHONE.

45.    in 1989, in los angels, brian cervera introduced me to his drug dealer friend curtis who claimed to be in the film "fame" as a dancer. we spent a few nights in his north hollywood apartment bedroom with no window and he fell asleep due to being up for days on drugs. no one should have known my mannerisms, yet in january 2001, jeff (jeffandjerry.com) mimicked my exact mannerisms, 12 years later, at a gay bath house in los angeles. THAT EXPLAINS WHY JEFF, RICHARD FROM AUSTRALIA, MARK GONZAGA (WEST HOLLYWOOD SHERIFF, ET AL) KNEW ME FROM BACK THEN AND I DID NOT KNOW THEM AS THERE HAD TO BE SURVEILLANCE IN CURTIS' APARTMENT. THUS, THERE SHOULD BE ENORMOUS PROOF OF THAT AND THE SNAPPY CAR RENTAL INCIDENT BEFORE 1989 AND IN 1987, ANCHORAGE POLICE OFFICER STEWART DUE TO MY FRIENDSHIP, NOT SEXUAL, WITH HIS NEPHEW DEREK STEWART WHO LATER WORKED FOR U.P.S. AT THE ANCHORAGE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. PREVIOUS TO THAT, THERE WERE ISSUES (LIES) WITH THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES AND THEIR EL!

RICHARD CASTANEDA, AND POSSEE ARE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
ALL KNOW ONE ANOTHER, (MUCH, MUCH MORE) AND SOMETIMES IN
THE PUBLIC...THIS "THING" ALSO MULTIPLE TIMES SPIT IN MY FACE AND
STATED THAT HE WANTED TO HUMILATE ME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND
TO DESTROY MY LIFE, DRANK SOME OF MY URINE AS I WAS GOING TO
THE BATH ROOM BEFORE I MADE HIM STOP DUE TO BEING DISGUSTING
TO ME.

In 2001, in January, in Los Angeles, I was intentionally infected with
H.I.V. by a
clandestine Drug Enforcement Agent and suspect that this was caught on
tape as I applied
to the F.B.I. in the fall of 2000. The reason that this is likely true
is that his boyfriend stated
to me comments on these issues in the summer of 2001 when I returned to
Los Angeles to
attend Law School, yet was unable to due to the hysterical shock that I
experienced after
unexpectedly hearing my H.I.V. status and I had an eyewitness, Matthew
Calcarra as well
51.     Dr. Michael Sampson, and the associated documents.

52.    A D.E.A. AGENT INTENTIONALLY INFECTING ME WITH H.I.V. AND KEPT

Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N.C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The courtís decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.

The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the courtís ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The courtís decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.

ìIím appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,î said Gov. Perdue. ìI donít believe the General Assemblyís intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.î

The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission

Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our stateís second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ñ especially during this economic downturn.†

As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.

The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.

Premier to Add 300 Jobs in Charlotte

Premier Inc., the largest healthcare alliance in the nation, will move its headquarters from California and expand in Charlotte, adding 300 jobs over the next five years and investing $17.7 million. The project was made possible in part by a state Job Development Investment Grant.

Israeli Fiber Company Brings $17 Million Investment, 42 Jobs to Granville County

Shalag Industries Ltd., an international supplier of nonwoven fabrics used in the hygiene and wipes markets, will open a new plant in Granville County.† The company will invest more than $17 million and create 42 jobs in Oxford.† The announcement was made possible in part by a $110,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

ìNorth Carolina is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the United States, and the U.S. is home to more nonwoven textile plants than anywhere else in the world,î Perdue said.† ìOur business-friendly policies, superb quality of life and skilled, productive workforce are helping companies build success in our state.î

Shalag Industries, headquartered in Upper Galilee, Israel, produces nonwoven fabrics primarily from polypropylene, polyester and viscose fibers.† The fabric is used in the production of dry and wet wipes, diapers and personal hygiene products.† The companyís major customers include Johnson & Johnson, Nicepak and Kimberly Clark.

The company, which has one manufacturing plant in Israel, plans to construct a facility in Oxford, where fibers will be thermo-bonded into nonwoven fabric.† The projectís 42 new jobs will pay an average annual wage of $39,966, not including benefits, which is higher than the Granville County average annual wage of $33,020.

H1N1 Vaccine Arriving in Waves; Vaccine Locator on the Way

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/Blog/post/2009/10/16/H1N1-Vaccine-arriving-in-Waves-Vaccine-Locator-on-the-Way.aspx>A blog post by Dr. Megan Davies, State Epidemiologist:

To date North Carolina has received two shipments of H1N1 vaccine.† While the total of these allocations is roughly equal to about 10 percent of the total doses we expect to receive, the CDC assures us that there will be enough vaccine for every North Carolinian who wants it.

The goal in determining allocations during the past two weeks was to make sure the vaccine was distributed equitably throughout the state.† With such small amounts of vaccine ñ and a requirement to ship in increments of 100 doses ñ it was impossible to provide vaccine to every interested provider.† The first shipment went to every local health department to ensure that vaccine was distributed to every part of the state.† With the next shipment, we were able to extend delivery to also include most hospitals and private providers who had signed on to administer the vaccine.

By the end of this week, we expect to have received enough vaccine so that all providers who have submitted a contract will be shipped at least some vaccine.† Providers who requested a large amount of vaccine will not receive their complete order all at once, but will receive parts of their order during the next couple of months until the amount they requested is completely filled. Vaccine will continue to be sent to providers as long as the provider data continues to show a need for vaccine.†

To help North Carolina residents determine when and where vaccine is available, the NC Division of Public Health is working with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to create a ìvaccine locator.î† When completed, residents will be able to locate vaccine in their area simply by going to <http://flu.nc.gov/>flu.nc.gov and typing in a zip code.† Until then, people should either call their health care provider, their local health department, or call the NC CARE-LINE at 1-800-662-7030 (TTY 1-877-452-2514) for more information.

$14.6 Million in Federal Funds Approved for State Veterans Home in Black Mountain

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (USDVA) has conditionally approved the stateís application for federal assistance to build a 100-bed State Veterans Home in Black Mountain.† Conditions for the $14.6 million award include finalizing design documents, approval by involved state agencies, and advertising and award of construction bids.

ìThis facility will go a long way toward providing the long-term, skilled care that our veterans deserve,î said Gov. Bev Perdue.† ìThe collaboration between the Department of Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to identify an appropriate site already owned by the state is a great example of government working for the people.î

The amount of $14,632,787 has been set aside by the USDVA for the Western North Carolina project, according to a letter of award from USDVA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki. Last month, the USDVA announced that $12,119,575 in federal matching funds have been set aside for a similar facility in Kinston. Both projects are funded by appropriations through the N.C. General Assembly and funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

There are two State Veterans Homes presently in North Carolina, one in Fayetteville and the other in Salisbury.† Each of the new facilities will provide residential care for up to 100 veterans and will employ 150-170 staff.

I don't believe the Govenor should leave this country, this state...until every single possible effort is made to stop the release of those prisoners.† What in the world???† Why have trials, why make the victims continue to be hurt..this has to stop.† Who passed such a thing...who decides this crazyness.

Who is paying for this trip???† I keep asking.†† Who dreamed up this so called job boom by making this trip???† Who did the research???† What is that based on??

We should be informed clearly.

> Gov. Perdue Appalled at Ruling that Cuts Short Life Sentences

Gov. Bev Perdue this week asked her attorneys and the N..C. Department of Justice to review all options available to the state to reverse and delay the N.C. Supreme Court ruling in the State v. Bowden case. The court‚Äôs decision in that case will force the early release of murderers and rapists serving life sentences, including seven who were originally sentenced to death.
The governor this week received a list of 20 violent offenders who will be released on Oct. 29 and dozens more who will be released in the next few years because of the court‚Äôs ruling. Each of the first 20 inmates who will be released have been reviewed for parole multiple times and denied. The court‚Äôs decision also prevents any additional review or recommendation by the Parole Commission, nor can these offenders be subject to any kind of monitoring or post-release supervision.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm appalled that the state of North Carolina is being forced to release prisoners who have committed the most heinous of crimes, without any review of their cases,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe the General Assembly‚Äôs intent in 1974 was to let these violent offenders out of prison early. Releasing these potentially dangerous criminals is not in the best interest of the state or our citizens.‚Äù
The Department of Correction is attempting to notify all known victims of these crimes and is working with district attorneys and victims advocates to locate victims for whom it does not have current contact information.† Victims who have not been contacted are asked to call the DOC Office of Victim Services toll free at 1-866-719-0108. In addition, DOC is working to identify recommended re-entry programs for offenders due to be released, although participation cannot be required.

Gov. Perdue Continues to Push Hard for Jobs, Economic Development

Governor†Departs for Asian Economic Development Mission
Gov. Perdue on Thursday left for her Economic Development Trip to Asia with one mission: to grow jobs in North Carolina.† As our state‚Äôs second and fourth largest trading partners, China and Japan represent significant growth opportunities for North Carolina ‚Äì especially during this economic downturn.†
As part of the trade mission, Gov. Perdue will meet with Asian manufacturing, technology and life science companies that have the potential to do business and create jobs in North Carolina.
The Economic Development Mission is scheduled for Oct. 15-27.† <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/Calendar.aspx>Click here for the mission itinerary.

WOW, can't be too bad considering the same was done to our Youth in residential III and IV group homes. We the people were appalled at the cuts for these services. Hate to be cruel, maybe they will join forces being as how these prisoners and the children were voted. Back into the street. Many were appalled at her decision as well. !!!!!
