Subject: Illegal Immigration

Comment: What proposals has the governor put in place to stem this ever increasing flow of illegal immigrants into our state. How do we stop having to spend all the money for special services, housing assistance, emergency medical support, etc.etc. Where is the action on this serious issue that is draining our state coffers? The amount of available jobs is decreasing in our state but the flow of illegals by all accounts is still increasing...what gives??

Comment: Michael Norbury PO Box 38892 Greensboro, NC 27438-8892 September 11, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: 11% unemployment and you want to spend MORE NC Tax money on non-residents? May I remind the tax burden per illegal immigrant household runs about $140 per year. Opening our schools is going to invite more illegal households on NC soil which is going to wildly increase the amount of the tax burden. Illegal immigrants statistically send back %15-20 of their paychecks south of the border and that's money that needs to stay here for actual citizens! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ILLEGAL ACTION!

Subject: Education Budget

Comment: I am all for excellent education, but that does not mean that there is not waste in the school systems in N.C. I witnessed wasteful spending for equipment (computers) that was not used at the local community college. I also saw some very bad 'teachers' as well. Also, a newspaper article said that $10,000 was spent for each child in a school year. With this figure, 100 kids = 1,000,000 dollars.How many illegal aliens are in N.C. schools now? Education should not be treated as a sacred cow that cannot be touched, improvements need to be made. Thanks for your time. David Paschal

ITEMS TO CONSIDER FOR NC AND THE US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ACTIONS.† EVERY POLITICIAN SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO CHARLES STALEY PREACHING TODAY FOR TODAY-9/13/09.
THE US HAS NEVER DETERMINED HOW 80 BILLION DOLLARS ON US WEAPONS DISAPPEARED AND USED AGAINST THE US.†TAX DOLLARS TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE'S CHECK(HARD EARNED MONEY DAILY) UNACCOUNTABLE, WASTED MONEY.† MORE TO BE TAKEN, UNREAL.† WHAT HAPPEN TO ALL THE MONEY SPENT ON ENERGY EFFICIENT PROGRAMS, POWER BILLS STILL HIGH.
NC LISTEN supports the following immigration policy recommendations:
1. Enforce Immigration Law
Existing laws requiring apprehension and deportation of all illegal aliens in the U.S.A must be enforced. Today our interior enforcement is dangerously weak. Increase the manpower and technology of our US Border Patrol and build a two-layer fence on strategic sections of our southern border. Expedite the completion of an entry-exit database by mandating the inclusion of data on all foreign visitors. Require all employers to use the federal government's E-Verify System to verify worker eligibility. Fine employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. Do NOT allow illegal immigrants to acquire a state driver's license or driving privilege.
2. No More Amnesties
We oppose additional amnesties granting legal status or citizenship to illegal aliens. Amnesties reward illegal behavior and unnecessarily encourage more illegal entry into the U.S.A. Restrict government benefits, other than emergency care, to illegal immigrants.

3. Return to Sensible Legal Immigration
Reduce legal immigration to 250,000 per year to allow the U.S.A. to get control of its borders and adequately deal with Homeland Security concerns.

4. No More "Guest Worker" Programs
There are very few, if any, "jobs Americans won't do". There are far more jobs Americans use to do that are now being done by illegal immigrants at low wages and, frequently, off-the-books. Allow our free market system to determine the wages at which Americans will do jobs. Allowing mass immigration simply distorts worker supply and demand and artificially drives down wages. This is no longer just a low-skilled worker phenomenon

Gov. Perdue Designates September As Library Card Sign-Up Month

Gov. Bev Perdue on Tuesday†designated September as <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ProclamationDetail.aspx?newsItemID=598>Library Card Sign-up Month in North Carolina, encouraging children, families and North Carolina residents to explore their public library and its many resources and to sign up for the ‚Äúsmartest card.‚Äù
‚ÄúA public library card gives you access to a whole world of information and imagination,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúDuring these tough economic times, our state‚Äôs public libraries are critical because they help residents learn to read, use computers and develop other skills they need to succeed.‚Äù
During September the State Library of North Carolina, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, <http://www.ncculture.com/>www.ncculture.com and libraries from Murphy to Manteo, both rural and urban, join to spread the message that the library card is the ‚Äúsmartest card‚Äù to have in your wallet.† The goal is to make the library card the most valued and used card for North Carolina residents. Nearly five million North Carolinians are card-carrying library users.
During the last fiscal year†there were more than†37 million†visits to North Carolina public libraries and more than 9 million of them used library computers.
Growth in materials being checked out, customer visits and especially internet use at libraries continues a trend. Nationally, public library visits are up 19% from 2000 to 2006.† Circulation of library materials is up 20%.† Access to public computers is up 86%.
The "Smartest Card" initiative is part of The Campaign for America's Libraries, a multi-year public awareness and advocacy effort by the American Library Association.† Begun in 2004, the campaign promotes the value of public libraries nationwide.

AMNESTY AND JOBLESSNESS:
Unemployed Americans Shouldn't Have to Compete for Jobs with Illegal Aliens
Introduction
With an official unemployment rate of 9.5 percent, American workers now face the worst job market in 25 years. In fact, over the past 60 years, the unemployment rate has rarely been as high as it is today. Despite a difficult job market, President Obama and leaders in Congress are talking about passing so-called ‚Äúcomprehensive immigration reform‚Äù legislation. This legislation would give amnesty to 12 million or more illegal aliens, including an estimated 8.3 million illegal aliens who hold jobs they never should have had, and could include a proposed new guest-worker provision to import hundreds of thousands of additional foreign workers. If enacted, illegal aliens would be allowed to keep these jobs instead of making them available to American citizens and legal immigrants who are out of work. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the law that requires available jobs to be filled by legal workers is respected. Consideration of amnesty, particularly in these harsh economic times, constitutes a failure by Congress to live up to its basic responsibilities to the American people.

Subject: Community College Education

Comment: As a single woman who made the decision to have no children, I seem to not qualify for any sort of tuition assistance, even though I made slightly less than 10,000 dollars last year. I am completely incapable of affording any sort of community college classes without assistance. The primary reason I cast my vote for Ms. Perdue was a campaign promise I saw via a television commercial that community colleges would have free tuition in North Carolina. I would like to know if this is something that has even come up as a possibility. As it stands, access to higher education generally means a more educated populace with higher paying jobs. Clearly this means more tax revenue in the long run, and this is an issue that is very close to my heart.

Subject: an ordinary citizen

Comment: Melissa Savino 3101 Walnut Hollow Rd Brevard, NC 28712-8675 September 14, 2009 The Honorable Beverly Perdue Governor of North Carolina 20301 Mail Service Center Raleigh, NC 27699-0301 Governor Perdue: I am far from what anyone could even remotely describe as an activist. Up until two years ago, I was a silent and apathetic voter. Disliking confrontation, I rarely expressed my political opinions outside of my own living room. I had grown disheartened and jaded about the American political process. Like many others, I assumed the defeatist attitude that the democratic system was a corrupt failure - that nothing in our government would ever change and there was nothing I could do about it. I believed there was no way my voice would ever be heard. But the truth is, the last election changed me - for the better, I believe. Regardless of partisan affiliations, that election galvanized thousands of disenfranchised voters like me. It made me believe that maybe - just maybe - my voice did matter. That maybe- along with the efforts of my fellow citizens - I could make a difference. More than that, it restored in me a sense of civic responsibility. I realized that being a citizen of this nation and this great State is far more than just a privilege. Being an American citizen includes an obligation to participate in the process: a civic mandate to pay attention and to hold my representatives accountable for their actions. I could hardly blame the State for their indifference, if I neglected to voice my concerns and expectations. And for the first time in a very long while, I became engaged once again. I began reading and following the political news, and recognized that the actions implemented by my national and state leaders directly affects me - my family -my neighbors - my community - my state - and my country. I am a very ordinary citizen. I'm not an expert or pundit: I hold no degree in political science. I'm a middle class woman in her fifties with a standard college education and no special qualifications. I have worked hard all my life: always holding down at least two jobs to make ends meet and to provide for my family. I have spent part of my career in the public sector as a government or non-profit administrator, while also supplementing my income as a pet groomer. Like most average Americans, my husband and I have experienced periods of moderate financial comfort, and periods of near poverty. I've seen both side of the fence and I have learned much from my experiences. My PhD in political awareness comes not from an elite university, but from life itself. And maybeÔøΩ.just maybeÔøΩyou may discover that even someone as ordinary as I might have some constructive ideas that could help find solutions. This is why I encourage you to show a willingness to hear and consider my opinions and suggestions, and those of all your other constituents. We may not always agree: we may sometimes hold different opinions on the role of government and the way to achieve certain goals. I know that as a professional politician, the media often provokes you to place more importance on the 'process' than the actual results. But please don't let them, and the political culture, force you to forget your primary responsibility. Never forget why you ran for office: what you hoped to accomplish when you started out, before political expediency becomes a habit. Just as we citizens have a civic responsibility - you too have this duty. Please continue to remember why you were elected - to serve your country and fellow citizens - not to serve the special interests who would like to control you.

Subject: Illegal immegrants attending NC community colleges

Comment: Please find a copy of my letter to the executive director of the State of NC Community College Board regarding this issue. Thank you. September 16, 2009 sullinsr@nccommunitycolleges.edu. Dear Mr. Sullins: I understand that the North Carolina Community College Board has announced they will recommend allowing illegal immigrants to attend our state Community Colleges at your meeting tomorrow. Our state unemployment rate is 11%. State-supported Community Colleges are in place to better educate and train citizens and LEGAL immigrants so they can get jobs, but instead the NC Community College Board wants to help educate illegal immigrants for jobs here in North Carolina? By doing so you would be using taxpayer dollars to aid and abet criminals here against our laws who should be deported to take their place in line with those who show respect for this country and our legal system and obtain citizenship using the proper channels. You would also be complicit in perpetuating our already unmanageable illegal immigration problem. Last year Governor Beverly Perdue said she was opposed to this plan and the matter was placed on hold. Now I ask that this issue be placed on hold permanently. I am registering my strong objection to this proposal and I question the legality of such action. All NC Community Colleges should be required to use the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements System (SAVE) to make sure all applicants are legally present in the U.S. in the same way that employers are now required to E-Verify prospective job applicants. It is a violation of federal law to hire an illegal aliens; it makes no sense to educate them ‚Äì especially with our tax-payer dollars and federal funds received through grants to the college. I also suggest that you verify how many illegal immigrants are currently in the Community College system and suspend them pending satisfactory completion of the requirements for citizenship in this country. I ask you to focus on you mission of providing educational opportunities to those here legally. I would encourage an outreach effort to include more LEGAL immigrants. Illegal aliens can obtain higher education in their native country and should do so. We have presumably already educated them through high school, which I believe is generous and enough. Sincerely, JoAnn Gottsleben Trent Woods, NC joann@myworkingspace.com Cc: Office of Governor Beverly Perdue

Comment: I understand that tomorrow the APPOINTED Community College Executive Board will vote to give illegal aliens access to NC colleges.I am appalled that the Board would vote this way.

This action should not be allowed without a vote of the citizens of NC since this is against the wishes of a vast majority of NC citizens!

Subject: Undocumented Immigrants and Community College Admissions

Comment: In the Sept 17th edition of the Greensboro News-Record, I read with interest a story regarding a proposal being considered by the State Community College Board that would enable undocumented immigrants to attend NC community colleges at the out-of-state tuition rate. I realize that any action by the Board to adopt such a policy would still move into consideration by the General Assembly and its statutory authority. I also read with interest Gov. Perdue's comments regarding such a proposal. My question is as follows: Has no one addressed the fact that, currently, high school-aged undocumented students are potentially eligible to attend an early college high school on a community college campus? As I understand, undocument immigrant high school-aged students are eligible to attend public high school. Presumably, they would be eligible to be considered for attendance at an early college high school. If chosen for a seat in an early college high school, the student would be taking community college courses as a part of the high school program. The aim of the early college high school program is to enable students to complete programs that result in the award of both a high school diploma and an associate degree. Thus, in such a scenario, isn't it possible for undocumented immigrant students to attend the community college through this provision? I've not heard anyone address this issue as a potential 'loophole' that would clearly enable undocumented students to attend a community college. I would appreciate having someone review this matter to determine how best to make the information known to the public. Thank you.

Dear Gov. Perdue,

I'm outraged that the State Board of Community Colleges is allowing illegal immigrants to take classes at taxpayer-supported community colleges. Regardless of whether they are paying in-state or out-of-state tuition, the Board is condoning illegal immigration. 

I strongly encourage the General Assembly to take swift action to repeal this measure if it gets approval by the full board.

Sincerely,

Comment: I think it is a shame when Grown Men and Women blatently break Laws. You have done a great job in the appointment of Law Breakers by allowing them to let Illegals into the Community College System. It is shamefull when the Colleges are at capacity and LEGAL NC Citizens are being laid off in record numbers and can not get in and the CC Board is going to break the law and allow illegals in. It is time they are charged for breaking the LAW. When will you all ever learn to quit the POLITICAL Correctness and get back in the business of the taxpayers of this state.

Subject: Illegal Imigrants signing up for School

Comment: I couldn't believe what I read in the news, that illegal imigrants are going to be able to sign up, this just doesn't make any sense. What part of illegal is no body getting. Maybe you could get all of the illegals to sign up and catch them and send people back. I am so sick of paying out of my pocket for taxes, medical, and the government just takes, and takes and takes. Somebody needs to wake up and fight for the ones that are here honestly, pays taxes all there life and then our elderly are left high and dry. I am dealing with elderly parents, and it takes there life's earnings just to make ends meet and pay hospital bills, and medications. But no, let someone be here illegally and let's give them social security, free hospital care, and now let them sign up for school. You have not proven yourself one bit, and the sad part is, that I voted for you, but I can promise, never again. I do not support you in a lot of decisions that you have made. So far lets just keep going up on taxes, and I guess we will be out on the street soon. Illegals run this country, cause we would be discrimating if we didn't. How can you honestly think this is right and live with that in your heart know that it is not. Take care of the ones that are here, and have paid there debt, taxes, all there life.

Comment: I'm having trouble understanding the logic in allowing illegal aliens to attend community colleges. Does this mean that the state deems them legal because they're attending college (paying tuition)? No to illegals in any public place, put ICE agents on campus's statewide during registration week... send them home and spend the money on our k-12 education problems.ILLEGALS have NO business being anywhere except in jail or deportation."If our government, any business, school system, Law Enforcement or any body knowingly allows illegal immigrants to do any thing in this country is breaking the LAW. If the community college system allows illegal immigrants to enroll, they are encouraging illegal activity. ...They are traitors to this state and country in the truest sense. Our government, both parties, continue to fail the American people."

Subject: Illegal Immigrants-Community Colleges

Comment: Today's decision to allow ILLEGAL immigrants to attend North Carolina community colleges or any state-supported school is OUTRAGEOUS! What part of ILLEGAL is difficult for them to understand? It is equivalent to allowing criminals to benefit from tax dollars. My tax dollars help fund these schools and I DO NOT SUPPORT this kind of wasteful spending. In times where budgets are tight &/or lacking, why would crucial tax dollars be spent on ILLEGAL ALIENS? This kind of abuse and misappropriation of tax dollars should be over-turned by the Governor. These are the kinds of things that will be remembered at the polls.

Comment: They should not be allowed in, but apparently school administrators decided to allow them to attend. School administrators are not legislators and should abide by laws. They should be fired. D.Paschal

Subject: ILLEGAL Immigrants @ NC Schools

Comment: I know your position originally was that you supported ILLEGAL immigrants at our schools until during your campaign (that you only won b/c of the idiots who did a straight Democratic party ticket for Obama) you changed your mind and are supposedly now against it. Couple questions for big brother if I may: Why were you for it in the first place? No matter to whether or not it's beneficial to society, they are ILLEGAL. and it's really fucked up that our country has this discussion at all. Not just schools but why are they still here? How hard is it to arrest someone and put them back on a plane to their own country...there kids too. It's bad enough that Federal Government nowadays has way too much power over the States and the people..but when NC has an unelected board make decisions about ANYTHING that we pay taxes for something is not right... People are just going to keep getting more and more fed up with you and other governors like you that defy the constitution and let the Federal Government decide what's best for everybody....Who better to make decisions that effect our State's affairs than the State itself! Stand up for NC and stand up for the constitution! If you need help call Ron Paul. I'm sure as Governor of NC you could get in touch with him! He is well educated well spoken and not afraid to stand up to an overreaching Federal Government. and don't forget...there should never be a discussion about ILLEGAL immigration...there is no grey area...your either ILLEGAL or LEGAL....and while the debate of legalization of immigrants is great to have....while it's being discussed there should be no question at all! SEND THEM HOME!

Subject: Vote on illlegals into community college

Comment: Do you know what the term "illegal immigrant" means? An illegal immigrant should not have access to WIC, public housing, a job, etc. If they want to take steps to become legal then they can attend college. I can't even believe the audacity of the General Assembly. This bill DOES NOT NEED TO BE PASSED.

Comment: Dear Governor Purdue, This email is to urge you to stop the illegal immigrants from attending our Community Colleges. My husband's ancestors and my ancestors have lived in North Carolina before the Revolutionary War. Our families have paid taxes all of these years for the school system only to have the illegals steal what we have paid for. Please stand up against this effort as you promised during your campaign.

Comment: How can our Community Colleges harbor Illegal Immigrants without ICE getting involved? Also how can they get jobs after going to colleges without being a citizen, as that is against the law to hire an illegal. You might like to check out the pole taken on Channel 14 web site. I do not understand the Committee going against the laws of this wonderful USA! Peggy http://news14.com/content/poll_results/?RegionCookie=30&PollID=1013

Subject: Illegals in our state colleges!

Comment: Shame on you! Allowing the appointees to the State Board of Colleges to recommend that illegals get out of state tuition rates and be allowed to enter our schools. This is breaking our laws on all levels. First, illegals are felons who have not been served justice. Second, NC prosecutes employers who hire illegals, is this the same thing? We are going to send you mail, like you have never seen before. Here's the deal. You will get rocks from all of us rock solid legal US citizens who find this a slap in the face our our constitutions, US and State. Get rid of every board member and appoint people who respect our laws!!!!

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, After reading your comment on WRAL, I find it unacceptable that you have not taken measures to prevent this travesty upon your constituency. I am a graduate of the North Carolina University system and I also attended community college here. As a resident and a tax paying legal citizen, I vehemently oppose this and request you take all appropriate measures to prevent this from happening. Regards, Eric Hart

Subject: Illegals in College?

Comment: You have got to be kidding me, right? Am I to understand that NC will allow ILLEGALS to attend our community colleges? First they come here and STEAL our jobs, then they show up at the emergency rooms and STEAL our health care dollars and now they go to school and STEAL an education. I trust you will use your influence to end this stupidity!

Subject: NO Community College for Illegal Immigrants

Comment: Honorable Gov. Purdue: Thank you for supporting a continued ban on accepting illegal immigrants in NC Community Colleges. We hope that the Board of Community College will agree with you and you will do all you can to continue to oppose any changes to our current policy. We agree that if students are here illegally, they cannot work here legally. It doesn't make sense to provide the opportunity for training for them, especially in this economic climate which has so adversely affected our economy. Even if it is a SMALL NUMBER of students we are talking about, it is a bad philosophical move. Our colleges are already strapped with Americans who are trying to get new skills to face the challenges in this economy. Please support your NC Constituents by continuing to oppose allowing illegal immigrants in our community colleges. Sincerely, Linda & Larry Thompson

Subject: Accept Undocument People in NC Community Colleges

Comment: I'm delighted that the NC Board of Community Colleges is recommending admissions for undocumented people in our state. Discrimination against people based on their legal status makes no sense. NC gains terrific economic benefit from undocumented workers even as we use the law to harrass them. If people are seeking to better themselves through education, the state should support that - whether people already here are better educated, or they take their paid-for education back to their countries of origin, "a rising tide lifts all boats". Please support the Board.

Subject: Illegals in colleges and the workplace

Comment: Governor Perdue, NC Since states are only required to educate illegals through high school, can't you implement an executive order requiring proof of citizenship for all higher education since not doing so results in aiding and abetting? Another executive order could assist your state's budget and unemployed by mandating "business license" holders to enroll in and use E-Verify and the IMAGE Program for all jobs. As a "business license" mandate you are not breaking federal law. E-Verify use has been upheld up in Arizona and other state's courts. Mary Steele 866-887-6629

Subject: Community Colleges and Immigrants

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I met you several years ago at a gathering of Democrats in Carolina Trace, long before you ran for governor. I am a retired Presbyterian minister, and my wife is a retired public school teacher. I am disappointed in the stand you have taken about the proposed admission of undocumented workers to our community college. Your reasoning that these students would not be able to work in our state is another issue that should be resolved for the benefit of all concerned. I believe you have been poorly advised, because your position is very much in line with Republican leaders in our state. I hope you will also seek the advice of spiritual counselors, because this is definitely a peace and justice issue, and if you are a person of faith you will be concerned about the moral implications of this decision. First of all, federal officials have already advised that no law stands in the way of admission of the students in question. 2. Many of these students were born in this country, or came to our country with their parents when they were young children. 3. These immigrants came to American to escape extreme poverty and to provide a better future for their families. Most immigrants came to American for this same reason. 4. The Federal government should have seen this problem coming and provided some kind of program for issung work permits that could later open the way to citizenship. 5. Most of these immigrants are making a contribution of our economy. Bob Heuts, the economic development officer for Lee County, confirmed this. I know that most of them are active in churches, and that many are Presbyterian, as well as Catholic, and other denominations. 6. Keeping immigrants poor and ignorant, whether they are legal or not, is not the solution. This will only make them dependent and prone to anti-social behavior. 7. Immigrants should not be regarded as out of state students if they live and work in the state. Putting economic barriers in the way of their education not only harms the students but creates other problems for the state as well. Jesus condemned the lawyers for placing heavy burdens on the poor, and not lifting a finger to help them. 8. Hispanics are becoming a major element of our population across the country. Many of them are voting in elections and serving in office, and they will look with disfavor on candidates who have been repressive and punitive in their views. I urge you to reexamine your views and to take a more enlightened and compassionate stand on this important issue. Respectfully yours, Thomas K. Spence, Jr.

Subject: Admission of illegal aliens to our state Community Colleges

Comment: I am strongly opposed to admitting illegal aliens to our state Community Colleges and am in support of requiring ALL state Community Colleges to use the federal S.A.V.E. System to make sure ALL applicants are legally present in the US. It is violation of federal law for companies to hire illegal aliens and I strongly believe it should be illegal for state Community Colleges to admit illegal aliens. In my opinion, by admitting illegals to state Community Colleges is putting your stamp of approval on their illegal activity as well as aiding and abetting them in their illegal activity.

Comment: I think that it's a travesty that illegal aliens are being allowed to attend our Community College system. Why? They don't pay State taxes that support the system. I don't want my taxes support illegal aliens!! If the State of North Carolina is in such dire straits with the budget then I really don't see how this plan can be offered. It will cost the State more money to pay for these illegal aliens to attend. What is it going to come down to now? Special classrooms for Spanish only speaking students? More money for more instructors and more classroom space. I look forward to one day leaving this State and taking my tax dollars with me if this pandering continues.

Comment: I noticed this piece of news on a web site today. I hope that you will do what is right for our country and in this case specifically YOUR state and Block the proposal to educate illegal immigrants. This would encourage them to return home and apply for citizenship in the correct manner. As illegals they should not benefit from our country at their choice while chosing to not support our country with taxes and its Laws of Citizenship. Thank You for your consideration. You Must Give your attention to this matter as it would be another inroad against our Laws and Security. Richard M. Butler M.D.
