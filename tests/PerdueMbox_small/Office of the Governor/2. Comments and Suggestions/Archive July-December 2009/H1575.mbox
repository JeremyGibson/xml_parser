Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm asking you to vote against H1575, a 'risk remediation' bill
that would lower the standards for cleanups of soil and
groundwater pollution.

I know people who get their water from drinking water wells,
from groundwater. Regular testing doesn't cover all the toxic
chemicals that can contaminate groundwater. We depend on North
Carolina's strong current laws that require full cleanups of
contamination to keep our drinking water clean. H1575 would
remove that requirement, putting the health of current and
future well users in jeopardy.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

North Carolina has some of the strongest groundwater standards
in the nation. Currently state law requires polluters to clean
up their messes, if possible, until there is no pollutant left
in groundwater above background levels. 

H1575, if passed, will weaken our state law by allowing a
polluter to propose a weaker 'site specific standard' rather
than cleaning up their entire mess. But as North Carolina?s
population grows, clean soil and groundwater are increasingly
precious resources and we can?t afford to contaminate them.

More importantly, because H1575 greatly reduces the cost (to
polluters) of cleaning up spills, it encourages companies to be
less responsible in their future management of risky chemicals.
The result: if H1575 passes, we can expect to see more new
spills and pollution than we would under current laws.

Please protect public health and reject H1575.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mary Bowman

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Remediation of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal
with, corporations would spend less to avoid them, leading to
more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

Raleigh, NC 27699-0001

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm asking you to vote against H1575, a 'risk remediation' bill
that would lower the standards for cleanups of soil and
groundwater pollution.

I receive my water from a shallow aquifer that will soon be
comprimised by the Titan Cement Plant proposed for Wilmington,
NC. I know many people who get their water from drinking water
wells, from groundwater. Regular testing doesn't cover all the
toxic chemicals that can contaminate groundwater. We depend on
North Carolina's strong current laws that require full cleanups
of contamination to keep our drinking water clean. H1575 would
remove that requirement, putting the health of current and
future well users in jeopardy.


Sincerely,

This is a public health issue that needs attention. Clean

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.

This is embarrassing that such a law would even be proposed and
I expect you to oppose it unless you want to be associated with
destroying our quality of life.

Remediation of contaminated sites is expensive. Because it is
expensive, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal

more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

You may already oppose this bill. If so, thank you. I believe
that our State has some good groundwater protection that could
be in danger if this bill passes. Current state law requires
companies that spill toxic chemicals into soil and groundwater
to clean them up to background levels. It is not too much to ask
that they do this, but H1575 would allow companies to walk away
without fully cleaning up their pollution if they put
restrictions on future land use. But in practice, those
restrictions aren't going to be enforced or even remembered
years from now, leading to future public health problems. I
believe that this bill should be rejected as not in the public
interest.

Thank you for your consideration.

carefully. H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away
without fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost
to future generations. With spills costing much less to deal
with, corporations would spend less to avoid them, leading to
more frequent spills and accidents. Please oppose H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please oppose H1575, a special-interest bill that weakens
cleanup standards for polluted soil and groundwater.

Dear legislator, 

Please continue to support our great NC anti pollution laws. As
you know, fixing contaminated sites is expensive. Because of
this, most companies take care to manage toxic chemicals
carefully. 

H1575 would let companies that cause spills walk away without
fully cleaning up their mistakes, transferring the cost to
future generations. THIS IS WRONG. With spills costing much less
to deal with, corporations would spend less to avoid them,
leading to more frequent spills and accidents. 

Please oppose H1575, with all your heart, and convince whoever
else needs convincing, that this bill serves no one.

Sincerely,

Roberta Greenspan

Dear Governor Perdue,

Please reject H1575, 'Accelerate Remediation', which weakens
standards for the cleanup of groundwater pollution.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters
shirk responsibility for spills. As North Carolina grows, we're
going to need all our groundwater resources. We can't afford to
write them off today as a subsidy to businesses that have been
careless. That's not fair to future generations, and it's not
fair to existing businesses that have taken appropriate care.
Please defeat H1575.

This bill doesn't accelerate remediation; it lets polluters

going to need all our groundwater resources.This is especially a
concern for those of us in Pender county, who want to be sure
Titan Cement properly cleans up the pollution at their proposed
site. We can't afford to write off our aquifers as a subsidy to
businesses that have been careless. That's not fair to future
generations, and it's not fair to existing businesses that have
taken appropriate care. Please defeat H1575.

Dear Governor Perdue,

I'm writing to ask you to oppose H1575, Accelerate Remediation
at Industrial Sites.

Current state law requires companies that spill toxic chemicals
into soil and groundwater to clean them up to background levels.
H1575 would allow companies to walk away without fully cleaning
up their pollution if they put restrictions on future land use.
But in practice, those restrictions aren't going to be enforced
or even remembered years from now, leading to future public
health problems. Please protect public health and reject H1575.
