Subject: Bears in Cherokee

Comment: Hello, I am a registered voter in Swain County, and reside on the Qualla Boundary. You have received my support in the election, and I have been pleased with the work you have done so far for North Carolina. However, I must tell you that if you continue negotiations with Principal Chief Michelle Hicks while the issue with the Bears in the Bear Zoo remain unresolved, I will withdraw my support, and will actively campaign against any politician that looks the other way when acts of cruelty are being committed. I hope in time that there will be a resolution that everyone agrees with, before it's too late for the poor bears.

Subject: Bears in Cherokee need your help!

Comment: http://ravenzmoon.com/savethebears/ The Bears in Cherokee, NC need not only the governor's help but each and every person who cares about abuse against animals help. We have heard how these bears are treated like family. Look at the pictures of these bears in these so called zoos. would you treat a family member like that? It is called abuse and neglect. We would be locked up if we treated anyone like this and rightly so. In that there is a letter at the bottom of the pics...please copy or write your own and let the governor we want something done and now. Email everyone you know and let them know about the situation. This is not any organization but people not only in this country (USA) but international that are concerned for the bears welfare. This is the public and people of this land and others speaking out, making their voices heard. Abuse is not something we should turn our heads and pretend it does not exist. Abuse against any creature has to be stopped. It has to exposed for what it is...ABUSE. Lend a few minutes of your time and help us spread the word of what is happening. Let us pull together and let the government know laws need to be changed. Enough is enough and these bears have endured enough.

Subject: Cherokee Bear"Zoos"

Comment: Governor Perdue, When I was growing up in Weaverville, N. C., I was taken to Cherokee several times, and enjoyed the trip. At that time, in the early fifties, the bears were kept in cages much like the ones I've seen current pictures of. The only difference is, this is 2009, and they are still in the same ratty, broken down cages. None of these animals appear to be in good health, and their living arrangements, if you can call their existence "living" is abhorrent. Nothing has been done in over fifty years to improve the plight of these beautiful animals, and, thus far, nothing seems to be in the planning stages. What is the state of North Carolina doing, or going to do about this shameful treatment of animals in the hands of humans? It is expressed that the bears are treated like "family members", but I doubt either you or I would treat a family member with such cruelty. Please, try to address this issue, not for your sake, or my sake, but the health and lives of the bears. Thank you, Ripley A. Bradshaw Phone: 903.849.1968

Subject: Letter received from Gov Perdue re: Bear Grass Charter School

Comment: Appears to be inaccurancies in gov's letter to me dated 10/29/09..2nd paragraph - 3rd sentence......."North Carolina will reach its cap of 100 charter schools." It is my understanding that one charter school did not open for the 2009-2010 school year and another school may loose its' charter depending on the vote tomorrow (11/05/09). No one at the state level will be honest to concerned citizens about the Bear Grass Charter School Application. Again, the Bear Grass Charter Application was among the top three until the day of the vote. What happened at the State level that pushed Bear Grass out of the "running"? I really would like an honest explanation. All I have recieved from the top level is a form letter that many other Bear Grass concerned citizens received. Really indicates how caring the state level really is. Look forward to receiving a honest answer. Thank you.
