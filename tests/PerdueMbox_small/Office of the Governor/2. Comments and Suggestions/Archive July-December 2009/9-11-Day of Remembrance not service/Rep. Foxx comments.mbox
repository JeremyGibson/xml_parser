Dear Representative,

Dear Mrs. Perdue,
I recently came upon a video of Rep. Foxx's highly discriminatory, hate speech concerning the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 (H.R. 1913), in which she referred to the heinousness and brutal murder of Matthew Shepard as a "Hoax". This was inconceivable, and does it not go completely against a formal policy you have within your office prohibiting discrimination on the basis on sexual orientation and against your call that you would ensure that policy is administered throughout your state government. Do you not hold your representatives accountable for the same? 
I'm calling on you Governor Perdue to step out and call out Rep. Virginia Foxx and reprehend her actions in the most swift and arduous manor. Please don't let her words or actions toward this young man and his family go unnoticed. Please send a message to your State and your Country that this type discrimination, hate speech and lies is not tolerated. 

Thank you

Following is the question just received:
Visitor: Mr. Timothy Bagnell

Address: 5109 Stardust Dr., Durham, NC 27712

Email: tmbagnell@gmail.com

Subject: Rep. Foxx's comments

Comment: Madam Governor, The comments made today by NC Rep. Virginia Foxx or so beyond the scope of acceptable that it took me several minutes to calm down to try to write a cogent letter to you in regards to it. Her comparison of Healthcare Reform being more fearful to the American people than Terrorism deserves your direct condemnation. In light of what has occurred at Fort Hood, the deadliest attack against US troops on our own soil ever, her comparison is unconscionable! It is insensitive bordering on outright insulting. Now I am a realist, and I understand that you may not be able, or willing to give the sort of condemnation this remark deserves, but I ask you to please consider giving some sort of rebuke to Rep. Foxx. Please do this, if for no other reason than to stand in solidarity with the soldiers stationed in North Carolina who are right now grieving for the losses of their brothers and sisters-in-arms, and the horrendous betrayal they have suffered. Rep. Foxxâ€™s words belittle their pain and marginalize the efforts of all US troops. Sincerely, -Tim Bagnell
