Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, Lena Turbeville 12228 Jessica Pl Charlotte, NC 28269-1465

I find it sad that NC has such a weak law and that those who "represent me" had a part in weakening the law and or opposed any law. It is also sad that we must wait two and a half more month for the weakened law to take place. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending and strengthening our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. NC should move away from a tobacco economy as it is a killer and anti-life.

Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. We are thankful that soon we will be able to go into any restaurant without having our appetites ruined by the stench of smoke. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. My husband has to work with co-workers who smoke and has to turn on fans even in the winter to blow some of it away from his work area. He even has to eat his lunch with smokers all around. If the smoke-free policy were extended, he would be able to breathe more easily and probably have better health. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, Debra Raymond 8318 Smith Rd Kannapolis, NC 28081-8533

Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, Roger Boggs 6714 Cable Car Ln Wilmington, NC 28403-3667

In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation. We know having smoke-free restaurants and bars in North Carolina will prevent heart attacks and save lives. Extending our smoke-free policy to cover all workers would save even more lives. As your constituent, I invite you to read the new IOM report at www.iom.edu and consider the benefits of allowing all North Carolina workers to be protected by our smoke-free law. Thank you for your efforts to improve public health in North Carolina. Sincerely, valerie clasby 4303 Oakmoor Dr Greensboro, NC 27406-8675

Subject: All NC Workers Deserves Smoke-free Protection

Comment: Dear Governor Beverly Perdue: A new Institute of Medicine report confirms that smoke-free policies save lives. The report, released yesterday, verifies that secondhand smoke from cigarettes can cause acute coronary events such as heart attack and chest pain. This report follows an earlier study documenting that heart attack rates dropped 17 percent one year after implementation of smoke-free laws and continued to decline over time, with about a 36 percent drop three years after enacting the restrictions. Thanks to passage of HB2, North Carolinians can expect similar health benefits when our smoke-free policy is implemented in January. Studies like these demonstrate that smoke-free polices improve public health in many ways. In addition to protecting people from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, smoke-free laws also help reduce cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer in North Carolina and the nation.
