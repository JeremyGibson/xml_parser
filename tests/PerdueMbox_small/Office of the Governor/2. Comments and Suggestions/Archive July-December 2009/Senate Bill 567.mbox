Dear Governor Perdue,

I am writing to urge you to oppose Senate Bill 567.

We need to stop our dependence on the old energy ways! We need
energy efficiency, but we need renewable energy too. Please do
not allow this energy efficiency technology to count as a
renewable energy source. We not only need to cut down on the
amount of energy we use, and use the energy we have more
effectively, but we also need our energy to come from cleaner,
renewable sources.PLEASE make this a top priority for our state,
and do it now! Thank you!

I cannot believe in this year of major distress that the legislature and governor are considering raising taxes (again).  Where does it stop?  In tough times, we regular folks have to make hard choices  and cut back.  We don’t have some magic “tax” that will help us.  You even tax my unemployment benefits.  Now you are thinking of raising the sales tax by 1% along with an income tax surcharge because (luckily) my husband still has a decent job.  I am not satisfied that all was done to cut back and streamline as much as possible.  It seems to me we elect you people to do what is necessary and make the tough choices, especially now.  Come election time, my vote will be for the “other guy”.  Step up!!

Dear Governor Perdue,

As your constituent, I hope that you will oppose SB 567.

While smart grid energy efficiency technology is a good idea, it
is not a source of renewable energy. If passed as written,
Senate Bill 567 would totally undermine the state's renewable
energy standard.

This is a pretty simple matter of definition. Renewable energy
applies to energy derived from a source which is able to
replenish itself if harvested at an equal rate. This includes
wood, if trees are planted at the same rate they are cut down;
solar, which is naturally always present; as well as others like
wind and geothermal. However, smart-grid technology does not
fall into this category any more than caulk to seal in air
conditioning does. It isn't an energy source at all, but simply
a method of improving efficiency. It's certainly a good thing,
but terms are legally defined for this very reason: that
loopholes cannot be created to cheapen the costs of legislation
to large corporations and companies. I hope this is an easy
enough issue to resolve.

Thanks for your time.
