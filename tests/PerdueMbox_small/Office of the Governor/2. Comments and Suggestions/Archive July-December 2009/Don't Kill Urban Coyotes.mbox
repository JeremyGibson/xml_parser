Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Sprawl is a major issue in NC afftecting not only the quality of
life for people but life and death itself for its animal
inhabitants. Please demand better and stronger planning laws
that preserve the highest quality of life, and life itself, for
all of NC inhabitants...animal and human.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,
Cynthia Irvin

situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in

It has also been documented that the more a coyote population
declines, the more births occur due to a defense mechanism of
their reproductive cycle. The most effective deterrent to the
coyote population is the reintroduction and protection of the
larger predators such as the wolf. The coyote numbers have
increased to fill the vacancy of the erradicated larger
predators, and thus have overpopulated due to lack of
competition. The larger predators will remain away from humans,
if their territory is preserved &amp; protected, and the coyote
numbers will come under check as a result. Overkilling of
predator species started the problem; overkilling of scavengers
will only create new ones.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.

The coyotes, and the other animals, lived there first. When
their home disappears they are surely confused and scared. If
you could tell them the new program without killing them they
most likely would cooperate. Patience and compassion for those
who can not speak must be considered. Please help, before the

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

The animals were here long before we were. We need to give the
respect and the space in which they need to live successfully. I
want animals such as coyotes etc to be around for my children to
see and my grandchildren. We encroach upon their habitat, there
for we are the problem. We have to respect all equally humans
and animals. Animals have few rights as it is. That also needs
to be changed. Humans made the problem and now its time to be
responsible and correct our mistakes without harming wildlife.
They didnt harm us.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.

Dear Governor Perdue,

Sensationalist news reports across the country have been
documenting a rise in coyote attacks on humans in urban areas.
State wildlife divisions have been responding by attempting to
eliminate these so-called "urban coyotes" from the population.
But I feel we should instead be directing our resources to the
heart of the problem: urban sprawl.

As our cities get larger, they are increasingly taking over the
habitat of wild animals like coyotes. Rather than hunting down
and killing animals whose habitat has been destroyed by human
subdivisions, we should enact stronger urban planning laws that
protect the habitat of our nation's wildlife.

I urge you to work with the NC legislature and county
commissions to ensure that we humans do not further encroach on
wild lands. Strong urban planning laws are needed to prevent the
situations where animals like coyotes are forced to live in
urban environments when humans move in.

Thank you for your help in protecting NC's remaining wild lands
and animals.


Sincerely,
Diane Engles
