X-Folder: Public Health Case Management

Dear Mr. Yousey:



I have been asked to respond to your email with attached letter to Governor Perdue of September 3rd.† I appreciate the concerns expressed in your letter, and have communicated with Dr. Craigan Gray in the Division of Medical Assistance about your concerns.†



First, I hope you understand that the budgetary reductions faced by the Medicaid program is unprecedented.† In a period of economic decline, when the demands on the program are rapidly increasing, the Division of Medical Assistance is struggling to reduce spending this fiscal year by approximately $1.7 billion dollars.† This challenge is further complicated by the fact that the Medicaid program enrollment currently exceeds projections by approximately 10,000 enrollees.† The Legislature has specified a number of areas within the Medicaid budget that must be reduced.† Among the most difficult and largest reductions is case management.



It is the intent of the Department of Health and Human Services to examine opportunities to both increase efficiencies in the approach to service delivery as well as enhance the ability to better manage care to the benefit of the consumers of care.† This requires a close examination of current silos of care and making the effort to create a more comprehensive and collaborative approach to care.† It is important that every single provider of care under the Medicaid program be included in this process.



My communications with Dr. Gray and his staff clarifies that the objective of the Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) at ìintegratingî case management with Public Health is not to transfer functions. On the contrary, the objective is to coordinate the medical care of the covered beneficiaries with Public Health rather than having Public Health remain a ìstand aloneî health care organization in each community.† Working well with someone is not the same as being part of the health care vision of community data integration with others in the same region. ††This is an opportunity for each community CCNC network to work with their local health department to enhance the benefit for individuals receiving care and assistance in the community.† In fact, I am told this is already happening in several areas across the state.†



The Division of Medical Assistance is asking Public Health to integrate in the true sense of the word. ††Dr. Gray tells me there has been no ìoutright rejection of the DPH planî.† This comment miss-colors the facts.† There is, on the other hand, an energetic invitation for Public Health to fully integrate with the rest of the medical community to enhance the benefit for the citizens served.†† The Division has given Public Health a financial number of a 19.4% reduction, this believed to be a fair share based upon overall much greater reductions mandated by the Legislature.† Public Health has been asked to design their case management program to meet the outcome requirements.† DPH has complete freedom to move within the financial limits required of everyone.† Public Health retains ìownershipî of maternal/special children case management with information traveling in both directions (CCNCﬂ‡Public Health).



Through budgetary actions, the Department of Health and Human Services is mandated to generate lower costs for case management across every area of care because there are limited funds available, a simple accountable fact. †Case management is scattered all over the State, and has been developed over the years in a manner that none of the parties talk to each other in real coordination of their efforts.† The Division of Medical Assistance proposes that Public Health continue to case manage selected high-risk pregnant women, early intervention kids, and special needs kids in a contract relationship with the North Carolina Community Care Network (C3N).† The data firewalls will and should disappear between the two organizations.† These patient groups are part of the medical model and must not continue to be isolated in silos.† The Division of Medical Assistance acknowledges and appreciates the Public Health skill set in this area and is supporting complete freedom for Public Health to design and implement the revised program to meet the need of the beneficiary. ††The Division is asking CCNC to establish a ìpregnancy homeî which may be in the private or public sector to better manage the care.† Quality and outcome metrics will measure the process and progress.† Public Health is being asked to be part of the measurement process so that we may objectively determine the effectiveness of all our programs.† The Division of Medical Assistance is supporting payment on a pm/pm basis so that both DMA and DPH can have metric-based payment predictability.



Several observers inside and outside government have suggested that Public Health wants to remain isolated from the rest of the medical community doing ìtheir thingî the way they always have done it with no accountability other than to themselves.† If true, this is a risky posture in todayís rapidly changing times and dedicated movement toward better care management through the efficient and effective sharing of health care information among all care providers.† It is agreed that Public Health has done a respectable job with case management; however, it is important that we develop data to support an outstanding job.† Dr. Gray believes the proposed plan presented by Public Health is essentially a re-packaged old plan with nurses monitoring patients across the State with no new accountability for Public Health or the provider. ††We are asking Public Health to join all others in case management across the State to be part of the effort for full integration of doctors and nurses caring for the patient.†



CCNC and DMA need Public Healthís cooperation to do an outstanding job in case management and to really improve the obstetrical care in this state as well as deliver the cost savings required by the Legislature.† †As a dedicated physician who practiced OB/GYN for 27 years in North Carolina, Dr. Gray understands the importance of comprehensive maternity care.† DMA wants Public Health to be a real partner in this needed project. †It is recognized that CCNC does not have the case management capacity with these specific patient groups that Public Health has; however, CCNC does have the integration capacity to use the data, monitor the pregnancy home, and effect real, measurable, and needed improvements in pregnancy care.



We are indeed in challenging times.† I am convinced that, working cooperatively, we can exit these times stronger, more effective, and more efficient in delivering health care to the citizens of North Carolina.† I hope this information is helpful.† I look forward to working with Public Health in continuing to achieve our goals for the people of our state.



Sincerely,



Lanier Cansler

Subject: case management

Comment: I would like to ask for Governor Purdue's support in saving the Case Management Programs that are now a part of our local health departments across our state. We work with at-risk families in assisting with child and/or adult health concerns, information on child development, crisis intervention resources, housing, education, and planning for future employment. Cutting these needed programs would not only hurt our needy families, but the very heart of what public health is all about...reaching out to our community with services and resources. Please look at these programs and see the good that they bring to our community. It is vital that these positions remain in effect! Without early intervention we could see children beginning school that have all sorts of issues (i.e. developmental delays, behavioral issues, etc.) Is that what we want for our children? In the long run it will be our teacher's responsibilities for finding programs for these children with challenges. As if they didn't already have enough to do! Thank you for your support!

Comment: Governor Perdue I am contacting you about the reduction of case managers in the local health department.

They work to help women obtain prenatal care,WIC,transportation,counseling,food,housing,and are a great assest to the community. Please see that these programs are not cut. Your help is greatly appreciated. Rosa Foster

Subject: Case Management programs

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, House of Representatives and Senators, It has recently come to my attention that Case Management programs are up for review across the state and that DMA (Division of Medical Assistance) does not positively view these programs as a priority in these tough budget times. In my 16 years of Public Health service, I cannot think of a time when case management was ever more critical than now. Families across our state and nation are strapped, stressed, and desperate. Support systems make a difference between success and failure; life and death at times, and we need to be there for families in our community. Anyone who has had to navigate the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù knows how complicated it can be for the well informed, yet for those who need it the most the barriers can be insurmountable. Studies indicate when individuals have a strong support system, their outcomes are much more positive, as it pertains to mental or physical health, or just the personal drive to succeed and survive. I implore you to fight for Case Management programs that serve the most vulnerable in our community‚Ä¶that is the core of public service, and we must all fight for those less fortunate. Thank you.
