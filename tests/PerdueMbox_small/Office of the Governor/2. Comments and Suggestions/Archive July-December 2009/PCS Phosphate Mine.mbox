Please reply to Troy_lamson@yahoo.com

I want to express my sincere appreciation for your strong and visible support of PCS Phosphate as the company secured the permits necessary to allow it to continue its operations in Aurora, N.C.

While the 1,100 PCS Phosphate employees and approximately 1,000 contract workers are particularly grateful for your efforts, the successful outcome you helped provide on this issue will be felt not only in Beaufort County, but also Craven, Pamlico, Pitt and surrounding counties.

With the necessary permits and authorizations in-hand, PCS Phosphate will now be able to continue mining the phosphate deposit needed to make the products essential to everyday life, while holding true to a management philosophy that assures every North Carolinian that the company will strive to protect the environment for current and future generations.

Thank you again for your diligence and support on a critical issue for eastern North Carolina. Your leadership has been invaluable.

Please reply to tonylupton@yahoo.com

I want to express my sincere appreciation for your strong and visible support of PCS Phosphate as the company secured the permits necessary to allow it to continue its operations in Aurora, N.C.

While the 1,100 PCS Phosphate employees and approximately 1,000 contract workers are particularly grateful for your efforts, the successful outcome you helped provide on this issue will be felt not only in Beaufort County, but also Craven, Pamlico, Pitt and surrounding counties.

With the necessary permits and authorizations in-hand, PCS Phosphate will now be able to continue mining the phosphate deposit needed to make the products essential to everyday life, while holding true to a management philosophy that assures every North Carolinian that the company will strive to protect the environment for current and future generations.

Thank you again for your diligence and support on a critical issue for eastern North Carolina. Your leadership has been invaluable.
