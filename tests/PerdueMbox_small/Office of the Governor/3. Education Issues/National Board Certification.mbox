Governor Perdue,

Enough of your scare tactics and using education as the scapegoat for all the States mismanagement of its citizens assets (taxes).
Why don't you start with zero based budgeting and go from there? There are many legacy programs that no longer serve any useful purpose.                                                                                                         

Regards,
Ken Ray

> Gov. Perdue Calls on General Assembly to Protect Public Education in the State Budget

The state is currently facing a record budget shortfall of $4.7 billion.  Legislators are working hard to close the enormous gap, but there have been brutal cuts proposed to public education.  Cuts proposed so far to education are troubling: increases in class size and elimination of more than 6,000 thousand teachers and thousands more teaching assistants.

> Gov. Perdue this week continued to call on the General Assembly to make smart, tough cuts in the budget and to raise the revenue necessary to protect our classrooms.  She held rallies in Wilmington and Greenville on Monday and released a video message on Tuesday.

> Gov. Perdue Launches "United We Serve" Campaign

Gov. Bev Perdue this week announced that the Governor’s Office and the state’s departments and agencies will participate in United We Serve, a national effort launched by President Obama to engage more Americans in serving their communities this summer.

> “These 11 weeks are a time for North Carolinians to take the lead in organizing service projects and forging partnerships with local organizations to get their communities back on track,” Perdue said. “Whether you are working in a soup kitchen, reading to a child or helping out a friend in need, everyone’s small efforts can create some big results.”

> The campaign kicks off June 22 and runs through September 11, which will be marked for the first time as a national day of service and remembrance.  The initiative focuses on four key areas: education, health, community renewal, and energy and the environment.  It is being led by the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal agency that improves lives and strengthens communities through volunteering and service.

> The governor will focus on mentoring during the summer of service campaign.  Cabinet secretaries will volunteer with different nonprofits and advocacy groups throughout the summer as well.  The governor also encourages state employees to use their allotted 24 community service hours in support of the initiative and to help get North Carolina back on track.

> The Obama administration created <http://www.serve.gov/>www.serve.gov, a Web site that allows visitors to find local volunteer opportunities by typing in their zip code and allows organizations to recruit volunteers by posting their projects.

> Federal Energy Department OKs NC Plan to Use Recovery Fund to Create Green Jobs, Save Energy

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that the U.S. Energy Department has approved North Carolina’s $75.9 million Energy Plan to improve energy efficiency, promote greater use of renewable energy resources and create more green jobs.  The program will be funded through the state’s share of federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.

> “With this approval, North Carolina is prepared to quickly move ahead to create jobs and position our state to become a national leader in green energy,” said Gov. Perdue.  “I have directed the State Energy Office and other agencies to move as fast as possible to put these funds to work creating jobs and building North Carolina’s green economy.”

> Through ARRA funding to the State Energy Program, North Carolina is significantly increasing its investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, building its sustainable energy economy and workforce and promoting innovation and development of new energy technologies and resources.

> The federal Energy Department has given the state the go-ahead to start the program and spend $30.4 million.  The state will receive the remaining funds as it shows it has successfully implemented the plan.

> North Carolina is focusing on six areas for federal Recovery Act State Energy Program:

> - Supporting small businesses and industry through energy savings, 
> - Growing North Carolina’s green workforce through JobsNow, 
> - Developing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund, 
> - Improving government energy efficiency, 
> - Promoting residential energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 
> - Fostering renewable energy technology and resource innovation.

> “We will increase our energy efficiency, use new and emerging technologies; and develop creative partnerships with the private and nonprofit sectors,” Gov. Perdue said.

> Take Your Dog To Work Day

Today, June 26, is "Take Your Dog To Work Day."  The day was created to celebrate the great companions dogs make and to encourage pet adoptions.  Gov. Perdue was happy to participate.

> 
> Today she brought North Carolina's First Dogs, Dosie and Zipper, to work.  You can read more about these two Tibetan Terriers on <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstFamily/dosieZipper.aspx>their webpage.

> 31 Highway Contracts Awarded, Including 11 Recovery Projects

Gov. Bev Perdue announced this week that 31 contracts totaling $73 million have been awarded for highway and bridge projects across North Carolina, including 11 projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The contracts were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> “All of these projects will help generate new jobs and economic development for North Carolina, as well as improve travel throughout our state,” Perdue said.

> According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 million spent on transportation creates 30 jobs, and according to the construction industry, every dollar invested in transportation generates $6 in economic impact.

> The 11 recovery projects awarded are located in Bertie, Davidson, Davie, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Stokes, Transylvania and Watauga counties. The 20 other projects awarded are located in Anson, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Granville, Henderson, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, New Hanover, Polk, Sampson, Stanly, Transylvania, Warren and Yancey counties. Work on all contracts will start in July.

> For a list of the projects and for more information visit <http://ncrecovery.gov/News/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=42>NCRecovery.gov.

> Cleveland County Manufacturer to Add 114 Jobs

Baldor Electric Co., an international supplier of industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators, will expand its Kings Mountain operations.  The company plans to invest more than $12.2 million and create 114 jobs during the next three years.  The announcement was made possible in part by a $157,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.

> “North Carolina’s manufacturing sector remains strong and diverse,” Gov. Perdue said.  “Our state is attractive to growing companies because of our highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate and tremendous quality of life.”

> Baldor Electric Co., headquartered in Arkansas, operates 26 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, Mexico and China and provides products to more than 70 countries. Three of the company’s plants are in North Carolina, in Kings Mountain, Marion and Weaverville, employing a combined workforce of nearly 700 people.

> Baldor is consolidating operations from South Carolina and moving those manufacturing processes to facilities in other states, including the Kings Mountain plant, which currently employs more than 500 workers.  The 114 new jobs added over the next three years will pay an average wage of $38,329, not including benefits, which is higher than the Cleveland County average of $31,720.

Subject: [Aid4Mail Trial tag #5464] Caldwell St. Proposed project Brevard NC
Date: Tue, 14 Jul 2009 10:47:09 -0400
To: sjwilliams@ncdot.gov, jfreeman@cityofbrevard.com

	Dear Mr. Williams

	As a nine  year resident of Brevard, I must question the sensibility  
of the proposed widening of a beautiful, usually quiet street near  
downtown Brevard.
There are many roads into and out of this small town which are more  
than adequate to move traffic through this lovely little town.    
Certainly Highway 64 which parallels Caldwell St. with its multi- 
lanes and turn-lanes is more than adequate to accommodate traffic  
through our city.

	During times of economic distress, when our state government is  
suffering a 4.7 billion dollar shortfall, our legislators propose  
cuts in needed services to the elderly and the financially  
disadvantaged and , of course, education.   As Gov. Perdue said  
recently,   "We are now at a crossroads.  We can choose to protect  
core education, public safety and health care services, or we can  
allow the economic crisis to cripple our classrooms."

	When our state leaders have to make hard choices about which  
programs to keep and which to discard, it is extremely upsetting to  
have to spend time debating the necessity of a frivolous road  
widening project like this one.   Let's keep our priorities straight  
and put these funds where they are most needed.
We don't need to destroy the charm of yet another downtown  
neighborhood in order to keep the DOT busy.

	Please put these comments in the public record.   Thanks for your  
attention.

New Resources Examine Key Elements of National Health Reform Proposals

The Kaiser Family Foundation today issued several new resources related to
the national debate about comprehensive health reform:

* How Might a Reform Plan Be Financed? examines the challenges of paying for
a major reform plan, including a look at some of the options under
consideration by Congressional leaders. The brief explains the various
approaches being discussed to finance the likely costs of the health reform
plans under consideration. It is part of the Foundation's series of
Explaining Health Care Reform briefs and can be found at
<http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7947.cfm.>http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7947.cfm.

* Key Questions about Changes for Medicaid and Low-Income Individuals:
American's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 summarizes the Medicaid and
Children's Health Insurance Program provisions included in H.R.3200,
America's Affordable Health Choices Act, otherwise known as the
Tri-Committee bill. It also looks at some key questions about the
legislation's provisions affecting low-income individuals. It can be found
at <http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7952.cfm.>http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7952.cfm.

* Summary of Key Medicare Provisions in H.R. 3200, America's Affordable
Health Choices Act of 2009 provides a detailed look at the provisions in the
House Tri-Committee bill that affect the Medicare program, including
breakouts of the savings and new spending included in the bill. It can be
found at <http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7948.cfm.>http://www.kff.org/healthreform/7948.cfm.

In addition, the Foundation has updated its interactive side-by-side health
reform comparison tool, which can be found at
<http://www.kff.org/healthreform/sidebyside.cfm,>http://www.kff.org/healthreform/sidebyside.cfm, to reflect changes to the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee proposal. The online
tool allows users to compare any of 11 different plans, including the House
Tri-Committee legislation and the Senate Finance Committee policy options.

All these resources are available through the Foundation's health reform
gateway page at <http://healthreform.kff.org/,>http://healthreform.kff.org/, which provides a centralized
source for key information and analysis about national health reform efforts
now being considered by Congress. The gateway also includes original policy
and public-opinion research, columns from Kaiser President Drew Altman, and
relevant news summaries produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially
independent health policy news service established by the Foundation.

President Obama requesting the U. S. Congress change
U. S.  Stock Market Regulations.

The Huffington Post.
By: MARCY GORDON
08/11/09 08:53 PM

[ President ] "Obama Proposes New Derivatives Rules."

"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Tuesday
[ August 11, 2009 ] sent Congress legislation seeking to
impose broad new oversight on derivatives,  the complex
financial instruments blamed for hastening the global
economic crisis."

"The plan is designed to bring transparency to,  and prevent
manipulation in,  a  $600 trillion unregulated worldwide
market.  Credit default swaps, a form of insurance
against loan defaults,  account for an estimated $60 trillion
of that market."

"The collapse of the swaps brought the downfall
of Wall Street banking house Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  and nearly toppled American International
Group Inc.  [ AIG ]   last fall,  prompting the government to
support the insurance conglomerate with about $180 billion
in aid."

Please forward this email to others.

Thank you,

Robert

( Naked Long and Short Stock and other Naked Items)
traded on the  U. S. Stock Markets and World Financial
Markets.

The U. S. Government have 65 Independent Agencies

Some of these 65  U. S. Independent Agencies
that are Supervised and Controlled by the

With our present   21st Century Computers operating at

Meester Page:  I am forwarding your evaluation of my mental health onto the whole world so we all can see the manner in which you deal with unruly constituents.  I would note that you are absolutely right...the conspiracy between city county and state officials to oppress me in the exercise of my Constitutional rights and to obstruct justice in denying me access to redress to a determination of probable cause under federal statute has driven me off the deep end.  Everyobdy in Durham knew that I was crazy before this (go ask Ron Evans, he told me so himself), but standing alone in trying to overthrow a Constitutionally corrupt city county andstate government who has no respect for the Constitution (and how is this any different from Boyd?) has completely pushed me over the edge.  I have no life, I suffer from depression, nightmares, flashbacks, post-traumatic stress syndrome, I have gained 100 lbs. since I was at the back of the PD, I am now an alcoholic,
 and I frequently think this is a way to commit slow suicide (even though I've never told anybody this before, it's true).  This is what you people have done.  I am also a Born-again Christian and I am doing God's work.  You church people are an abomination.  Thanks for poking the sore spots.

Talk to you tomorrow.

I don't think so! I was upset over the inmate housing unit in Wilmington closing, the last of the inmates left today! She has no CLUE how she just changed so many lives...she is so disconnected from those of us who helped elect her, biggest mistake I ever made and will not make again, next term it's a Republican, no matter who it is! She says she signed the latest bill, reluctantly......has she no mind of her own? We, the constituents, voice to her what works, the reason she is in office is that we elected her, I had no connection with these inmates but as I stated in my prior email, at one time I had a daughter in prison and had she been in long enough I would have hoped she would have had this opportunity....I just want the next 3 years to hurry by.....I also wonder how so many states dont even have state income tax and yet she just signed into law ours to increase by 1%. It's not because of the sales tax because ours just went up again t! oo...I'd rather pay the sales tax than the higher income tax, I'm getting ready to lose my job because of 'reduction of force' which means I may get a severence, probably half of which will be absorbed in income tax both federal and state but yet on paper it will appear I have that to live on. Try being an insulin dependent diabetic with no insurance......thanks Gov Perdue! Sleep well...I just get so tired of hearing that we elect the officials to do our will, we really have no say.

Dear Staff Member,
       In your response to my earlier email you said that the govennor would keep my suggestions in mind. What suggestions? I offered none. I simply wanted to know why the down east area of Carteret County wasn't included in any of the grant money that was mainly distributed in the mid to western sections of the state. In fact, I would like to know where any of the stimulus money was spent in Carteret County, a county that supported her candancy and helped her win the office. I would think she would give us some consideration as it is an area she is most familiar with and is personally aware of its high jobless rate and economic deprivation.
If I had any suggestions, they would be not to cater to the tourist industry that lobbys so hard to keep other industries out. Minimun wage, service type jobs are not what we need. Our young people are leaving while up state tourists fill the pockets of hotel/motel, restaurant, Wal-mart, and other merchants that cater to beach goer's needs. Tourism is a large part of our economy, but should it be the exclusive part of it? Cherry Point is our only source of career type jobs and those are limited.
While I appreciate that Gov. Perdue played a role in keeping the base open, I wish she would give some attention to bringing much needed industry into this area. Also, if she's looking for "shovel ready" projects, plenty abound on our highway/roadway system down here. (And what about that 25 year old Beaufort draw bridge replacement project?) Could the tourist industry have anything to do with the obstruction of that? Just asking, or wondering.
Help, we need real help, not lip service.
If your standard, generic reply to all emails is the way in which you plan to answer, please save both your time and mine. Time is money, you know.
Betsy Lawrence

I am not happy that she agreed to sign anything that increased my taxes in this economy. She caved on the citizens of NC

>>                      I have had it with you and your administration, sir.  Your conduct on your recent trip overseas has convinced me that you are not an adequate representative of the   United States of America collectively or of me personally.
>> 
>>                      You are so obsessed with appeasing the Europeans and the Muslim world that you have abdicated the responsibilities of the President of the United States of America .  You are responsible to the citizens of the United States ..  You are not responsible to the peoples of any other country on earth.
>> 
>>                      I personally resent that you go around the world apologizing for the United States telling Europeans that we are arrogant and do not care about their status in the world.  Sir, what do you think the First World War and the Second World War were all about if not the consideration of the peoples of   Europe ?  Are you brain dead?  What do you think the Marshall Plan was all about?  Do you not understand or know the history of the 20th century?
>> 
>>                      Where do you get off telling a Muslim country that the   United States does not consider itself a Christian country?  Have you not read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution of the   United States ?  This country was founded on Judeo-Christian ethics and the principles governing this country, at least until you came along, come directly from this heritage.  Do you not understand this?
>> 
>>                      Your bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia is an affront to all Americans.  Our President does not bow down to anyone, let alone the king of Saudi Arabia .  You didn't show Great Britain , our best and one of our oldest allies, the respect they deserve yet you bow down to the king of Saudi Arabia .  How dare you, sir!  How dare you!
>> 
>>                      You cant find the time to visit the graves of our greatest generation because you don't want to offend the Germans but make time to visit a mosque in Turkey ...  You offended our dead and every veteran when you give the Germans more respect than the people who saved the German people from themselves.  What's the matter with you? I am convinced that you and the members of your administration have the historical and intellectual depth of a mud puddle and should be ashamed of yourselves, all of you..
>> 
>>                      You are so self-righteously offended by the big bankers and the American automobile manufacturers yet do nothing about the real thieves in this situation, Mr.. Dodd, Mr. Frank, Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelic, the Fannie Mae bonuses, and the Freddie Mac bonuses. What do you intend to do about them?  Anything?  I seriously doubt it.
>> 
>>                      What about the U.S. House members passing out $9.1 million in bonuses to their staff members on top of the $2.5 million in automatic pay raises that lawmakers gave themselves?  I understand the average House aide got a 17% bonus.  I took a 5% cut in my pay to save jobs with my employer.  You haven't said anything about that.  Who authorized that?  I surely didn't!
>> 
>>                      Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be receiving $210 million in bonuses over an eighteen-month period, that's $45 million more than the AIG bonuses.  In fact, Fannie and Freddie executives have already been awarded $51 million not a bad take.  Who authorized that and why haven't you expressed your outrage at this group who are largely responsible for the economic mess we have right now?
>> 
>>                      I resent that you take me and my fellow citizens as brain-dead and not caring about what you idiots do.  We are watching what you are doing and we are getting increasingly fed up with all of you.  
>> 
>>                      I also want you to know that I personally find just about everything you do and say to be offensive to every one of my sensibilities.  I promise you that I will work tirelessly to see that you do not get a chance to spend two terms destroying my beautiful country.

Subject: PUERTO RICO: OPERATION S.T.O.M.P.









HONORABLE BARACK OBAMAÂ 

Â    THE WHITE HOUSEÂ 

1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUEÂ 

N.W WASHINGTON, D.C.  20500Â 
Â 

Â 

HONORABLE BARACK OBAMA,Â 
Â 

THE SILA MARIA CALDERON PASS ADMINISTRATION AND THE ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA
ADMINISTRATION PASS ADMINISTRATIONÂ 

ALONG WITH THE ENTIRE PARTIDO POPULAR DEMOCRATICO( PPD) have been in
involved with LA POLICIA DE PUERTOÂ 

RICO in false imprisonment of any one who cross the path of their
political views. They have the men imprisoned inÂ 

BAYAMON CORRECTIONAL PRISON OR OSO BLANCO ( LAS MARVINAS) where they
are tortured, beat, maced, andÂ 

locked up 23 hours a day with little food to eat and half a hour to
shower. prisoners are not allowed to read or haveÂ 

any rights to visitors, or write letters to the outside world and are
constantly harassed by prison guards who alsoÂ 

bring drugs into the correc
tional system to addict inmates to drugs so
they can profit from drug sales. during myÂ 

tour of duty in Puerto Rico, OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. was involved in the
internal investigations of corruption inÂ 

LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO and have LINKED this political corruption to
The PPD PARTY, CHIEF OF POLICE:Â 

PEDRO TOLEDO, SILA MARIA CALDERON, ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA AND THE
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM HEAD.Â 

while sending Vital information to THE WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION in CAROLINA, PRÂ 

LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO Invaded my home and cut the locks off my gate
and dragged me out of myÂ 

home in underwear only and beat me with a 36" night stick and placed my
head on the ground like ifÂ 

my head were a GOLF BALL and used the 36" nightstick as a GOLF CLUB and
struck me on the left sideÂ 

of my head and said this is what you get for writing to BILL CLINTON
and after they beat me they threwÂ 

me inside a van and said" vamos a llevar este al CALVARIO, a secret
place LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICOÂ 

use in TRUJILLO ALTO, PR to torture Federal Agents, U.S. NAVY VETERANS
and anyone who gets inÂ 

the Way of Police Chief, Pedro Toledo! as they entered The torture site
I seen Two " MEN IN BLACK"Â 

BLOCK the police van from behind and the police started to panic and
backed up from entering" EL CALVARIO"Â 

and rushed me to The Emergency Room o
f THE SAN JUAN VETERANS
ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL CENTERÂ 

and made up a false police report and left. I was hospitalized for 3
months. when I was released I continuedÂ 

OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. and built a LETHAL WEAPONS: A LASER mounted on a
vehicle as a demo modelÂ 

to show LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO what U.S. NAVAL TECHNOLOGY they were
up against on theÂ 

streets of Puerto Rico and even took out the weapon to show LA POLICIA
DE PUERTO RICO In Carolina,Â 

Puerto Rico what they were up against. LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO In
Carolina, PR IMMEDIATELYÂ 

wanted training on this weapon and I refused to expose U.S. NAVAL
SECRETS to them. so one nightÂ 

THE ENTIRE Commandancia de Carolina, PR surrounded my home with swat,
helicopters, fire department,Â 

etc. in an attempt to confiscate my weapon, which was just a demo
model. The fire department rushedÂ 

the gates of my home and cut the locks as police tried to storm the
front. I immediately fought backÂ 

this illegal entry into my home without any search warrants or legal
authorization from The Puerto RicoÂ 

Government and start throwing cans from my pantry at police and
immediately jumped into myÂ 

weapon and locked the doors. police immediately took cover fearing the
weapon was armed andÂ 

read the project label on back of the vehicle which read: NASA: PEDRO
ROSSELLO ADMINISTRATION.Â 

LA POLICIA DE20PUERTO RICO were immediately ordered to stand down when
they realized theÂ 

weapon was just a model and did not have the power source to arm the
weapon: LITHIUM BATTERY.Â 

They immediately were ordered to take me to The San Juan Veterans
Administration Medical CenterÂ 

for Observation. I was hospitalized for 2 months and later released.
upon returning home OPERATIONÂ 

S.T.O.M.P. was advancing on LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO using Night
Vision Military EquipmentÂ 

and starting filming Vital Areas in Puerto Rico In The Interest of
National Security for The U.S.Â 

Federal Government. for my family's security I moved to VEGA BAJA,
PUERTO RICO as TheÂ 

SILA MARIA CALDERON ADMINISTRATION and THE PDP PARTY CAME INTO POWER.
LA POLICIAÂ 

DE PUERTO RICO were getting hammered with constant reports to WILLIAM
JEFFERSONÂ 

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION until LA MARINA FUERA DE VIEQUES SITUATION when
SILA MARIAÂ 

CALDERON got fed up with OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. AND THE U.S. NAVY and
ordered LA POLICIAÂ 

DE PUERTO RICO TO KILL ME anywhere they could find me in PUERTO RICO.
Early one MorningÂ 

in Front of The Capital in SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO in the middle of a
Large coward protestingÂ 

MARINA FUERA DE VIEQUES, A WOMEN, FROM LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO
ATTEMPTEDÂ 

TO ASSASSINATE ME in her police cruiser while I drove by The protest in
front of the capital.Â 

SHE POI
NTED HER SERVICE REVOLVER directly to my head as I drove pass
the police cruiserÂ 

and before she can fire the shot I attempted to ram the police cruiser
and The people inÂ 

the street spotted the action and this led to a high speed car chase
for a short distanceÂ 

as I TOOK COVER from any bullets flying pass me as the police cruiser
rammed the side ofÂ 

my vehicle causing both vehicles to spin off the road. The crowd
observed police trying toÂ 

KILL ME and immediately surrounded the police in a riot mode and
started shouting atÂ 

police to leave me alone. LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO then began to brake
the windowsÂ 

of my vehicle and dragged me out of the vehicle, took me to the police
station and immediatelyÂ 

released me when they found out that I was a U.S. NAVY VETERAN. when
SILA MARIA CALDERONÂ 

LEARNED that The ASSASSINATION PLOT FAILED, she ordered out another hit
out on meÂ 

and this time ordered THE STATE POLICE TO find me because she knew I
was on foot aloneÂ 

in The streets of SAN JUAN, PR. I Thought I would be safe in The
tourist areas of Condado, SAN JUANÂ 

until I could get back to VEGA BAJA, PR , so I hid there. AT 2:00 a.m.
the next morning I wasÂ 

waiting at PLAZA DE ANCHOR, CONDADO, SAN JUAN when The State Police
spotted me sittingÂ 

on a bench. they yelled, "there he is"! as they ad
vanced on me punching
me in the face and draggingÂ 

me to the ground. they then began to kick me, punch me in the face,
slap me. they then removedÂ 

my clothes and left me in underwear and placed two handcuffs behind my
back. they then beganÂ 

to drag me to the beach were they put sand in my eyes, ears and mouth
and attempted toÂ 

drag me to the water to drown me. I fought off The attack using my Body
weight and legsÂ 

and knocked two officers to The ground in GREEN UNIFORM as some tourist
passed by and observedÂ 

what the police were doing. when The police looked into my wallet they
found MILITARY DOG TAGSÂ 

and a Federal I.D. and immediately pulled down my underwear and
attempted to burn off my penisÂ 

and testicles on a hot lamp on the grounds reaching 110 degree in
temperature and as I feltÂ 

the hot lamps touch my penis and testicles I used all My strength and
Body weight to push theÂ 

one police women and three male officers backwards landing in the
SITTING POSITION on topÂ 

of THE HOT LAMP as I yelled while the lamp burned a deep hole in my
butt and I passed outÂ 

for a few seconds due to this inhuman torture with two handcuffs behind
my back. STATEÂ 

POLICE immediately threw me into a STATE POLICE CRUISER and rushed me
to The San JuanÂ 

Veterans Administration Medical Center and Put me in the E
mergency Room
and didn't evenÂ 

inform VA POLICE. they told The Emergency Room That They Found Me
walking aroundÂ 

Condado, SAN JUAN naked. I was HOSPITALIZED for three months or so and
THE SAN JUAN, VAMCÂ 

failed to investigate the incident with THE STATE POLICE! when I came
out of THE SAN JUAN, VAMCÂ 

my insurance company sued LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO For $7,000 dollars
in damages to myÂ 

vehicle and I tried to sue the police With an attorney from Santurce,
PR  The attorney who wasÂ 

going to handle the case was later found shot multiple times with a
CRACK PIPE and CRACK onÂ 

his desk in his office and nobody knows who did it! SILA MARIA CALDERON
heard the news onÂ 

how THE STATE POLICE failed to assassinate me and she put out a hit on
me using The EntireÂ 

PDP PARTY CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. One afternoon I was cruising down PR
I-22 when IÂ 

was being followed by many vehicles and when I got to BAYAMON, PR I was
getting readyÂ 

to toss 35 cents into the tow booth when all of a sudden a State
Trooper starts shootingÂ 

into the air and immediately takes aim at my chess! before he can take
the shot I immediatelyÂ 

threw my vehicle into over drive and managed to" J TURN" MY VEHICLE,
LIKE THE U.S. SECRETÂ 

SERVICE TRAINING FILMS and my vehicles was facing the other direction
and the shot firedÂ 

by The
 State Trooper hit the passenger side front tire and blew it out
as I put the PETALÂ 

TO THE METAL and hauled out of there at 80 m.p.h. on three wheels. A
high speed carÂ 

chase followed with over 20 STATE TROOPERS chasing me on the opposite
direction ofÂ 

PR 1-22 TOWARDS ARECIBO,PR. after Observing the actions of THE STATE
POLICEÂ 

and their intend to assassinate me, I decided to pull over after
witnesses were present.Â 

STATE POLICE THEN ATTEMPTED TO BREAK MY MOUTH AND TEETH by smashingÂ 

my face to the ground as they arrested me and Charged me with ATTEMTPED
ASSASSINATIONÂ 

OF A STATE TROOPER AND THE JUDGE SET BAIL AT $100,000 DOLLARS AND IÂ 

WAS LOCKED UP IN OSO BLANCO PRISON, MAXIMUM SECURITY. when THE U.S.Â 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE got involved in The Case, They Found The Bullet
whichÂ 

the STATE TROOPER FIRED INTO MY VEHICLE and when the case got to court
TheÂ 

15 year old STATE TROOPER VETERANS denied firing his SERVICE REVOLVER
under oathÂ 

and the JUDGE knew it was A LIE because of reports from the Justice
Department andÂ 

immediately reduced the charge to AGGRESSATION and sentenced me to 6
months andÂ 

SILA MARIA CALDERON Some how deleted The charges From my criminal
records toÂ 

cover up THE ASSASSINATION PLOT!  When I got out of prison SILA MARIA
CALDERONÂ 

gave me a piece of land in VEGA BAJA,=2
0PR to try to cover up her action
and I went toÂ 

ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO to accept her offer and as she was marching down
the streetÂ 

in ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO I JUMPED IN FRONT OF THE CROWD AND GRABBED HERÂ 

BY THE HANDS AS POLICE DREW THEIR WEAPONS AND POINTED IT AT ME ANDÂ 

I SAID TO SILA MARIA CALDERON, FACE TO FACE, CHEEK TO CHEEK," DO YOUÂ 

REMEMBER ME"??? SHE TURNED PALE AS A GHOST AND ANSWERED " PERO SEGUROÂ 

OUE SI! and immediately ordered LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO TO STAND 
DOWN!Â 

THIS INICIDENT WAS CAUGHT LIVE ON T.V. AND FILM AT THAT HOUR. SILAÂ 

MARIA CALDERON was so frighten by this close encounter of a person she
orderedÂ 

to be assassinated that she informed The next Governor of PUERTO RICO
of theÂ 

Problem she was having with OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. when ANIBAL ACEVEDOÂ 

VILA sneaked into Power he too thought he could overcome OPERATION
S.T.O.M.P.Â 

AS the GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THE C.I.A. THOUGHT that myÂ 

Operation was A GAME and let LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICO do what they
wantedÂ 

to do with me. SO ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED A COUNTERÂ 

ATTACK ON OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. AND USED LA POLICIA DE PUERTO RICOÂ 

IN VEGA BAJA, PR AND IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED THE LAND SILA MARIAÂ 

CALDERON GAVE ME WITH S.W.AT. TEAMS AND HELICOPTERS, AK-47, M-16, R-15,Â 

9MM, SHOTGUNS,TASERS, AND20FORCE ME TO SURRENDER MY LAND BY FORCEÂ 

BY THE ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA ADMINISTRATION AS POLICE ENTERED MY HOMEÂ 

BEAT ME AND DRAGGED ME OFF TO BAYAMON CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM ON FALSEÂ 

CHARGES IN ORDER TO CUT OFF MY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND VETERANSÂ 

COMPENSATION SO MY FAMILY WOULD NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY THE BILLSÂ 

AND FORCE MY HOME TO GO INTO FORECLOSURE. A CLEVER PLAN BY THE ANIBALÂ 

ACEVEDO VILA ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE ME THROWN OUT OF PUERTO RICOÂ 

AS THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS CONTACTED FOR 18 MONTHSÂ 

BEHIND PRISON WALLS OF THIS POLITICAL MATTER. after being released fromÂ 

prison as A POLITICAL PRISONER, ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA was indicted BY THE
F.B.I.Â 

for crimes against  EL PUEBLO DE PUERTO RICO. OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. was
forcedÂ 

to leave PUERTO RICO due to lack of support From THE GEORGE W. BUSH
ADMINISTRATIONÂ 

and continues to OPERATE despite of RACIST  GEORGE W. BUSH! OPERATION
S.T.O.M.P.Â 

is currently serving THE BARACK OBAMA ADMINISTRATION with Hopes of
CHANGE forÂ 

PUERTO RICO and knows what ASSASSINATION PLOTS are involved in CHANGE
forÂ 

OPERATION S.T.O.M.P. has tasted THE CUP OF DEATH and vows to leave TheÂ 

vengeance TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD! FOR THE PUERTO RICAN GOVERNMENT WILLÂ

I took the liberty of removing EVERYONE'S name, email address, and comments. If you forward, please do the same. If you do not know how to delete others' names and addresses, do not forward. r

Incidentally, I met a beautiful, older lady last Saturday. We were both waiting for the rain to stop so we would not get soaked going to our cars. As we waited, we shared glimpses of our past. She was a retired school teacher, and her demeanor was one of a very gracious, intelligent lady. In the course of chatting, she revealed she was the daughter of a half white, half black mother, and a black father. She showed me a picture of her mother, who most definitely could pass for "white", as she herself could pass for another nationality. I say this to share that we had a wonderful conversation, especially about segregation, intergration, etc. etc. We both had painful memories, as well as wonderful ones. She most decidedly is an AMERICAN, as much as I am. We had far more in common, than any differences, despite the fact she had a bit more skin pigment than I. Racists, be they black, white, red, yellow, or a mix thereof, would never understand, for indeed, racism is ! a matter of the heart, and not that of pigment, or lack thereof. Small, hardened hearts come in all sizes, shapes, COLORS, and nationalities! r

The Governor should have stayed on the bus and rode it right out of the state and taken the tax and spend and raise taxes Democrats with her. One penny may not seem like much to you people that have money, but to the working class and poor this adds up over time and the 2011 expiration date of the tax will never happen and will eventually become law, just like Easley did during his time in office. You people are as crooked as he.

The sales tax that goes into effect on 9--1-09, is criminal, especially in times when NC unemployment is so high. I, as will many of my friends and neighbors will do every thing we can to purchase as much as we can out of this progressive/liberal state.

You people make me sick.

> BRAC Budget Reform Commission Meets, Launches New Webpage

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday convened the first meeting of the Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC) and launched a new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov, so that citizens may make recommendations to the commission.

> “As North Carolina continues to be deeply affected by this national recession, state government must ensure that every tax dollar is used as efficiently and wisely as possible,” Perdue said.  “I look forward to working with BRAC members to meet these challenges head-on, without shying away from politically tough decisions.”

> Perdue established BRAC in January via <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/ExecutiveOrderDetail.aspx?newsItemID=429>Executive Order #5 to locate and eliminate wasteful expenditures while increasing efficiency in government.

> In the short term, the commission is expected to come up with ideas that can be enacted quickly to help the state save money.  Its goal will be to have recommendations in time for next year’s legislative short session.

> In the long term, BRAC will examine state government and make innovative recommendations to:

> • eliminate unnecessary or unsuccessful programs;
> • consolidate where possible and ensure we are investing effectively and efficiently;
> • and to streamline the way state government works.

> Suggestions for initiatives that BRAC will consider may come from a variety of sources, including state agencies, BRAC members, and from the public at large.  The commission also urges citizens to make recommendations using the new Webpage, <http://brac.nc.gov>brac.nc.gov.

> Governor Rides the Bus for the First Day of School

Gov. Perdue on Tuesday took the bus to school with kids from Conn Elementary in Raleigh.  She talked with parents and excited kids waiting for the bus on their first day back from summer vacation.  When she arrived at the school, Gov. Perdue visited classrooms, spoke with teachers and addressed the students on the school's morning TV news show.

> Governor Fully Restores School Lottery Funds

Gov. Bev Perdue today announced she is fully restoring funds to the lottery capital fund for public schools.

> “When the national recession created a shortfall of billions of dollars, I had to turn over every stone to pay North Carolina’s bills — to pay teachers, to keep schools and other core services running,” Perdue said. “With our bills paid and the books for last fiscal year cleared out, I’m restoring the school construction lottery funds in full, which means North Carolina’s public schools will receive another $37.6 million next week.”

> In February, Perdue withheld $37.6 million during the 2008-09 fiscal year from the Public School Building Capital Fund to ensure the state had sufficient resources to manage cash flow and payroll obligations. That money is being restored using funds left over from the 2008-09 fiscal year.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=594>> Click here for a list of funds going to each county.

> Gov. Perdue Signs Bill to Attract More Film Industry Jobs

Gov. Bev Perdue on Thursday signed Senate Bill 943 allowing production companies a 25 percent tax credit for film projects in North Carolina, up from the previous credit of 15 percent.  The bill also sets minimum spending and hiring requirements for qualifying film companies working in the state.

> “This legislation will help grow our $91 million motion picture industry, preserve and create thousands of jobs and increase investments in yet another emerging economic cluster,” said Perdue. “Providing a strong foundation for North Carolina’s film industry is essential as we work to build a strong and sustainable economy through increased diversification.”

> SB 943 ensures North Carolina remains a strong competitor for film production dollars, which totaled $91 million in direct spending in 2008.  The industry employs more than 2,500 statewide.  Recent major motion pictures filmed in the state include “Nights in Rodanthe,” “Leatherheads” and “The Secret Life of Bees.”  The N.C. film industry is also home to the CW Network’s “One Tree Hill” TV series as well as hundreds of commercial and industrial productions each year throughout the state.

> More than 800 movies have been filmed in North Carolina.  The state is well known for supporting its motion picture industry with a strong infrastructure and a bevy of locations that can stand in for sites throughout the world.  North Carolina boasts an exceptional variety of filming locations from the mountains to the coast, and a world-class film industry infrastructure. Wilmington’s EUE Screen Gems, home of the largest studio lot east of California, recently opened the largest film and television production soundstage on the East Coast.

> For more details on the N.C. Film Office, go to: <http://www.ncfilm.com/>http://www.ncfilm.com/.

> Gov. Perdue Announces 45 New Jobs at Sara Lee

Gov. Bev Perdue on Wedneday announced that Sara Lee will be creating 45 new jobs at their factory in Tarboro. The new jobs come from an $11 million capital investment by Sara Lee for the addition of an equipment line to make biscuits.

> “Sara Lee’s $11 million investment in North Carolina is a testament to our state’s top-rated business climate,” said Perdue. “And because of our strong and talented workforce Sara Lee will continue to expand its operations here.”

> Sara Lee currently employees 808 people at its Tarboro factory. The Tarboro facility was just awarded “Plant of the Year” by Sara Lee. The biscuit production will add five million lbs to the 97 million lbs of food product the facility turns out every year.

> Governor's schedule for the coming week

The great huamnity made the entire world surprise !
the definition of iron woman is that do not want the face which is as same as iron ,
black dog's hooker! the greatest hitler is hillary clinton! she is badest woman in the world!!!!!!
aalborg university in denmark is badest university in the world!!!!!!!
they never dare to repair all student's webapge , because of the fact which the teacher and 
hillary clinton persecuted the student!!!!!!!!!!
the tradition of aalborg university is that each student's webpage is on the webpage of each departmentfor many years
they removed the student's webpage after they persecuted the student

the  previous head(peter axel nielsen) of counpter science department at aalborg university lost his leader position 
because of the student's phd application, 
then he used hillary clinton to command many american policeman to persecuted the student
the tradition of aalborg university is each student's webpage in each webpage of every department!
if they repair the all student's webpage, then the student know the fact which the professor and hillary clinton persecuted the student,
 then they have no the face to teach the students.
in order to recover the fact which the professor and hillary clinton persecuted the student
, obama  appointed Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO's new secretary-genera

Visitor: Mr. James Hester

Address: 8206-1200 Providence Road, Charlotte, NC 28277

Email: jhesterj@carolina.rr.com

Subject: Tax Increase of 5.5%

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, I am very disappointed in you and the legislative body of North Carolina. Charlotte sales tax rates moves to 8.25%, if you eat out in a restaurant 9.25%.I have been a life long citizen of NC and have always been fond of this state. I am just retired and living on a fixed income. You have raised taxes on Senior Citizens and you have raised taxes in many other ways since you have been in office. You said you wouldn't raise taxes when you were running for office. What must the citizenry think of you, if you will not live up to your word. I live in Charlotte, NC, one of the most expensive places to live in the state. We pay a very high property tax rate along with many other high taxes for every give away program that can be designed by Man or Woman. I plan to move across the line to South Carolina as soon as possible. They have a propety tax that caps at $500 for Senior Citizens...something that NC does not have. I don't need to live in NC any longer. There are many other people leaving NC and it will continue. You talk about education all the time. If the school system would stop wasting money...they would have enough money to pay for out children's education without raising taxes in a depression time. We have not protected our borders and NC has not done anything to stop the infiltration of illegal aliens. I have not heard you say anything about this issue that is causing the shortage of money for education. I believe you want to give the illegals a free college educations...something our own children don't benefit from. Well, I have gone on long enough, but believe me the people of NC will remember this, come next election. Jim Hester Charlotte, NC

Mr. Hall,

We spoke via telephone on Tuesday, August 25, 2009 and during our conversation, you referred several times to having documentation proof to support the allegations you referenced during our discussion.

I asked for a copy of said documentation proof in order to substantiate the allegation made; I was informed at that time that you were meeting with your attorney in the afternoon and that you would seek his advice on whether you should release the documentation. After our discussion, I asked that you call me after you met with your attorney.


I placed a call to the contact number you provided, on Thursday August 27, 2009, I left a voicemail message stating that I was following-up on the conversation we had on August 25, 2009, and that I needed a status concerning the documentation.

If I am unable to substantiate the allegations, I have no choice but to close this case due to a lack of evidence.


Regards,

Winston Harrison

Re:                   Lowering of United States and North Carolina Flags on Patriot Day





Governor Perdue has ordered that all United States and North Carolina flags at state facilities be flown at half-staff on Friday, September 11, in recognition of Patriot Day, which President Obama has declared as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. Flags are to be lowered to half staff from the time that they are normally raised until the close of day, then returned to full staff on Saturday, September 12. 



All employees of the Department of Administration join Governor Perdue and me in honoring the innocent who lost their lives that day and the selfless efforts of those who continue to protect our freedom at home and abroad.

THE FINAL INSPECTION

The Army Soldier stood and faced God,

Which must always come to pass.

He hoped his shoes were shining,

Just as brightly as his brass.




'Step forward now, Soldier,

How shall I deal with you?

Have you always turned the other cheek?

To My Church have you been true?'

The soldier squared his shoulders and said,

'No, Lord, I guess I ain't.

Because those of us who carry guns,

Can't always be a saint.

I've had to work most Sundays,

And at times my talk was tough.

And sometimes I've been violent,

Because the world is awfully rough.




But, I never took a penny,

That wasn't mine to keep....

Though I worked a lot of overtime,

When the bills got just too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help,

Though at times I shook with fear.

And sometimes, God, forgive me,

I've wept unmanly tears.




I know I don't deserve a place,

Among the people here.

They never wanted me around,

Except to calm their fears.




If you've a place for me here, Lord,

It needn't be so grand.

I never expected or had too much,

But if you don't, I'll understand.




There was a silence all around the throne,

Where the saints had often trod.

As the Soldier waited quietly,

For the judgment of his God.




'Step forward now, you Soldier,

You've borne your burdens well.

Walk peacefully on Heaven's streets,

You've done your time in Hell.'

~Author Unknown~




If you care to offer the smallest token of

recognition and appreciation for the Military,

please  pray

for our men and women who have served

and are currently serving our country

and pray for those who have given

the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.

If hackers take over a nuclear plant's control system, should the president order the computer networks shut down?

An al-Qaeda's follower stuffed his bum with explosives and blew himself up next t the Saudi antiterror chief (the chief was only slightly injured); how serious is this new bum-bombers threat?

America , Canada  & all   Europe  ..... needs a President like this






    <aoladp://MA24763520-0001/ATT00000.jpg>

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd â€“  Australia






  Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks.

Separately, Howard angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques.
Quote: 'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians'.

'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom'. 'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!'

'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.'

'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.'

'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom,

'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.'

'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.'






  Maybe if we circulate this , American citizens will find the backbone to start speaking and voicing the same truths.

If you agree, please SEND THIS ON.

Olympia Snowe enjoys broad support in her home state, but she faces significant political problems if she opposes President Obama's health insurance reform. A Snowe vote against health insurance reform results in Mainers evenly divided on whether she should be re-elected, while support for Obama's plan produces 53 percent who want to re-elect Snowe compared to 38 percent who want someone new as U.S. Senator.

<http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102736777497&s=9093&e=001VZfeMcASa5KcZJyc0PCDu_sLsZ6CKmlKgW2nLb1Oaai_r7jNrdqgaHQ2vHIlqhNfu51XptzozgYtqar0CzioqQI9EnX0OJEXb4UFl2YMQNwlU12QlkrjXemrQCtX2PEV0DVpg005HsdclL3ujfhklLzW7-hZfnemGsJHuePZ3muoPwoNBY9E1OHetmqS_p11jP22nS25oN2GkBTKXonq-HpEUHbkpRBAR08TzXTwvPobX5jsGOSU4w==>Read more »

Mainers worry that Republicans are obstructing passage of health care reform and they want Senator Snowe to do what she thinks is right, rather than hold out for a more bipartisan bill:

* By 50 to 39 percent, voters in Maine believe Republicans in Congress “aren't being constructive and just want Obama to fail” rather than that they “are playing a constructive role in improving a health care reform bill.”

* By 62 to 29 percent, Mainers believe President Obama “has made an effort to reach out to Republicans on health care reform” rather than that he “has ignored Republicans' ideas on health care reform.”

* And by 64 to 28 percent, they feel Senator Snowe “should vote for the health care bill if she thinks it's a good bill even if she is the only Republican who supports it” rather than that she “should only vote for the health care bill if it is a bipartisan bill that other Republicans are willing to support.”

Finally, it is clear that Mainers overwhelmingly support a government sponsored non-profit health insurance option, 63 to 27 percent. And they support this option from the start significantly more strongly than they support a “trigger” (52 to 34 percent) that would create the government sponsored non-profit health insurance option only if private health insurance companies do not make affordable coverage available within several years.

Can our Federal Government do anything right? It is laughable that the federal govt has the nerve to even propose establishing a national healthcare system, they are broke and cannot even balance their own checkbook.

* The first Postal Service was established in 1775. After 234 years of trying to make it work, it is broke!
* In 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Social Security Administration, and after 74 years of trying to make it work, it is flat broke!
* In 1938, the Federal program known as Fannie Mae was established, and after 71 years of trying to make that work, it is broke.
* In 1964, the Federal Government launched a program called The War on Poverty.
* After 45 five years of transferring money to the poor, at a rate of 1 trillion dollars per year, the entire country is broke.
* In 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were established, and 44 years later, those programs are broke.
* In 1970, The Federal program known as Freddie Mac was established, and now, 39 years later it is also broke.
* In 2009, TARP money and the Omnibus Appropriations Act was set into motion, and after a matter of months, it has utterly failed.
* In 2009, the Federal Cash for Clunkers program was established and went broke faster than any other program ever established. It destroyed hundreds of thousands of good cars, burned up three billion dollars, and transferred the majority of that wealth to Korea and Japan.
Now, coming off from a 100% failure rate, they are planning to establish a national health care system!

a very good point.  I hope this makes
Its way around the USA   several times over!!!!! 
So Be It!  
>>>> THE LAW IS THE LAW  
>>>>  So ' if ' the US government determines that it is
Against the law for the words "In God We Trust"  
To be on our money, then, so be it.  
>>>>  And ' if ' that same government decides that the
'Ten Commandments' are not to be used in or on A
 government installation, then, so be it.  
I say, 'so be it,'   because I would like to be a
Law abiding US citizen.  
I say, 'so be it,'   because I would like to think that
Smarter people than I are in positions to make good
Decisions. I would like to think that those people have the
American public's best interests at heart.

BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'D LIKE?

Since we can't pray to God, can't Trust in God and
Cannot post His Commandments in Government
Buildings ,  I don't believe the Government and its
Employees should participate in the Easter and Christmas celebrations which honor the God that our government
Is eliminating from many facets of American life.  
I'd like my mail delivered on Christmas, Good Friday, 
Thanksgiving & Easter.  After all, it's just another day.  
I'd like the US Supreme Court to be in session on
Christmas, Good Friday, Thanksgiving & Easter as
Well as Sundays.'   After all, it's just another day.  

I'd like the Senate and the House of Representatives
To not have to worry about getting home for the 
'Christmas Break.'   After all it's just another day.  
I'm thinking that a lot of  my taxpayer dollars
Could be saved, if all government offices & services would
work on Christmas, Good Friday & Easter. 
It shouldn't cost any overtime since those would be
Just like any other  day of the week to a government
That is trying to be 'politically correct.'

                               In fact....
I think that our government should work on Sundays   (initially set aside for worshipping God...)   because, after all, our government says that it should
Be just another day....
What do you all think????
>>>>  
If this idea gets to enough people, maybe our elected
Officials will stop giving in to the 'minority opinions'
And begin, once again, to represent the 'majority'
Of ALL of the American people.
SO BE IT...........
>>>>  
Please Dear Lord,  
Give us the help needed to keep you in our country!
'Amen' and 'Amen'   
>>>>  
These are definitely things I never thought about but
from now on, I will be sure to question those in
Government who support these changes.   
>>>>  
At the top, it says  'I hope this makes its way around
The USA several times over!!!!!'
Let's see that it does

Dear Educators,

Over the last three weeks and today, Constantcontact.com has had technical issues which has prevented users editing corrections from being saved.  Although all material is reviewed before being sent out, the unedited emails are still being sent out in the very end.  This is not only embarrassing, it's unprofessional as well.  This can also discredit my company to anyone who has never dealt with Burgess Publishing and Media in the past.  I apologize for this inconvenience as I have been promised that this issue will be resolved as soon as possible.  I was assured that this email would be personally forwarded to my contacts by the Constantcontact.com IT department.  Thanks for your understanding.
