Subject: medicaid/welfare

Comment: Please help put and end to fertility treatments paid for by medicaid. A patient came in to our office for care, living on welfare, pregnant with twins as a result of fertility treatments, unmarried, and HIV positive. I'm tired of paying all these taxes and constantly paying for everyone's personal whims! I can't even get deductions for college but they get all their lives paid for! Maybe instead of supporting my unemployed adult children who just graduated from college and can't find jobs, I should sign them up for welfare! There is no accountablility and no incentive to get off of the government payroll!

Subject: NC Virtual Public School

Comment: Ms. Purdue and staff, I am a teacher and interested in teaching for the virtual high school. I do have one comment about this program though. I have not been able to verify this with factual information, but I have heard that the salary for online teaching at the virtual school is 450$ per student. This figures seems astronomical to me, and I am sure most teachers would work for half this price. It seems the money could be invested elsewhere, like in lower income school districts. I know teachers in the actual public schools are not getting paid nearly this amount, which is unfair. I do thank you for the hard work you are doing for the education system and for NC.

Subject: CMS

Comment: Congratulations on a great victory. God be with you and your family. I am writing you today about CMS, while we all face great challenges across this nation and around the world; more than ever we need to rain-in out of control management. Education is just the financial sector, out of control - Like everyone else CMS will take a hit, and as usual Peter Gorman will lay the burden on the schools, while he continues to build an empire downtown. Five years ago less than 50 people made over $100,000.00 in CMS, now we have over 100 and not one of them teaches! It isn't brain surgery, more quality teachers, smaller classrooms and a few more computers with some creativity would pay great off quickly (decentralize). Mr. Gorman is just a glorified PR man, he is not an educator. All the fluff he's added in CMS hasn't made a difference these past few years. Then there's the dysfunctional board led by the infamous "Coach" Joe, but that's another story for another time! Release the hounds! Good Luck!!! Robert C. Rosso

Subject: Teacher retirement

Comment: Gov. Perdue, I appreciate the opportunity to express my concerns with your office. I have been a dedicated teacher in the Randolph County School System for over 29 years. I read a disturbing article in the Courier Tribune that the legislature is considering mandatory retirement for teachers with 30+ years. As of July 1st I will be in that category. First of all, I love my work with middle school students and have even been involved in numerous summer school sessions and extra-curricular activities besides my regular duties. I have over 160 sick days, so you can see I am serious about my work. On a personal note, my son, who was just recently diagnosed with diabetes, is a college student who depends on my medical insurance. He is majoring in computer engineering at UNCC, and has received NO government assistance. He has some loans, and his dad and I are helping him as much as we can. I believe in hard work and taking reponsibility for my own child, so please don't take my livlihood from me. I understand you have been to Washington to seek more funds, and I applaud your efforts. Your assistance in helping maintain employment for people like me would be greatly appreciated! Sincerely, Karon H. Johnson

Exactly who will be making decisions for DOT about which plants to plant and which invasive plants to remove? In the past DOT has planted numerous Euonymus alata, Winged Burning Bush all along the Interstate highways around Raleigh and elsewhere. That plant is listed as invasive on <http://www.invasive/eastern.org>www.invasive/eastern.org and in my humble opinion should not have been planted in the first place even if it does make a pretty show in autumn.



Jobs could be created by hiring people to remove those invasive plants and others. Please consider an endowment to remove invasive plants, animals and pathogens. Could the conservation project be overseen by botany departments at several universities offering training and advice?

First Day of Change

Welcome to the email list for the Office of Governor Bev Perdue.  We hope that regular updates from the Office of the Governor will encourage you and the people of North Carolina to participate in our state government and will keep you better informed.



As the first order of business as Governor, <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/firstDayChange.aspx>Bev Perdue today signed a series of change orders that will help make government operate with more transparency and efficiency.  In a ceremony at her office, Governor Perdue signed five orders:

1. Governors Task Force for the Development of an Endowment for Positive Gubernatorial Campaigns
-       Starts the process of changing the way gubernatorial campaigns are run by creating a task force to develop the framework for an endowment that will provide third-party funding and remove special interest money from gubernatorial elections.

1. Reforming the Department of Transportation
-       Will prohibit DOT Board members from voting on individual projects and changes the way DOT does business  putting more of the decision-making in the hands of professionals.

1. Open Book Government for North Carolina
-       Increases accountability and transparency by creating a searchable and public website that shows spending on grants and contracts.

1. On-Site and State-Stat Performance Management and Accountability
-       Governor Perdue will make regular, unannounced inspections of state facilities and will require departments to conduct statistical performance reviews of government programs.

1. Establishing the North Carolina Budget Reform and Accountability Commission (BRAC)
-       Citizen oversight panel will ensure government programs are using tax dollars in the most effective and efficient way possible.



Additionally, Governor Perdue affirmed her commitment to participating in at least four live town halls.  She also officially launched an electric-town hall (<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/eTownhall/>eTownhall) to be maintained on her website in an effort to remain engaged with, and receive constructive feedback from, the public.

Subject: NC Wildlife Resources Commission proposed hunting changes



The Honorable Governor of NC, Bev Perdue;

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission has proposed very significant and almost certainly damaging changes to the hunting season. The vast majority of the hunters in NC are opposed to these hunting regulation changes proposed by the NCWRC. I attended a hearing in Morganton, NC and the auditorium was packed. Many, many hunters spoke out against the proposed extended gun season. David Cobb, Division Chief, was reported to have stated recently at another hearing that over 13,000 comments have been made which is more than he has ever seen in his time with the Commission. He further stated that his perception is that there is a majority of people who are in opposition. This opposition is occurring all over the state.


Dr. Craig A. Harper, who is a professor in the Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries Department at the University of Tennessee, spoke at the Morganton hearing in opposition. Dr. Harper is nationally recognized in quality deer management and has published many papers on such. Dr. Harper stated that there is no biological reason to try to establish one common deer season across the diverse state of NC. In fact there are many valid reasons to not have a common season statewide. I have attached a copy of an open letter from Dr. Harper on this issue. The deer population, weather, people, food sources, growing season, etc in the mountains, the piedmont and coastal plains are all considerably different. One size does not fit all and makes no biological sense. The Commission's deer density map on their own website supports our claim.  The same is true for the Commission's turkey season proposed changes. It is so glaringly apparent that these proposed changes are so ! seriously flawed that virtually everyone at these hearing, including the NCWRC biologist staff, understand it.


In the July, 2006 minutes of the Deer Committee meeting of the NCWRC, the minutes state that "In fact, discussion during the Deer Committee revealed that there is more support for decreasing the length of the all-lawful-weapons season in the Central Deer Season area" instead of these proposed increases in the season. In a later meeting of the Deer Committee in April, 2007 a hunter survey by the NCWRC with 5,005 hunter responses was presented to the committee. In these meeting minutes the "Committee felt that it would not be prudent to increase the length of the all-lawful-weapons season in any season area..."  And "Comments were made as to why this issue is being revisited again, and concerns were raised that our staff were being asked to evaluate and possibly propose a regulation proposal for which there is little to no support for at the field level." We are at a loss to understand why the Commissioners are trying to shove these changes th! rough when no staff biologists support it. Where are the studies and surveys that support their positions? Yet the NCWRC is still proposing to make these hunting regulation changes.  The Commission is not listening to the proven science of wildlife biology from their own biologists, outside biologists nor to the hunters of North Carolina. If the Commissioners ignore the science of wildlife biology our wildlife and hunting will suffer greatly.


There are many other significant detriments of this extended deer gun season if passed, such as bear hunters (who primarily use dogs) and deer hunters being in the woods at the same time and bird hunters effectively getting reduced hunting. The bear/deer issue in particular will create conflicts and animosity again as it did years ago when the seasons overlapped.


This is a very serious issue and will damage the fragile deer and turkey population in the central and western parts of our state where some hunters have just started quality deer management practices to improve the numbers and quality of deer. We don't have hunters from other states traveling to NC to hunt deer like the Midwest and other states. Why? Because our deer herds are not in good shape and don't produce many big, mature bucks.


The majority of NC hunters oppose this seriously flawed proposal. If the Wildlife Commission wants to promote wildlife in NC then they should propose changes to encourage and promote quality wildlife management programs that work. I hope you will join us in opposing these damaging hunting regulation proposals and will work to see they are NOT passed by the NCWRC.


Respectfully,

Brian Heath

Good Morning,



On January 11, I filed a new benefit claim, because I was let go from my position because it wasn't working out.



I filed my weekly certification the next week and the week after that. On Wednesday I was on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak to someone as to why I have not received any payment yet. I was left on hold past closing time, I didn't receive a message or anything stating that the office was closed and to call back the next day, it just left me hanging.



I called Thursday morning and was on hold for 75 minutes, when I finally did get a person I was told that I hadn't received any money because they need a statement from me about being let go, WHY didn't someone called or send me a letter?



Second I have collected unemployment in Texas and Pennsylvania both and it is always up too the previous employer as to whether or not you can collect. Why is it up to the state here? Also I realize that the offices are very busy but people can not go for 8 to 10 weeks to receive money. I have children and I need my unemployment money to pay rent and utilities.



Sincerely,

Monica Muras

Gov. Perdue,



There are at least 38 state that reimburse Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNA) for the anesthesia services they provide.  BCBS of NC refuses to reimburse CRNA's and continues to drive up the cost of health care.  I attached a link to one of the many states that acknowledges us for what we are, professionals.

Subject: Banks Road Elementary School - traffic light/truning lane "roadblock"

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue: Congratulations on your new position. I am excited and hopeful for the future of my childrens education. The reason for my letter is simple,a turning lane that was planned for 401 & Banks Road (Banks Road Elementary school) has hit some delays. In July 2008, Banks Road Elementary School will officially be open in a year round operation. Almost 500 children of the student population live south of Banks Road on the east and west side of 401. At this time there is NO traffic light and NO turning lane on 401N, which would allow buses and cars to turn safely onto Banks Road. Below are the numbered responses to my inquiries, from Jeff Young, a project manager. I believe my questions are evident in his responses. 1) It is my understanding that NCDOT plans to install traffic lights at Banks Road and Highway 401. Due to the recent economic climate and impact on State budgets, I am not clear on how this impacts the timetable. 2) Yes, a turning lane was designed for the northbound lane of Hwy 401 for deceleration to turn onto Banks Road. This project has begun, but has hit a 'roadblock' due to an old existing water main along Hwy 401 that is part of the Fuquay Varina Municipal Water Service. This water line is to be replaced per a recent meeting with NCDOT, WCPSS and Town of Fuquay Varina. Unfortunately, it appears that WCPSS is to be held responsible for the design and construction of the new section of water line, since the road improvement is what dictates the replacement. Currently, the Off-Site Improvements component of the CIP 2006 Building Program is depleted. It is my understanding that this budget line item will not receive additional funding until around May 2009. 3) Yes, safe access to the new schools is always a design consideration. This includes bus transportation. I hope you find these answers satisfactory. Sincerely, Jeff K. Young, Project Manager Facilities Design & Construction 1429 Rock Quarry Road, Suite 116 Raleigh, NC 27610 Email: jkyoung@wcpss.net Office: (919) 856-8291 Fax: (919) 856-8172 Nextel: (919) 422-1865 By reading his responses, this problem will not be resolved until MAY 2009  14 months after the school OPENS! Could you get the the necessary funds to complete this project before our school opens in July 2008? Regards, Maureen Felman 4608 Spring Crest Court Fuquay Varina, NC 27526 919 557 9450

Subject: public schools

Comment: Bev, There was a time when I could just reach across the committee table and share my ideas with you. Well, times have changed so I'll try this approach. I'm so frustrated with the direction we are going in our public schools. It's all about the TESTS. I remember talking about how education should be run more like a business. I guess that is just what we are doing. It's all about the scores. We now have two faculties- those teachers who teach EOC courses and those that don't teach EOC courses. Looks like we would at least place these great national certified teachers into the all important EOC courses especially since they are much better trained (better than our own UNC system is providing). I reckon since I was at one time on the top as the House Appropriations Chair and have now been returned to the bottom rung - the classroom teacher- it just appears we may be heading in the wrong direction in some areas. I would like to talk with someone in your administration and share my perspective. Perhaps the staff member who reads this - will relay it onto your desk. And by the way, you remember that great trip our Honors Civics classes from East Surry used to take and you would treat us like royalty- well, we can't take those anymore - we just can't take time to learn the real world - see it isn't tested in those multiple choice questions on the EOC.

Subject: The possible closing of Torchlight Academy in Raleigh,NC

Comment: Dear Governor: I am writing to you to express my concern over the possible closing of a community charter school, Torchlight Academy grades K-5, meets the need of children and families who have more difficulty with traditional school settings. This school is meeting a great need in the African American Community for parents and families considered at-risk. My organization,The Institute of Behavior Management-IBHM, began working with Torchlight about 9mos ago in the area of mental health develooment. We have seen gradual improvements in test scores and the behaviors of the children who have been referred directly to IBHM from Torchlight. We would like the opportunity to continue our work because we feel confident we can continue to make a difference in test scores and in confidence levels. Please take time to review the contributions made by this organizateion and consider the help and support we can provide to them as African-American educators and mental health professionals. We supported you for governor because we felt confident that you would make more than a cursory effort to help our struggling charter schools. If you have the time, please contact me at 919-899-6740, or Dr. Cynthia McQueen directly at Torchlight Academy at 919-697-6398. Thank you for your consideration of this very important matter in advance. Yours in Support and Service, Dr. Phyllis Wright-West,PhD

Subject: Education cuts

Comment: I voted for you, Governor Purdue, in part because of your promise of a free education for all. I am an adult student at Durham Technical Community College in the Web Technologies program. I was dismayed to find out tonight that higher education budgets have been cut once again. Durham Tech is now cutting back on summer classes to make up for these cuts. As a student, I feel it is my obligation to let you know that my education is of the utmost importance to me, and to my classmates, especially in this economy. Education is how many people will get out of their dire financial straights, and cutting funding for programs that should help bring us OUT of a recession does not make sense. I know that balancing the budget is very important and that cuts are difficult no matter where they come from, but please consider the students in your state, and how you may best serve us as we are working to become better citizens. Thank you for your time. Sonja Foust

Comment: I have tried to contact the ESC using three e-mail addresses from the ESC online services. The e-mails keep coming back to me as undeliverable. I have been signed up for benefits and have served my one week waiting period. I have still have not received my benefits. We are the highest tax state in the southeast you think we would not have these kind of problems. Is this the kind of services we can expect from your administration. I have tried this phone number from the Charlotte Observer (866)278-3822. It is used to check on claim statis. When I call it the message tell me to call later. Is this the kind of servive I can expect from the state of North Carolina.

Subject: National Guard

Comment: My husband is a member of the NC National Guard and is deployed. My husband volunteered with the 30BCT. Due to the volunteer status he should have received $50.00 more per muta in Oct and Nov 2008. IG and his chain of command are telling him that he was on a derivitaive UIC due to not having a family care plan. We have since found that they were mistaken as we told them all along and that he was not on the derivative UIC. To this date we have not received the extra $50.00 per muta for Oct and Nov 2008 nor have we received the mileage for him traveling to and from RedSprings in Nov 2008 for drill. When he asks the chain of command in his unit, he is told that they do not have time to deal with it and that he can call IG but they will not do anything about it either. This is very frustrating for us. My husband has served his country for 16 years and to be treated like this is a slap in the face. He is about to go on Federal orders on Feb. 11, 2009. He is in Mississippi now and wanted me to let you know also that the food that he is paying for is worse than what we feed our prisoners in NC. They are withdrawing money from his paycheck because they are paying him for food and then taking it back. I don't understand how our state can be so unprofessional especially when it comes to our armed forces. My husband and his fellow soldiers and their families are going through a rough transition that will only get worse and to have to deal with pay issues at the same time and for noone to care is heartbreaking and very stressful. Please feel free to contact me and I can better explain what is going on. I would appreciate anything that you can do to help.

We have teachers there that cuss at our students, threatening to hit students, call are students names such as gay and tell them that if there parents would die they would be on the streets. Teacher that will not follow an IEP or help a parent with the student if you ask for help. I have been in WV schools and now here in NC and this is the worst school I have ever seen. You can not speak you mind to teacher or principals or board or they make it worse on your child. I care about my kids education I care if they make it in the world or not.

What are you going to do to help MY kids with there educations I am a voter and I feel that no one listen to these kids they need a voice or they will be left behind again. I pay taxes and play the lottery and yet we have no paper at the schools that makes no sense to me.

Subject: Tax Audit

Comment: Thankyou for the audit on my 2006 state taxes, should I not have been honest and declared myself a Rebublican on my tax form? I'm being audited over charitable contributions, which in some way has to do with line 20a, which is 2006 estimated tax, which I indeed left blank. Instructions clearly state line 20a is for, 2006 estimated tax - "Enter any estimated income tax payments for 2006 (including any portion of your 2005 refund that was applied to your 2006 estimated income tax) See page 6 for additional information about estimated income tax. Nothing on page 6 applies either. None was applied and therefore this line was left blank! NC says I have 45 days to reply with data to back up my tax form, and why I left line 20A blank. Line 20a was left blank, because it did not apply to me. As far as charities I have 6 kids and I routinely drop off outgrown clothes shoes, and such. They ask at Goodwill if I want a reciept but I always say no because I work at night and just want to go home. Now you want proof that I had my state tax reduced legaly. So you are calling me a criminal basicaly. I have never been arrested, but if you want you can arrest me, put me in prison, then you can feed, house and clothe my 6 children and wife til whenever!

Subject: Free tuition for community college for all NC HS graduates

Comment: This question concerns the future of the Governor's campaign proposal to provide free tuition to a NC community college for all graduates of a NC high school. Since the Governor has backed off from this plan for the time being, what is the status of it's being implemented in the future? If it is still on her educational policy agenda,what is the time table for introducing legislation. Details available from the campaign website were limited about the plans for actually implementing this policy. If there are more details available, how might I obtain access to them? Aside from the current economic and fiscal crisis, what are the major obstacles to implementing this policy. Thanks, John Duncan

It has come to my attention that we are spending an excessive amount of
money dressing our crossing guards. I believe it is the amount of $800.00 in
uniforms so they can look much like a police officer while they are
assisting our children across the streets to school. I believe this is
ridiculous. Please put a stop to this spending.

Governor Perdue,
I had emailed the former governor voicing my concern about the bill he
passed in regards to allowing illegal immigrants to attend our community
colleges and was told he would not slam the door in their faces. I am not
sure what he did not understand about illegal. I am an American citizen, a
Navy vet, and attend college in the evening. Will you be able to reevaluate
this bill to stop catering to these illegals? If they want to attend our
schools, they should go through the legal channels and not be given any
concessions.

Also I am attaching a story about Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona and am
hoping our state can take some of his ideas and help our state with all of
the criminals and the millions of dollars we spend on them.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Corena Crouch

To: the Office of the Governor, Raleigh

Thanks for making the Governor's office so accessible. That is, in itself, exciting and refreshing !!

I look forward to receiving your newsletter.

In terms of active State-wide participation - leveraging talent & skills within our borders - I thought I'd share that I am a Cary-based consultant in IT & Technology strategy, and have a strong interest in providing strategic input on some of the broad reforms that have been mandated by your Office.

Specifically, my consulting work is focused on strategic change in the IT space, including reduction of inefficient operations, effective solution sourcing (including outsourcing), and optimizing management of internal competencies. On the surface, it seems there could be some synergies -  

But I don't know the degree to whi! ch IT Management Reform is on radar for the State in the near term.

I've read EO3 carefully, and it would seem both the Governor's Policy Office and the OSBM would have energy on setting meaningful parameters and goals in the context of Section 1, Strategic Planning.  But from there, it is unclear to me how I might engage the right stakeholders.

Can you advise as to whom I might contact?

I will be attending the CED Biotech Conference in two weeks, and am also an active member of NCTA.  Perhaps there would be opportunities for me to compare notes with the right folks in one of these venues?

In any case, I look forward to your success with the major challenges ahead.  You certainly have my full support.

Good Afternoon,

 I am not sure whether this is something your office traditionally would help with or not, but it is absolutely frustrating and sometimes seems nearly impossible to try to find out where to go for help on this level. I cannot tell you how much we would appreciate your assistance and guidance!

 We are a training, consulting and development company that works with childcare centers and early childhood education schools across NC. We are a local small business, serving our community through facilitating quality in our field. The reason I am contacting you is, we can and need to create several jobs this year and consistently over the next few years:

* Manufacturing: furniture and other equipment for childcare centers & schools, well-made yet less expensive so programs are not having to make choices between buying equipment for their children and paying the teachers; the plans and designs are completed and ready for production.

* Sales and Service Reps: We intend on opening 2 resource locations serving childcare/early childhood/elementary supplies and equipment. Local and convenient to lower shipping costs.

* Training: The bulk of our program is the training aspect we provide for our field. We provide everything from Adult, Child & Infant CPR to Behavior Guidance to Curriculum Implementation to raising Quality by preparing for the Environmental Rating Scales and raising their star rated license, etc. We help centers understand Child Development, NC DCD and Health & Sanitation Regulations, The Environmental Rating Scales, NAEYC Accreditation, Leadership, Professionalism, and so much more. We were founded 5 years ago to be an agent for the programs themselves, to help them be successful in every aspect. So far, without any funding, capital, investors, or additional sources of revenue, we help over 200 programs here in NC every year. But we would like to help the 6,000+ childcare centers, schools, and home providers that need our help year-round. We truly provide outstanding and proven programs, but do not have the funding to do all that we reall! y could be. We need several more professionals, and want to open 2 training centers on each side of NC this year and expand each year thereafter.

TEACHING JOBS: We train and recruit teachers and individuals who are looking for jobs in the NC Early Childhood Field, provide them with the training, skills, certifications and documentation needed to find a job in the field and match them with employers that are desperately seeking qualified and professional people to hire ASAP! The program, affectionately called Orientation Bootcamp is a very popular and needed program. Every day we get calls from new providers looking for teachers, but we cannot fund this program. Funding would allow us not only to create jobs within our own company, but we can help so many people who are suddenly having to look for work and so many centers who are in dire need of good people.

 What we are boldly asking for is at least $1 million... I know the budget is tight, I know everyone is trying to cut everywhere. But this is a good investment in NC, on so many levels. We would be able to institute these things immediately because they are all completed projects that are just waiting for the funding to implement. This is an investment that would yield immediate results. We would really love to formally discuss any options available ASAP. Without the funding, we are stuck provide quality assistance, but too small of a percentage of what we could be doing. With funding, we can hire immediately, and create lasting and continually growing programs and services.

Thank you so much for your help and we look forward to talking to you soon!

Thank you!

Dear Governor Perdue -



Attached is letter from the Randolph County Senior Adults Association, Inc. (RCSAA) describing our progress toward the construction of a new environment-friendly multi-purpose Senior Activities Center for Randolph County. Our schematic building design will be completed soon as well as our feasibility study. With additional funds, the engineering design phase can be completed in 3 - 6 months and RCSAA can begin the ground work to prepare the site for construction. Our funding requests are in the process of being prepared for submission and I am hopeful that we will be successful in securing funding for our new facility. This new facility will play a critical role in the future of RCSAA as it is not only being designed to expand services, it will also generate up to four new jobs, as well as provide a new source of revenue for RCSAA.



Please contact me if you have questions or concerns regarding this request. I am happy to meet with you one-on-one to show you our design plans and to answer any questions you may have.



Thank you -

Subject: CAP and the Rule of "242"

Comment: Dear Governor Perdue, My wife and I write on behalf of our son, Markus A. Lubans. As a 21 year old adult recipient of the Community Alternative Program (CAP) benefits in Durham County, he is caught in a bureaucratic dilemma. We are hoping that with the new legislative year and a new state administration, you may be able to do what is right for Markus and other adults with special needs caught in a similar circumstance. Early last year Markus moved out on his own, with a roommate, into a townhouse administered by the Durham County Community Living Program (DCCLP). This is a wonderful opportunity for Markus to develop and practice independent living skills and to be all he can be as a contributing member of our society. Impeding his progress is something called a CAP/ NC Medicaid mandated spend down. It is also known in Medicaid circles as the deductible and as the notorious, 242. This latter number refers to the outdated financial base used in calculating Markus income. The 242 has not been adjusted for inflation and the cost of living since the early 1990s! As you may know, when someone like Markus receives his monthly Social Security check for $1017.00 he has to return to NC Medicaid over $750 dollars (each month) for the spend down. This leaves him with around $300.00 for rent he owes to DCCLP ($305.00) and nothing for food, clothing and transportation. On top of this is the NC Medicaid mandate that any money he earns through employment is added dollar for dollar to the spend down. So, if he earns $30.00 from his part time work at Duke School Library, he needs to hand it over to Medicaid. We have consulted with several Durham County officials, including Mr. Sammy Haithcock, the head of Durham Social Services, and attorneys about the logic, fairness and practicality of this sort of enforced poverty. They all tell us that, while unfair  even stupid, as one official terms it - it is the rule and DSS cannot deviate from it. We have sought a waiver for the spend down. This waiver is available to some Social Security recipients who receive CAP services. Again, a technicality: Because Markus gets SSA and has never received SSI, he is not qualified for the waiver, even if his circumstances are now identical to those people with the waiver! We are told that some waiver recipients, currently receiving SSA, qualify for the waiver because at some point in their lives they received SSI, even if for only a month! Here is what we think is fair: The Rule of 242 needs to be adjusted for all in its scope so that Markus can afford his rent, food and clothing which he could afford with his own Social Security benefit if it were left whole. And, any money Markus earns through work should be taxed at a normal rate, just like the rest of us. Some people tells us Solve this mess, give up CAP. Well, we are very grateful recipients of the CAP services Markus receives  they are essential to his living as a positive citizen. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail. Please let us know if there are other people we should contact to help Markus.

Subject: Do Not Close Wright School

Comment: We are the parents of a graduate of Wright School and are writing to ask you to not close Wright School. We do not know what we would have done without Wright School. It was the most difficult decision we had ever made on our son's behalf, but it has brought the most profound change in him and in our family as a result. His time at Wright school has created a life that we did not consider possible for him and our family. The model of re-education works. Their goals of significant increases in academic skills, personal strengths, prosocial behaviors and significant decreases in problem behaviors in their graduates are met and documented. For the past 3 years, Wright School has been collaborating with researchers at Duke University to assess the program's effectiveness. In this time of increasing concern about effective ways to treat the state's most difficult-to-treat children with mental health problems, this research was undertaken to examine the extent to which Wright School's approach - a model called Re-Education - was working. After analyzing data on 98 children who completed the program at Wright School, researchers concluded that Wright School is an effective program for serving the state's most difficult-to-treat 6 to 12 year olds. Children show enormous gains during treatment and maintain much of this gain for at least 6 months after discharge. The program appears to benefit a wide range of youth and to be effective with youth regardless of race, sex, or psychiatric diagnosis. Is it cost-effective to let these children go untreated and unsupported and generate larger costs to the DHHS in the future? How much does it cost to NOT have Wright School? You have a community of people, voters who elected you, who are willing to stand behind you and support you in thinking outside the box. We all have the same ultimate goals, a quality education for every student, students successfully transitioning back into their communities. Please consider the consequences for the community before you make your final decision. Please do the right thing; these are kids with severe emotional and behavioral issues, some experiencing unthinkable social challenges. They have no where else to go. No help. Their needs are beyond the school systems and beyond community mental health supports. This is a population who have absolutely no voice, no political voice. We are their voice and are asking you to please hear us. Wright School should not be closed but should be allowed to grow. This is a program that works and needs to be replicated. We do not know the criteria used to consider budget cuts, but strongly urge you to please consider the consequences for students, families and communities who will be impacted now and in the future by such a closure. We are asking you to please be more forward-thinking and consider the long-term effects of such a school closure, rather than just focusing on the short-term bottom line. Dr. Mark & Gwenda Raupp Hillsborough, NC

Comment: As a parent with a child attending a public school in Cumberland County, I am misguided by the appointment of Mr. Tim Kinlaw to serve as Interim Superintendent. While researching his current position as Associate Superintendent of Auxiliary Services, I noticed that the primary duties of the Assistant Superintendent for Auxiliary services supervises the support areas of Transportation, Nutrition Services, Warehouse, Maintenance, Operations, Facilities and Safety Departments. This position is responsible for managing all support areas of the school district to include all insurance and risk related programs. How can Mr. Kinlaw serve in such an important role in the lives of our childrens when his current role doesn't specify any connection with educational services in curriculum. I know that their are quite a few qualified personnel at the Board of Education in Cumberland County with higher level degrees in curriculum and instruction that could have well served in this position. I have quite a few parents that are not pleased with the decision that Governor Purdue made. Can she explain to the parents in Cumberland County what where her reasons for making such an appointment? Respectfully, A Concerned Parent

Subject: budget cuts

Comment: I am a teacher who is very concerned about education budget cuts. I am most concerned about the cuts of classroom teachers and assistants who are so very valuable to the education of students. Would it not be better to temporarily shorten the 180 student days and keep employees who are so effective in teaching the students. I realize this would be an undertaking in the legislative branches but 170 days of quality is better than increasing class sizes. Many questions would need to be addressed about teachers salaries, etc. If we are to have our step frozen it could be a way to compensate NC teachers who are lowest paid in the nation. It is really a question of quantity or quality. Sincerely, Patricia Blackwell

Howard 5020 Sardis Road Unit N Charlotte, NC 28270 Ms. Thelma Hill Senior Deputy Commissioner NC Employment Security Commission Raleigh,NC RE: 243-04-5239 Dear Deputy Commissioner Hill: Over the last few weeks I have sent a total of 5 emails and made numerous attempts to contact someone via telephone. I have yet to receive a response to the emails and the telephone circuits remain busy prohibiting me from contacting anyone by phone. My initial claim was filed in November of 2008. At that time my total eligible benefits shown were $3,762.00. To date I have received $3,420.00 leaving a balance of $342.00. I would like to inquire about any emergency extension programs I may be eligible for. I was hoping to resolve this matter before my current benefits are exhausted. I am actively seeking work and continue to use all available resources to network and apply for open positions. Without the benefit of additional unemployment compensation I will surely lose my home and automobile as I have depleted my savings. Any information you could provide on extension services or emergency relief (H.R. 5749) would be appreciated. I understand your staff is extremely busy and these are difficult times for all involved.

Subject: Tricare coverage for NC National Guardsman injured on active duty

Comment: Greetings, My name is Jessica Aguilar, my husband is a member of the NC National Guard prepareing to deploy in March for combat in OIF. We are very proud of his service for our country and the support he provides for our family. He was injured while training in GA in Dec. and has been undergoing physical therapy in MS with his unit. He has made adiquate improvement such that comand said they will green-light him if he returns home and completes the recomended 6 remaining weeks of therapy. He was originally slated to be enroled in the Wounded Warrors program at Ft.Bragg but comand opted to send him home to Hillsborough for whatever reason. I have been talking to a fantastic therapist who, given the details and documentation of his situation, has said that she sees no problem in full recovery in the time-frame required given his progress through the therapy provided in Mississippi. Everyone (comand, therapist in Miss. and here) seems to be in agreement that he is fully deployable as planned, however, comand is now saying that they are not going to put in a recomendation for Tricare coverage for the remaining portion of the physical therapy required. Tricare is our family's only source of insurance. There is no dispute that this is an active duty injury, nor is there a question of his ability to deploy provided that he conplete the required therapy, additionally he is still on active duty orders once he is here for the number of weeks needed for recovery (all paperwork is in order and has been signed by comand) the only thing lacking is the support for payment to the therapist (Select Care in Durham). Can you suggest any aid for us in this situation? I do not understand why Tricare would not be requested for an active duty injury. My husband is not the only one from his unit in this situation, there is another SPC who fell off a Bradly during an active duty training exersize and his therapy is also not being covered but he may deploy provided he complete his treatments which will not be covered by Tricare. They are both traveling home today from Mississippi. Could this be an oversite in paperwork on a company level? Please advise. Thank you for you time and attention to this matter. Please contact me if at all possible it would be a pleaseure to speak with you again (you were present at an event hosted by the Native American Student Association when I was at NC State, you managed to make time to speak breifly with each of us, that ment a lot, thank you) Respectfully, Jessica Aguilar

Comment: I am curious in a time when there are drastic budget cuts and the need for many jobs in NC, why last week there were new positions created in the education department, such as CEOs and other positions that would prompt the State Superintendent to ask for clarification as to what her roles are in that position. It seems to counteract what Governor Perdue is asking ECU and other universities and agencies to do in the state to cut out middle management, and it also seems to show a lack of confidence in the existing public school structures, positions, and individuals serving in those positions. I work for the state right now, and despite what I am seeing reflected in the newspapers, I am being told at work that our positions are in jeopardy and I know that my job is ending in May through no fault of my own. Where did the money come from to pay for these positions?

Governor Perdue,



Congratulations on your victory Bev! I recognize that there is plenty on your plate!



I hope you can change one thing with a proclamation by Executive Order that would affect everyone with a car. Yes..it's our blah passenger issue license plates.



Representatives Margaret Dickson, Lucy Allen and Becky Carney have sponsored 3 bills encouraging a "North Carolina License Plate Design Contest" with little success in 2003, 2005 and 2007 Legislative sessions. 



This bill for the 2007-2008 Session was H889. The bill passed with a huge majority vote in the NC House and never came up for a vote in the Senate.



<http://www.statesurge.com/bills/377090-h889-north-carolina>http://www.statesurge.com/bills/377090-h889-north-carolina

See the bill via link above and 25 Co-Sponsors.


Our state has so much to gain with a newly designed NC License Plate, and frankly nothing to lose!

It's smart to use the license plate for "marketing" our state, when NC vehicles are out of state. A new plate would make people feel proud to adorn their vehicles with an attractive license tag. Note the popularity of the Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation plate - #1 in success. If that plate was less than half as attractive as it is, the demand would not be so strong. After all, who wants to attach an ugly license tag to their vehicle?

Make no mistake about those concerned that The First in Flight background will go away...not for thousands and thousands of SPECIAL ISSUES, that use them. 



Why even Orville and Wilbur Wright would be tired of this plate today.

IT IS THE LONGEST STANDARD ISSUE PLATE IN EXISTENCE SINCE 1982 !!
That's longer than any other state in the country - 27 years!!!!

As an observer of other states std. issue plates and life-long license tag collector, the recent addition of the RED lettered alpha-numeric characters to the NC LICENSE TAGS hand it top honors for " Most Unattractive State License Plate in the Nation." The Red inked embossed characters don't even match the backdrop RED! That decision, to go RED, was made by the DMV and not the NC Legislature.

PLEASE ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ENCOURAGE A STANDARD ISSUE LICENSE PLATE DESIGN CONTEST, WITH SUBMISSIONS TO YOUR OFFICE WEB SITE. POST THE CONTEST ON THE WEB SITE.  It should be required that all designs submitted be imprinted with the state tourism web site on the top or bottom. Design contest should be limited to 3 or 4 individuals spot colors on a white background. NC DMV Director or DMV Safety Director would need to approve the finalists for visibility and plate shop printing capabilities. Post the top 6 designs on your site and allow the vote to happen on your web site by the public via online voting.


We (the silent majority of registered motor vehicle owners) are counting on you!

Subject: NC needs more modern roundabouts for safer intersections.



Governor Perdue,

Modern roundabouts MUST be considered to be a Key ingredient in regards to macro-level infrastucture planning. Roundabouts (not the ones in England, but the ones in Colorado, Maryland, Wisconsin etc) are cost effective, progressive, and 70-90% safer than any conventional box or multi-leg intersection. They are necessary to improve current air quality, by providing constant vehicular fluidity. They are environmentally friendly, with less storm water runoff vs an ocean of asphalt for conventional intersections. Cities and counties will actually save money, retrofitting intersections to roundabouts, since the traffic lights are removed.

They MUST be designed and installed at a more rapid pace over the next few years years.
Many states (WA, OR, UT, CO, AZ, MO, WI, MN, MI, MD, NY) that had less roundabouts than NC 10 years ago are far ahead of
Winston-Salem and North Carolina, with roundabout installations.

NC has got to start installing more roundabouts, in order to avoid spending millions on mega-bridges over US highways!!! Let's make our intersections smarter with roundabouts, NOT add lanes and make them fatter!!!

Additionally, funding needs to be sufficient for roundabouts - about $160,000 - $250,000 for a single-lane modern roundabout that flows 20,000 - 23,000 vehicles per day.

The 3 sites linked below comprise the "Dream Team" of roundabout designers in the US. Roundabouts need to be designed these engineers vs inetrnally at DOT. NC needs to get the designs right, so when they are installed, they are 100% accurate. DOT does not have the experience that this group of accomplished roundabout engineers has. If anything, perhaps a peer review of NC engineers by a member of the "Dream Team."

The DOT must be investing more in roundabouts, as other much more progressive states have. Roundabouts need to be front and center at NCDOT. They also need to be explained with images etc on the DMV Driver's Handbook site and the DOT Dept of Hwys site.

Sites to view consisting of the roundabout
"Dream Teams."

Subject: Highway Project (Yancey County)

Comment: Feb. 04, 2009 TO: Bev Perdue, Joe Sam Queen, Heath Shuler, Kay Hagan, & Richard Burr I am writing this letter in concern to the new highway being constructed in Burnsville, North Carolina (Yancey County). I am a renter of business property in this area and I am trying to find out some answer to the questions I have. The local departments have been unable to help me with these items of concern. I have been on this rental property for 13 years and have established 3 small businesses; they consist of a drive through dairy bar, a tool store, and a used car lot. On this same property there was also another business not affiliated with us (Jim Hughes & Assoc. Land Surveying Office). When the state of North Carolina came through surveying the property for the new highway the representative contacted the Yancey County Health department and the property owner. They discovered the tail lines of the septic system were located on the state right of way. These lines would have to be relocated. The health department evaluated the lot and discovered there was not enough land to relocate septic system. This is when they informed everyone that the septic system would be condemned when the highway was built. The state representative talked to me (Richard Buchanan) at this time he informed me that the state would be taking the Tool Store, Car Lot and the Dairy Bar. The buildings were measured and I was told that I would have to relocate all three businesses (Tool Store, Car Lot & Dairy Bar). Jim Hughes & Assoc. was also told they would have to relocate there surveying office. Mr. Bowlin the state representative settled with the property owner and the owner of the survey office which was relocated. I was then told that my businesses (Tool Store, Car Lot and the Dairy Bar) would be fine and I did not need to relocate. They informed me that one of the existing driveways that are used for my businesses would be eliminated. I ask which business I would loose due to this the Car Lot or Dairy Bar, at this time he told me to park the cars somewhere else. I asked the property owner if anything changed with the septic system. He said he was told to come in late one evening or on the weekend and put another septic system n without the knowledge of the health department. (This is hear say). This creates the problem I dont understand. I am concerned that when the road comes through I will be shut down due to the fact the septic system is condemned or some other reason. I am already losing the drive through for the dairy bar and the car lot. I also dont understand how one business is paid to relocate and the others are fine even though we all used the same septic system. I feel like my rights have been violated. I would appreciate your response to this manner.

Email: klundarmy@yahoo.com

Subject: Ramsey Street Alternative High School, Cumberland County

Comment: Please pass this forward to all those who care To all that this may concern, Ramsey Street Alternative High School, A Positive Alternative; I have been trying to understand what this phrase means and how it is translated within the school. So far, I have been unsuccessful. Ramsey Street Alternative High School is supposed to be an alternative for those students who could not function in a normal school setting. Our MISSION is to provide at-risk students with opportunities to acquire academic and behavioral skills that will lead to a successful return to their regular schools and reach the goal of high school graduation. In this statement listed on the schools website, http://www.rshs.ccs.k12.nc.us/, the key point here is behavioral skills; I have worked at the school since the beginning of the 2008-2009 school year and have yet to see any evidence of the students acquiring behavioral skills that will lead them back to their home schools. I was under the assumption that this school offered some sort of rehabilitation to the students, otherwise how would the student gain the skills necessary to return to their home schools. I thought that perhaps the students would be offered classes in such things as anger management or maybe social skill building, but instead they are offered classes like career management; what exactly does that mean to a Ramsey student? The VISION at Ramsey Street High School is to foster a safe and positive learning environment which recognizes the importance of varying abilities, learning styles, diverse cultures, parental involvement and the importance of increasing student achievement. http://www.rshs.ccs.k12.nc.us/ The students upon entering school, walk through a metal detector, pull out their pockets, raise their pant legs to see their socks, hand over all of their belongings to be hand checked, and get scanned by the metal detecting wand. I am certain that after this afternoon ritual all should feel safe, that is until you see students with cell phones and mp3 players that they were just searched for and found not to have. The students are not physically searched so it is impossible to know exactly what students have hidden under the folds of their clothes or in places that adults would not want to venture, so lets hope that no one gets the bright idea to make a weapon out of plastic. A positive environment means to me a place that a student wants to come to, a place that is safe and inviting, an environment that allows students with varying abilities and learning styles to gain an education that is their right to have as an American. Most students are greeted at the door by being bullied or antagonized by adults. Students have been turned away from school and told to go home because their socks are too short, or they forgot to bring notebook paper. These children should never be turned away from school, for some this is their last chance before juvenile detention. Parental involvement at Ramsey high is stressed so much that you think students could not function at school without a parent or guardian. For some students they are not allowed to come to school without one, these parents or guardians are called shadows. Some shadows are more disruptive in the classroom then the student. I watched parental involvement once, it consisted of a parent yanking on their childs hair while slapping them in the back of the head and cursing them, meanwhile no one steps in to aid the student. Is this what parental involvement really means? It is important to raise student achievement, but when a student understands that no matter what they do will still afford them at least a 65 for a grade, there is not much incentive for them to try. If the county wide policy is to never give a student less than a 65, then why not change the grading scale all together. Do we not have the power to do this; is this school system not the property of the community? There are so many things at Ramsey that need to be fixed; the school is being run for the benefit of the few while the many suffer every day. Class sizes are so out of control that students cannot learn and teachers cannot teach. There are classrooms with 2, 3, or 4 different class levels happening at the same time. Classes can get filled with over 30 students when the classes are not supposed to be bigger than 15. These students are considered by some to be the worst of the worst. Students with gang affiliations are put in classes with rival gang members, while the teacher is supposed to maintain control. Students curse teachers and walk out of class when they feel it necessary; other students get into slapping and cursing fests with another. If this happens in a teachers room then they are accused of having bad classroom management. Ramsey Street is supposed to be a reflection of other schools in the county so that when a student comes to the school they can pick up on all of the classes that their home school offered them. This is a situation that Ramsey cannot handle. The school is on a 3 x 3 block schedule instead of a 4 x 4 schedule like the rest of the county. Students who remain at Ramsey for an entire year are already losing 2 credits, and this situation is worse for anyone coming from Terry Sanford High School which is still on a 7 period schedule. So where did that 90 minutes go? Ramsey High School has to share a school with Ramsey Middle. This causes early hours for the middle school and very late hours for the high school. Are the students who attend these schools not important enough to the community to have their own schools with the same hours as the rest of the county? I watched the mistreatment of both teachers and students on a regular basis knowing that no matter whom I told, it just did not matter and nothing would change. These students deserve better from their community. Ramsey Street Alternative High School has become a glorified day care center for bad children and the teachers have become babysitters. I was convinced to take my grievances to a higher authority and was told that someone would come and investigate what was happening at Ramsey. What these students received was an appointment of someone to the board of education who would be in charge of all of the counties alternative programs. We do not need someone to convince parents and community members that having an alternative program is necessary. We need someone to convince the students and their guardians that coming to school at Ramsey will afford them an education. We need someone who will fix all of the things that went wrong at Ramsey Street Alternative High School. Please, do not take my word for what is happening at Ramsey, see for yourself, ask students, teachers, parents and community members who are directly involved with the school about what is going on there. If Ramsey Street Alternative High School is supposed to be the best program in the state then I would hate to see what is happening in the other alternative schools. I wanted to work with students at Ramsey because I grew up in similar situations to a lot of these students. I grew up in the county projects in Baltimore, was homeless, lived in foster homes and barely graduated from high school. I joined the military, was injured on a jump and finally entered college while in my 30s. Not only did I graduate in 3 years, but I graduated with two degrees and graduated Magna Cum Laude from a local University. I chose to teach because I taught when I was in the military, I worked with teenagers on an everyday basis and it seemed a logical thing to do. I have a lot to learn about teaching but I also have a lot of experience to offer my students. I was told that because I am a first year teacher and I have not taught before, nor have I worked with teenagers that I do not understand or know what I am doing when it comes to the types of students that go to Ramsey High. I was also told that because I am a teacher I will come to work early, stay late and do anything I am told to do and I am expected to obey, if there is a conflict with my life outside of school then I am required to bring in documentation showing conflict and then I may be able to work something out. When a first year teacher is willing to resign their position to change careers in the middle of the school year, something is very wrong. I wanted to be part of the solution, but when it became clear that-that would not happen, I had to leave because I no longer wanted to be part of the problem. Someone needs to be the voice for these children and I hope that the community will step in and become that voice so that our students and their families will regain the confidence in our school system that was once there. I take this stand at what could be great risk to me and my family because someone needs to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. Who am I but a parent of students in our school system, a teacher to our students, and a member of our community.

Mr. Profitt, Yes, we are aware of the rough ride. The NC DOT had us pave over buckled concrete and asphalt conforms to the surface below it. I believe they also had us patch concrete with asphalt, which just isnt done. In any case, the NC DOT has some engineering issues to work out and as I understand it, we are on hold until the NC DOT reworks its plans. Thank you for your feedback. Tom Purpur - Maymead I know one of the things you ran on in your campaign was NCDOT reform. Please take time to look into this for the hard working tax paying residents of Catawba County. Thanks for your time. God Bless.

Comment: I was recently told that several nursing positions will be cut from the local school system. In a recent news article the governor stated that teacher and state employees would not lose their jobs. What about the nurses? We are part of the team that helps students stay in school and learn. Recently there has been an increase in chronic and acute health conditions among the students. I want to continue my work with the schools. The state has worked hard to decrease the nurse student ratio. The action of eliminating school nurse positions is going backwards not forward. Thank you for listening. What can we do to save this from happening?
