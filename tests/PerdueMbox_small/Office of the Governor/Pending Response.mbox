Dear Governor Perdue.

Joan Edwards Pietras was assaulted by her husband on August 20, 2007,†while they were visiting Costa Rica for vacation and dental care.† She sustained a traumatic brain injury and remained in a coma for three weeks.† She lost 20% of her brain and will never be able to live independently again.† She is one of your constituents.

Her husband was arrested and jailed for about two months, then released on bond but required to remain in Costa Rica awaiting trial.† Mr. Pietras has not made any effort to support his wife since the assault.† Joan is living on the welfare of her brothers and sister.† You can find out more about the criminal case against Jon F. Pietras by contacting the US Embassy in Costa Rica, Mrs. Silvia Cabezas, <mailto:CabzasSM@state.gov>CabzasSM@state.gov or at 506 2519-2353.

On January 29, 2008, the Caldwell County Clerk of Court, Sandie Cannon, appointed Mr. Steven Potter, Esq. as Guardian of her Estate.† Our brother, Peter Edwards, was appointed Guardian of her Person.

Joan's estate consists of several profitable small businesses in Charlotte, NC, two rental properties, also in Charlotte, the marital home in Lenoir, and†some money in different banks.

Mr. Potter has failed to collect Joan's portion of the income from the businesses and rental properties.† Mr. Potter has also failed to provide any distribution of her estate for the purpose of supporting Joan.† The Clerk of Court is in collusion with him on this.

Criminal behavior by estate guardians is not unheard of.† There was a recent report in the Raleigh News and Observer of an incident.† Deadbeat husbands are also nothing new.† We know that the wheels of justice turn slow, but this train is off the track.† We have worked continuously trying to resolve the myriad of issues, but to know avail.† It is actually worse now than it was 18 months ago.

These are just the merest details of what has transpired over the last 16 months.† You were notified several weeks or months ago of these issues.† About the only thing I can determine has resulted is that I have been added to your emailing list.

This is a domestic assault case, with international criminal implications.† This is also a case of inept or criminal behavior by elected officials and their appointees.† You would think that responsible authorities would show more interest in addressing these issues, if only for the opportunitiy to place themselves in the limelight as champions of their less fortunate constituents.

Sincerely,

Philip Edwards

	<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/>


Gov. Perdue Announces†Plan to†Create Green Jobs

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>Governor Bev Perdue†this week†announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.
‚ÄúDeveloping our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolina‚Äôs economic future,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúCreating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.‚Äù
Gov. Perdue‚Äôs energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolina‚Äôs green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.
‚ÄúThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúI intend for North Carolina to be that state.‚Äù
Governor Perdue‚Äôs energy plan includes:
- Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce
- Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council

Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>‚ÄúJobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThe JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.‚Äù
The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success.†
Other JobsNOW initiatives include Perdue‚Äôs recently announced Green Energy Plan, the ‚Äú12 in 6‚Äù Worker Training Program, the Charlotte Area Workforce Recovery Plan and the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.
‚ÄúThis is a historic day for North Carolina,‚Äù said†Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúBut more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.‚Äù
According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.
"I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.
"This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.† Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.† I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.

Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

Gov. Perdue this week ordered the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and the State Highway Patrol to implement new travel record keeping protocols for security details assigned to both the governor and lieutenant governor.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúThis new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.‚Äù
The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.
‚ÄúGovernor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and that‚Äôs exactly what we intend to do,‚Äù said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.
All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governor‚Äôs term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.

Governor Bev Perdue

Office of the Governor

20301 Mail Service Center

Raleigh, NC 27699



Forwarded E-mail that was sent to the NC House Appropriations Sub-Committee for Health and Human Services.



May 24, 2009



RE: Appropriations Subcommittee of Health and Human Services:



Dear Committee Member:

My name is John Barker, Jr. and I live in Shelby, North Carolina in which I have lived all of my life. I am writing this letter to you on behalf of all deaf and hard of hearing students in North Carolina of which my eleven year old son, Jack Barker, falls into this category.



Jack was born with a serious heart anomaly and is a deaf and partially Blind child. Since Jack was eligible for public school, we have been blessed to have him enrolled in the public school system and have had great success during his early years at Jefferson and Graham Elementary schools in Shelby, North Carolina (our home town). As Jack aged, we observed his great interest and positive response to sign language while enrolled at Graham Elementary School.† As he grew in his ability to respond to sign language we were clearly told on behalf of the Cleveland County School system, that they were not equipped or had qualified personnel to provide education with integrating sign language. Not unlike other small to medium sized communities which are the predominant community sizes in North Carolina services were not available. We would only assume this to be the case in the majority of commutes throughout North Carolina.† Therefore, it was recommended by Jackís education providers and my wife and that a total sign language curriculum would be the most ìleast restrictive environment for Jack.



Although the ìleast restrictive environmentî definition in general typical means ìmainstreamingî, I do agree with The North Carolina Fiscal Research Division justification report issued March 28, 2007 stating. ìPrior to the Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with disabilities were often educated separately. The IDEA states the preference of educating students with disabilities is in the regular classroom. However, acknowledging that the regular classroom is not appropriate for all students with disabilities, IDEA requires that a full continuum of services be available to meet the needs of those students that cannot be educated in the regular classroomî.



Jack has been enrolled for three years at the North Carolina School for the Deaf in Morganton, and he has grown tremendously in his education. As parents, we have remained very involved at the school, attending various events, donating time and money, and sponsoring special events for the students on campus. Also, I am a member of the Human Rights Committee, which is similar to an executive team for Parent Teachers Association.† Rowena and I have been extremely pleased with the schoolís staff, physical plant and we endorse the decisions made by the leadership of the school. Clearly, the schoolís focus is on the students, their education, and the quality of life of the boarding students.



For folks without a child with special needs, it is challenging to effectively describe the benefits of an environment that truly provides integrated educational services and personal care. Mainstream programs, although generally good, lack the skill level to provide the necessary educational intensity from accredited professionals. For these kids to have every opportunity to fulfill their potential, they deserve to be offered the highest quality education to meet their needs which legally should be provided by right. My point here is that mainstream programs do not provide the education equivalency to that of non-special needs children in school today and I can share with you many studies pointing to this claim.



The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, (IDEA), which in essence is a modified, more modern version of the 1975 Public Law 94-142 (Education of All Handicapped Children Act), is somewhat controversial in that it stipulates that Deaf students, (or any student with a disability), are to be placed in the "Least Restrictive Environment". Some have interpreted this to mean moving them into mainstream classrooms with minimal barriers, making learning experiences as identical to those as hearing students. However, others have argued that "least restrictive environment" for a Deaf student would mean an environment with ASL being used as a primary means of communications, more visual learning tools, guarantees of things such as accommodations for things such as visual alarm systems and signals, and peer interaction with other Deaf students. Since advocates of this type of environment argue that Deaf Culture, not just Deaf people, are the issue here, "least restrictive" means much more than simply trying to make people with audio logical impairments "normal" by the standards set forth by the hearing public. According to the National Education Association web site, IDEA provides for:



"Access-Assuring that student with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum and appropriate general education classes Discipline-Assuring that there are alternative placement options for dangerous students so they can continue their education without hampering the education of other students Assessment- Assuring the accurate and appropriate assessment of the academic achievement of students with disabilities."From NEA website. For this reason, many accredited professionals and educators believe that a separate, Deaf school is the "Least Restrictive Environment" for Deaf students to learn in.



My prologue provides you with some overview on Jack and our thoughts as parents, which leads me to the major concern regarding the future of North Carolina School for the Deaf. My wife Rowena and I have discovered that the State of North Carolina has been in the process of evaluating plans for a possible consolidation or closure of the North Carolina School for the Deaf in Morganton (NCSD), Eastern School for the Deaf in Wilson,(ESD) and Governor Morehead School for the Blind,(GMS) in Raleigh.



Our understanding is that the North Carolina fiscal research department completed a study to determine cost savings for consolidation or closing of the schools. In addition we understand that a deadline of May 27, 2009 has been set in which to make a recommendation to the North Carolina House which will make final budget recommendation on June 16, 2009. After conversations with Dwight Pearson I understand the recommendations are as follows:



1.††† GMS and EMS to remain open, NCSD to close

2.††† GMS to remain open, EMS, NCSD to close

3.††† EMS to remain open, GMS, NCSD to close

4.††† EMS, NCSD to remain open, GMS to close.



However, we understand that there is general consensus to consolidate NCDS and GMS to ESD.



In addition we understand that the total costs savings for a 1 school model would be $17,000,000 and in a 2 school model the total cost would be $21,000,000 representing a estimate of $7,000,000 in savings.



Although we understand that North Carolina is in a financial crisis, we do believe that a decision for closure via consolidations will have a huge impact on deaf students and families in Western North Carolina. As advocates for all of the children as well as our son, Jack, we wish to bring this to seek your counsel on providing a most probable way to mitigate this from happening.



Already to-date, North Carolina School for the Deaf has reduced its budget of approximately ten million by†eleven percent (11%) and is operating with†one million less than its operating budget requires. The staff there has incurred salary reductions, services have been reduced to accommodate the request by North Carolina, yet the school maintains its focus on education and the students. Many staff members have made significant sacrifices for the students and for the good of the mission and purpose of the school.† To me, it is hard to imagine operating in this capacity; most organizations couldnít pull it off.†† Today the school provides for 104 students but can accommodate up to 250 students without additional renovation costs. One hundred percent†of the†faculty is†considered to be highly qualified under the No Child Left behind legislation.† Many of the paraprofessionals that provide direct services to the students†have degrees from community colleges, colleges and university which exceed†the job qualifications.†The school is fully accredited by CASI- SACS the accreditation agent for southeastern United States..†



The physical plant is in excellent condition and within the last five years, the main building was completely renovated with building refurbishment completed for the upper school totaling over twenty million in improvements.



I wanted to share some points about this issue of closure and consolidation, advocating for serious consideration to keep the North Carolina School for the Deaf open. Below are some of my points I wish to make for your consideration.



Dollars and Budget



-†††††† Central School was closed in 2000 resulting in 4.5 million in savings



-†††††† NC General Assembly reduced appropriations by 6.2 million in 2001



-†††††† NCDS reduced its operating budget by 11% in 2008 to 8.9 million



-†††††† In the March 28, 2007 NC fiscal research justification reports it states that the residential schools budget grew by 18.7%. Are you aware of the fact that according the 2008 Public Schools of NC report that the public schools cost to serve students which is in essence reflective of the budget increased by 13% for the same time period.† I think this is pretty consistent. I also found it interesting in the fiscal research report it states ìThe average cost to educate a hearing or visually impaired student in a general education classroom was not examined in this study.î



-†††††† In a public school setting the approximate teacher / staff ratios are about 1 to 25 +/- whereas in a residential ìspecial needsî setting the ratios are 1 to 3 and in a mainstream special needs program often 1 to 5.† The fact is special needs kids whether in a public school setting or not will require higher staff ratios. The other important issue to take into consideration is how you compare the cost for service. According to the statistical profile for 2008 completed by the North Carolina Department of Instruction the cost to provide services for a typical student is $8,017.



The best way to compare is to consider what the hourly cost for services comparing public school to a residential school setting. Below I have outlined the math for this calculation.



††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† NCSD†††††††††††††††††††††††† Public School per NCDPI data

Hours of service per week†††††††††††††††† 108 (24hrsX4.5 days) 30 (6.5 hrs X 5 days)

Hours of service per year (9 Mos)†††† 972††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† 270

Cost of services one to one††††††††††††††† $28,526†††††††††††††††††††††† $8,017

Hourly rate†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† $29.35†††††††††††††††††††††††† $29.65



For this model we have noted the following:



1.††† NCSD budget $8,900,000

2.††† NCSD has a three shift operation (8 hours per shift) unlike public school at single shift (6.5 hours per day/shift)

3.††† Actual cost per shift NCSD $8,900,000 / 3 = $2,966,666

4.††† Actual cost per student per shift $2,966,666 / 104 (total number of students) = $28,526.

5.††† $28,526 / total hours required = $29.35 per hour.



It is very apparent that when you consider the ratios required for student teacher and you actually consider the true cost per services provided that the NCSD cost is slightly less than that of public school education costs.



Although total costs are relative in your decision please understand the competiveness of the services provided compared to public programs is excellent.



Physical Plant



Currently the residential dorm at NCDS is set up to accommodate 200 +/- students and was recently renovated in the last three years to be a state of the art residential building along with staff offices. The NCSD campus is part of an 800 acre state owned property connected to Broughton Hospital. At is prime enrollment NCSD had over 800 students on campus Please see the aerial photo below which details some of the key features to this campus.



-†††††† NCSD can accommodate today a capacity of 200 with no additional costs to North Carolina.



-†††††† The residential dorm facility is 100% conditioned unlike Eastern School for the deaf that does not have AC in the dormitory.



-†††††† In order to accommodate 250 students Hoffemeyer Hall can accommodate an additional 50 students. Currently the facility is up to code and is a certified facility with all life safety issues current.





-†††††† The facility does not need anything to operate to accommodate 250 children. No renovations would be required to operate and have students live in this facility immediately.



-†††††† In addition to the dorm facilities having the capacity to serve with no additional renovation costs, the campus has a full size gymnasium, football field and stadium and additional playing fields, chapel, a designated lower school and upper school that we just renovated and occupied† this year.































































Travel / Quality of Life



As you may be aware just like public school, transportation is provided to and from school on a weekly basis. North Carolina School for the Deaf currently serves about half of the counties in North Carolina, predominately in western North Carolina and the Piedmont. As of today the farthest east location is Hamlet, NC and the farthest west is Hendersonville, NC. Also included is a typical farthest west location for comparisons being Bryson City, NC. I have completed below a drive time analysis that supports the travel time from these farthest points to demonstrate the time in which it would take to commute one way. Students are transported each Sunday from a selected location to Morganton and likewise on Friday they are transported back to their selected location to be at home for the weekend.



If we assume that Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf is the only school to remain open the drive time analysis will provide a clear understanding of the challenge this would be for students.



To Eastern School for Deaf

Location †††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Miles †††††††††††††††††††††††††† Time in Transit no stops

Hendersonville, NC†††††††††††††††373 miles†††††††††††††††††††† 5 hours 45 minutes

Bryson City, NC††††††††††††††††††††† 445 miles†††††††††††††††††††† 7 hours 1 minute

Hamlet, NC†††††††††††††††††††††††††††† 156 miles†††††††††††††††††††† 2 hours 45 minutes



To North Carolina School for Deaf

Location †††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Miles †††††††††††††††††††††††††† Time in Transit no stops

Hendersonville, NC†††††††††††††††† 69 miles††††††††††††††††††††† 1 hour 25 minutes

Bryson City, NC††††††††††††††††††††† 115 miles†††††††††††††††††††† 2 hours 1 minute

Hamlet, NC†††††††††††††††††††††††††††† 202 miles†††††††††††††††††††† 3 hours 24 minutes



As you can see the travel time from todayís farthest western point would† 5 hours and 45 minutes, which is a too far for a student to travel to school. This does not account for possible multiple stops to pick up other students at locations along the way as well as restroom breaks and eating. That being said we could assume an additional 1 ñ 2 hours to the overall drive. Typically students leave school at 12:00 PM on Friday which would equate to an arrival time to their selected location of 7:00 PM Returning on Sunday in order to arrive for dinner at 7:00 PM the departure time would need to be 12:00 PM on Sunday. This does not allow time for much family time over the weekend, neither time to go to church in order to depart on time.



This would be an extremely unfair situation for many families or children to endure this lengthy travel time just to receive their education.



Economic Impact



As you may be aware, currently the unemployment rate in Morganton is 17% plus. The Hickory/ Morganton MSA is currently the highest unemployed MSA in the state of North Carolina.† A closure of this school would create a huge negative impact to an already distressed community. Not only would the 180 jobs at the school be lost, but all of the ancillary service providers supporting the school would also experience cuts.



My request is for your assistance in determining any information relative to the proposed consolidation recommendations that have been made to North Carolina and to hopefully review these recommendations. This in turn will allow the childrenís parents, staff and advocates a chance to understand the issues and alternatives being considered and to provide input as to the efficacy of a consolidation or closure of any of the three schools.



I greatly appreciate you assistance in this matter and thank you for your time to help not only me but the other families that would be dramatically affected by any change. I would appreciate greatly a chance to meet with you in person or over the phone to discuss these points made and to have dialogue with you about the challenges this would provide for these children and their families.



I can be best reached the following ways: (1) cell† phone 704-481-5560, (2) home phone 704-480-9575 and (3) office phone 980-233-3826 or via e-mail at <mailto:jbarker@redrockdevelopments.com>jbarker@redrockdevelopments.com.

Overview and History of North Carolina School for the Deaf



Historical Background:



The day/boarding educational complex called The North Carolina School for the Deaf opened its doors to 104 white deaf students in 1894. By this opening it inherited a rich and varied past history of deaf education.



Education of deaf children in America can be traced to its permanent roots with the opening of The American School for the Deaf in Hartford, CT, in 1817. Laurent Clerc (1785-1869), a deaf teacher, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet (1787-1851), a hearing teacher, and Mason Finch Cogswell (1761-1830), parent of a deaf child, teamed up to make this school a reality. One of Gallaudet's sons, Edward Miner, was the first president of (now) Gallaudet University, founded in 1864. Higher education for deaf students is an unique status that is American. To this day, 136 years later, Gallaudet University continues to be the only liberal arts university for deaf students anywhere in the world. Two streets on the NCSD campus are named in honor of Clerc and Gallaudet.



In 1845 education of white deaf children and white Blind children originated in Raleigh as The North Carolina Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. This was the ninth state operated school for deaf children in America. It was common in those days to share a campus with Blind children. In 1869 funds were provided for a separate school for black deaf children and black Blind children in a separate section of Raleigh. It was the first school of its kind in the South. Separation of races ended with the Civil Rights Act of 1963.



Around 1890 the educational trend was to have separate schools for deaf children and Blind children. This led to a series of hearings that, in turn, led to legislative action. The end result was funding for a new school for deaf children and its location in Morganton, both in 1891. The prime advocate for a new school was Edward McKee Goodwin (1859-1937) of Raleigh who, in 1894, became the first superintendent, an appointment he held until 1936. The person instrumental for the location of the new school in Morganton was Col. Samuel McDowell Tate (1830-1897) of Morganton. The school for the Blind remained in Raleigh as The Governor Morehead School.



Goodwin said that the new school had only one mission: the education of deaf children. To make his point clear from the beginning, he made sure that the first brick was laid by two deaf children from the Raleigh school: Maggie LeGrand and Robert C. Miller did the honors on May 16, 1892.



The original corporate name of the Morganton school on the day it opened was The North Carolina School for the Deaf and Dumb. Legislative action in 1916 changed the corporate name to The North Carolina School for the Deaf, the name it still retains.



Physical Plant



"Main Building," the name given to the centralized building with the prominent clock tower, was designed by A.G. Bauer, a Raleigh architect. Construction started in 1892 and was completed on time for opening day in 1894. After several alterations during its 106 years, Main Building is now undergoing a major upgrading slated for completion in the summer of 2003.



The most important work is the upgrading to 21st century building codes for fire, access, and safety in terms of meeting the unique needs for visually oriented deaf children. This upgrade will make the building one of the safest living units for such children anywhere in North Carolina. Extensive fiberglass wiring will provide full use of educational computer technology. All of this is an example of the long time financial support given to NCSD by the NC Legislature.



Main Building is on The National Register of Historic Places. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 encourages the identification of buildings that significant in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture. After the opening of Main Building, a series of some 20 building units were Constructed between 1900 to 1975 in order to keep up with the increased student enrollments.



Administration:



from 1891 to 1971, the primary governing body of NCSD was a Board of Directors as empowered by the Legislature to function. The members of the Board were appointed by the Governor for stated terms. In 1971-72 the Legislature reorganized state agencies into departments at the top, with divisions placed under the appropriate department. This format has continued down to this day with the re-naming of some departments and divisions as changing times warranted.

In the spring of 2000 The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) placed NCSD under the jurisdiction of The Division of Early Intervention and Education (DEIE).

Past NCSD superintendents: Edward McKee Goodwin(1894-1937), Carl E. Rankin (1937-1955), Ben E. Hoffmeyer (1955-1970), Charles L. Henderson (1970-1990), William M. Simpson (acting 1990-1991), Elmer L. Dillingham,Jr.(1991-1995), Charles Bernardo (interim1995), Gary Mowl (1995-1998), Kent Mann (1999-2003), Seth Hunt (interim 2003-2005), Linda Lindsey (2005-2008), currently Janet McDaniel (interim beginning 2008).



Classroom Instruction:



Education of deaf children has long been based on a curriculum modeled after those of public schools, which also provided a standard for accreditation purposes.

†A long time issue among educators of deaf children was how to instruct those children in the classroom. Should the teachers use speech all the time and expect the children to respond in kind? Should the teachers use American Sign Language (ASL) and expect the children to respond in kind? Should the teachers use a combination of speech and ASL and expect the children to respond in kind?



Since its founding NCSD was flexible in its approach to the instruction issue on the basis that the instruction must meet the needs of the child, not the other way around. The combined classroom and dormitory environments provided opportunities for each child to meet his/her maximum potential. This potential includes full involvement in student activities and sports participation. Deaf adults, both classroom instructors and dormitory counselors, contributed to this potential, too.



Today a federally mandated Individual Educational Plan (IEP), designed with parental involvement, spells out the courses of instruction and classroom communication method for each deaf child. NCSD, with its long time flexibility in meeting a deaf child's individual needs, is well suited for the future.



A contributing factor of NCSD's quality classroom instruction was having its own training program for teachers of deaf children, which was started the same year the school first opened, in 1894. The program is now offered as a college major at near-by Lenoir-Rhyne College in Hickory.



For any school the end results are its graduates. NCSD graduated 1,791 students between 1895 to 2000, for an average of 17 students per graduation. A statement of the success of these grads are best expressed by a slogan NCSD used on its postage meter stamps for many years: "NC Deaf - Productive Citizens."



Combined Communities: Morganton, Burke, and NCSD



NCSD became a legislative fact in 1891. Since then its payroll, local purchasing, employee salaries, and student spending have combined to make the school a part of the local economy. NCSD's school population decreased over the past years.†However, this has not stopped NCSD from moving on to provide for the future of its students.† Student enrolled at NCSD have the opportunity to be dually enrolled at Western Piedmont Community College and recieve high school and college credit.



Probably the biggest and oldest inter-action between the combined communities was in the field of sports. There was intense sports rivalry from 1926 to 1972 between NCSD and these former high schools : Morganton, Glen Alpine, Drexel, Oak Hill, and Salem. The rivalry in football, basketball, and track spawned several school generations that still remember "those games."





Freedom and East Burke, as 4A powerhouses, closed all local competition for NCSD in 1972. Since then NCSD found comparable sports competition with schools for the deaf in surrounding states. Athletic programs continue to be one of the best extra curricular activities at NCSD.



In June 1972 NCSD hosted the World Games for the Deaf US team tryouts. 480 deaf athletes from all over the country participated in volleyball, wrestling, tennis, swimming and track and field. This four day event was made possible by the sharing of facilities at Freedom High, Morganton Recreation Center, and NCSD. The News-Herald called it the largest sports event ever held in Morganton.



Jim Lowdermilk, a Morganton accountant, probably said it best about the Morganton/Burke/NCSD communities when he spoke before a Task Force to Examine Issues Facing NC Schools for the Deaf in 1987. He stated: "The Deaf have become an intricate part of our corporate world and our culture. This school (NCSD) is not superimposed on our community, it is our community."

Comment: Governor Perdue, Could you please take a public position on the recent problems of special favors, favorable real estate deals, free travel, unreported funds from supporters, cushy jobs, etc., that are arising from former Democratic Governor Mike Easley's two terms in office? I am a registered Democrat but I am sad to be affiliated with a political party that is showing such disregard for the people of North Carolina. As someone in Mike Easley's previous administration, I surely hope you are above the mess he has found himself in. In the future I will vote for leaders who show integrity, honesty, openness, and respect for North Carolina and her citizens. We deserve it!. Sincerely, Elaine F. Odom

It could be a DPI issue depending on whether or not the county has a contract with DPIís Plant Operation Section.† That area houses building system engineerís that will assist with various building issues.† Have the person contact them at 919-807-3541 John Kuchnia is the Section Chief.

North Carolina Office of the Governor

Honorable Governor Beverly M. Perdue

20301 Mail Service Center

Raleigh, NC 27699



Dear Governor Perdue:



I have attached a pdf copy of a Resolution from the Morganton Kiwanis Club that calls on the Burke County School board members to correct any valid issues addressed in the 4/24/09 SACS/CASI letter and any other matter that could lead to our high schools losing their national accreditation.



The Morganton Kiwanis organization has a long history of supporting education in Burke County and club members are extremely disappointed and concerned with recent events of the school board.††Throughout its history, club members have carried the torch for education and were in fact, instrumental in founding Western Piedmont Community College. †Three of the campus buildings and a library†are named after past club members.††Every club member in attendance during its May 18, 2009 meeting voted in favor of this resolution.†



Founded in 1922, the Morganton Kiwanis Club is a community service organization†of volunteers who are dedicated to changing the world one child at a time.† Club members believe that†when a child is given a†chance to learn, experience, dream, and succeed, great things happen.



This is not just a local issue, but one that could bring great harm to the entire state of North Carolina.† Immediate action must be taken to ensure our stateís economy will not suffer negatively because of the numerous irresponsible and perhaps illegal actions of this school board.†



If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.† We appreciate your attention to this matter.†



Morganton Kiwanis President-Elect

Ron LaSalle



Sincerely,



Ron LaSalle

I recently saw that Executive Order Number 12 was signed by our Governor and I want you to know that I was please to see this happen.  For many years, North Carolina has suffered with the problems of ex-offenders re-entering the criminal justice system after what is often a short period of freedom.  This action was long overdue but it is a good start to what I hope will be significant with the appointment of a Task Force and their eventual action.  I commend the Governor on her important action to address the problem. 

I would also like to recommend someone to the Task Force.  Mr. Dennis Gaddy was at on time an incarcerated inmate.  He was released and started work to help inmates re-enter normal life here in North Carolina.  He created Community Success Initiative (CSI).  This non-profit organization began its work in the Raleigh area  a few years ago and has since touched the lives of many released inmate.  They don't just deal with one  or two of the needs of this population.  They work to address all aspects, dealing with developing a support mechanism, getting a home, finding a job, dealing with transportation issues, etc. Mr. Gaddy has put together an organization from the bottom up and at current time, they have served thousands of people. 

I have worked closely with Mr. Gaddy in the Wake County area and now I have moved to Moore County and we have begun the initial steps of expanding the organization to serve this area.  I am aware that he has plans to expand into other parts of the state as well. 

I hope you will be able to find a spot for him on the Governor's Safestreet Task Force.  His experience as a former inmate and now a community activist will provide some great insight to the problem to be addressed by the Task Force. 

I appreciate your time taken to read my message and commend you for this action take to improve the lives of so many North Carolinians.

I would be interested in knowing how much it would save the taxpayers if government and city employees were not given government cars; just mileage for using their own personal vehicles.  I was just curious.

Tar Heel Day in North Carolina

Wednesday afternoon, Governor Perdue greeted the UNC Tar Heels Men's Basketball team at the Governor's Mansion.† In recognition of winning the 2009 NCAA National Championship, Governor Perdue proclaimed†Wednesday as "Tar Heel Day."† Along with the proclamation, Coach Roy Williams and the Tar Heels were given the Laurel Wreath Award for their accomplishments, and Coach Williams presented the Governor with a basketball signed by the entire team.†

Nuclear Energy Engineering Firm Bringing 194 Jobs to Charlotte

Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp., a nuclear power plant engineering and construction management company, will open its national project management and engineering center in Mecklenburg County.† The company plans to invest $2.8 million and create 194 new jobs in Charlotte during the next five years.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina is a world leader in providing the knowledge-based workforce, design and research support vital to the development of the energy sector,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúOur state‚Äôs business-friendly policies and unparalleled quality of life continue to attract top global companies and high-paying jobs.‚Äù
The state‚Äôs Economic Investment Committee awarded a Job Development Investment Grant to Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp. to facilitate this new project.† While wages will vary by position, the company plans to create new jobs with an average annual wage of $122,037, not including benefits.† This greatly exceeds the Mecklenburg County average annual wage of $49,400.
Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp., based in Virginia, is part of Toshiba America Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. The company markets and sells advanced boiling water nuclear reactors (ABWR) to be constructed in the United States and provides engineering, licensing, construction management, maintenance and other services for nuclear power plants. The company also sells turbines and other major equipment for nuclear power plants.
Job Development Investment Grants are awarded only to new and expanding businesses and industrial projects whose benefits exceed the costs to the state and†would not be undertaken in North Carolina without the grant.† Since the first grant was awarded in 2003, the program has been responsible for creating commitments for more than 30,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment in North Carolina.
Other partners that assisted with this announcement include: the N.C. Department of Commerce, the N.C. Department of Revenue, the Charlotte Regional Partnership, Mecklenburg County, City of Charlotte and the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.

Governor Perdue Takes Additional Steps to Ensure a Balanced Budget

Gov. Bev Perdue is taking additional steps to ensure the state‚Äôs budget is balanced on June 30, 2009.† The move comes in response to an analysis by the Office of State Budget Management that indicates the budget shortfall for fiscal year 2008-09 will likely exceed $3 billion.
Gov. Perdue this week signed Executive Order 11, which implements a flexible furlough program for all state employees.† This furlough equates to $65 million this year.† In addition, she has identified funds to close the remaining budget gap for the fiscal year, which include capturing more special funds, tapping the state‚Äôs Savings Reserve Account and utilizing federal recovery dollars.† These measures total more than $1 billion.
All teachers‚Äô and state employees‚Äô compensation will be reduced by an annualized amount equivalent to 0.5 percent for the remainder of the fiscal year. Each employee will receive 10 hours of flexible time off in exchange.† The governor has asked the General Assembly to pass legislation holding longevity pay, unused leave, service credit and health and retirement benefits harmless.
‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to experience the effects of a national economic crisis, which force me to make difficult decisions in order to maintain a balanced budget through June,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI will do what I must in order to ensure that North Carolina can pay our bills and provide the essential services required by our citizens.‚Äù

Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Outreach from the Department of Transportation

NCDOT recognizes the importance of giving all businesses the opportunity to do work with the department on transportation projects. Unfortunately, not all businesses have the resources and contacts necessary to find out about these contracts. Through the department‚Äôs Business Opportunity and Workforce Development Office, NCDOT is holding a series of outreach meetings in the state aimed at informing Disadvantaged Business Enterprises of contracting opportunities in transportation and on projects funded with monies from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
A Disadvantaged Business Enterprise is a small, independent business that is at least 51 percent minority- or women-owned. At least one of these owners must control the firm's management and daily operations, and the owners must share in the risks and profits commensurate with their ownership interest.
These outreach meetings give DBE‚Äôs†opportunities to network, to hear from NCDOT field personnel about upcoming available contracts and to learn how to become a certified and prequalified contractor.†
So far, these meetings have received great response from businesses that otherwise would not have had as many opportunities to work on NCDOT projects. To date, meetings have been held in Asheville, Charlotte, Edenton, Fayetteville, Raleigh and Wilson. Upcoming meetings will take place in†Winston-Salem, Greenville, Greensboro, Carthage and Castle Hayne.††Click here for the†locations, dates and times.

Good afternoon.† i am sending this email as a consequence of incident outside of my control.† I am sending this with humble sincerity in search of assistance.† I moved to North Carolina in 2004 to assist my mother with my younger siblings while she went to school to obtain her LPN.† My mother moved here in 2001 from Philadelphia PA to seek closure from my step father's murder and to give my younger siblings a better environment.† Anyways, in 02/09 she went to Philadelphia to witness the birth of her third grandchild.† In the course of her visit she was arrested on what was claimed to be a warrant for probation violation.† The charge originated in Harrisburg PA from a DUI charge she received in 1999, less than a year after my step father's murder.† She was ordered to serve probation, but we were under the impression that it was successfully completed and that the fines associated with the charge were waived.† She had no idea that this loomed over her head.† She had to obtain clearance from Pennsylvania to get her North Carolina driving license and also her license to be a LPN and both times it came back clean.† Now she is being told that she can not leave Pennsylvania until the fine of $1600.00 + is paid.† She was released in March 2009 and was told that she had 90 days to pay the fine in full and could not leave the state.† She has not been able to pay the fine due to having to provide for my two minor siblings that are still in North Carolina.†† She is not working full time.† And the 90 days will be up in June.† I am working to help pay the bills here but due to the fact that I am only working part time I can not afford to pay the bills without her help.† I am in desperate need of any advice.† Is there any way that anyone in your office can contact Pennsylvania about this matter.† This whole situation has ill effected our small family.† Before all of this took place she was starting a RN class.† Her car was reposessed because the dealership was told that she could not leave PA.† My brother and sister have been emotionally startled by this whole situation.† Not only have they lost their father but now are in jeopardy of having their only remaining parent falsely incarcerated.†

Dear Madame Governor,

††††FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS "MY" LIFE.† ONE LIFE.† THAT IS ALL I HAVE.† I†KNOW MY LIFE MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU.† THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS LETTER.† I NEED AN URGENT REPLY FROM YOU AND I†AM REQUESTING †TO MEET WITH YOU AND WILL CALL YOUR OFFICE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AFTER I GAIN THE ATTENTION OF SOME SUPPORTERS TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT ISSUES. † I WANT TO MEET WITH YOU ALONE AND THEN HEAR FROM MY OTHER SUPPORTERS.† PLEASE† SHOW ME THE RESPECT, COMPASSION AND ATTENTION I DESERVE AT THIS POINT.† I received a most distressing letter today in the mail from the Clemency Office that stated you were denying my request for a pardon for the slap I attempted to give to my ex-husband, Howard Jordan, in 2002.† You know I could have lied in court like he did and not been convicted, but the Lord Jesus would not accept lies with my hand on the Bible.† You can choose to believe that or not.† But one thing is for sure, I AM HONEST.† I have studied the other offenses in North Carolina like drug possession, larceny, setting property on fire, etc. that are still up for a pardon from you.† Surely my one little slap will not prevent you from a just pardon if you REALLY KNOW with evidence that I had been so provoked for so long that I finally broke.† THIS IS CALLED BEING HUMAN.† I have some spunk just like you do when battling congress for help for North Carolina ,but mine is a completely different situation.† †I do not know what kind of compassion or ethics are present in your office and I cannot accept this without you putting yourself in my shoes for 20 long years of provocation and utter abuse, mentally, emotionally and physically on my person to the point I DID raise my hand to slap him.† Some women cower down and fold.† They go to mental institutions and hospitals and the shelter for battered women.† But I will NOT cower down Governor Perdue.† What has been done to me is cruel and inhumane and I crush†cruelty and I fight back against such abuse on me and many others so that victims might prosper.† SURELY YOU SUPPORT THE SAME.†

††††YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY NOT ALLOW ME TO PROSPER NOW WITH AN UNDESERVED AND LEGALLY ABUSIVE SITUATION LIKE MY EX-HUSBAND HAS PRESENTED.† YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE ALL THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN MY FILE AT THE CLEMENCY DEPARTMENT AS I HAD TO CORRECT BARRY JENKINS THERE BEFORE GOVERNOR PERDUE.

††††I am calling your offices and asking for an appointment so we can sit down like two mature supportive women just like you and Kay Hagan do in congress and work out something not just for me to prosper with a needed pardon, as I have to even lower myself and my dignity to go this route to begin with, and as I really do not need YOUR approval or not as you HAVE NOT been in my shoes and I do not deserve your judgment until you have been exactly where I have been, but your understanding.† I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD TURN YOUR BACK ON MY DISTRESS NOW.† NO.† I NEED EMPLOYMENT.† IT IS NOT POSSIBLE†FOR YOU TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION ON ME OR†YOU HAVE NO HEART.† AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART MADAME GOVERNOR.† YOU SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

††††I am going to call your office and set up a time when we can meet and intelligently discuss a plan to help me personally get ahead in life and for the two of us to work out a jobs program for battered women and other victims of court abuse by abusive ex-husbands in our state.† I KNOW YOU WILL NOT TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.† LORD JESUS, OPEN THIS DOOR FOR ME AND THE MANY OTHERS TO GAIN OUR GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT AT THIS TIME.

Dear Governor Perdue:

I am a state employee and a Registered Nurse.† I am appalled at how poorly state employees are being treated.† I literally feel as though my pocket is being picked.† The same people who have mismanaged our monies and already dip into our paychecks (we have no choice in the matter) now need more cash.† Who to get if from?? Those that have no recourse.† Why do a few of NC's citizens have to pay for all??† I am beginning to believe that all politicians are a sham.† Is Mary Easley giving anything back??? How about former Governor Easley??

In my opinion, the state of NC is just asking for union intervention, state healthcare employees and teachers†would †love to sign up for†union respresentation right about now!†† Also, we would like to know what is being taken from elected state officials??? What are they doing to help? What are you giving up??

When will a full accounting of how these funds are being used and distributed be available??† It was my hard earned cash.... and I would like to know!!

Dear Governor Perdue,



With regard to our state revenue dropping, could offshore drilling help our economy? I would only be in favor of doing so if it could be done safely so we do not adversely affect our beaches, etc..



A separate question: Could the NC State Lottery System be remodeled to resemble the State of Ga.?† †In Ga., the HOPE Scholarship provides a free college education for students who have a B average in high school and attend a Ga. University and also maintain a B average in college?

Gov. Perdue Announces†Plan to†Create Green Jobs

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>Governor Bev Perdue†this week†announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.
ìDeveloping our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolinaís economic future,î Gov. Perdue said. ìCreating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.î
Gov. Perdueís energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolinaís green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.
ìThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,î Gov. Perdue said. ìI intend for North Carolina to be that state.î
Governor Perdueís energy plan includes:
- Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce
- Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council
- Establishing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund
- Expanding the Green Business Fund
- Growing North Carolinaís green workforce
- Investing federal recovery monies for other energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in small businesses, communities and homes across North Carolina

Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>ìJobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThe JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.î
The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdueís JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success.†
Other JobsNOW initiatives include Perdueís recently announced Green Energy Plan, the ì12 in 6î Worker Training Program, the Charlotte Area Workforce Recovery Plan and the N.C. Office of Economic Recovery and Investment.

Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.
ìThis is a historic day for North Carolina,î said†Gov. Perdue. ìBut more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.î
According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.
"I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.
"This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.† Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.† I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.

Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

ìIíve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThis new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.î
The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.
ìGovernor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and thatís exactly what we intend to do,î said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.
All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governorís term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.

This sounds like a great plan, I hope it works!!† I do have one question though - what exactly is a "green job"?† Nobody has ever been able to answer that for me.† Would farming be considered "green"?† Or would it be something else.† Am very curious as to what a green job is.
Thanks!!!

Preparing for Hurricane Season

Hurricane Season begins on Monday and ends on Nov. 30.††North Carolina will be ready in the event†of a†tropical storm or hurricane.† In addition to encouraging North Carolina's families to prepare, Gov. Perdue is working to ensure that the state is prepared to respond to a disaster.† On Thursday, Gov. Perdue, cabinet officials and state emergency management officials†conducted a simulation exercise, rehearsing the roles and responsibilities of each agency during a disaster.†

> <hurricane-fran-nasa1.jpg>In addition, Gov. Perdue proclaimed this week "Hurricane Preparedness Week."† This year marks the 10th anniversary of the stateís costliest and most destructive storm.† On Sept. 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck our state leaving behind 52 deaths and $6 billion in damages.†

> ìIn North Carolina we understand from experience the power and destruction of hurricanes.† With hurricane season approaching, I ask us all to be prepared,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìI urge all families, businesses and local governments to check your emergency plans and emergency kits before any disaster strikes.î†

> North Carolina ranks second only to Florida in vulnerability to hurricanes. Citizens are urged to assemble emergency supply kits, then make and rehearse plans for where to go and what to do if a hurricane threatens the state.

> Citizens are also encouraged to review and update their homeownersí insurance policies to make sure they include coverage for accidental damage and natural disasters and, if necessary, flood insurance.

> Families should have an emergency plan and emergency supplies kit ready to go at all times.† The kit should contain enough non-perishable food and a gallon of water per person per day to last three to seven days.† The kit should also include the following essentials:

> ∑†††††††† Copies of insurance papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag

> ∑†††††††† First-aid kit

> ∑†††††††† Cash or checkbook

> ∑†††††††† Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records

> <attaba00.JPG>People should stay informed during a storm by keeping a battery-powered radio for weather and evacuation information and should know evacuation routes in their community.† They also need to heed the warnings of state and local officials and evacuate quickly when told to do so.

> Citizens can evacuate their homes with small, domestic pets to specially designated pet-friendly shelters.† Pet shelters will be equipped with pet crates, but people should bring feeding dishes, food and water, immunization papers and other pet supplies.

Contracts have been awarded for 17 additional highway projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts total $102.8 million and were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> <Newsletter Logo.jpg>ìThese projects will help create and sustain thousands of jobs and provide needed economic development in counties throughout North Carolina,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThey will improve critical routes to help better connect North Carolinians around the state.î

> The projects are in Alamance, Alexander, Anson, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Cherokee, Cleveland, Cumberland, Durham, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, Nash, Rockingham, Surry, Union, Wake and Yadkin counties. Two resurfacing projects, one on U.S. 64 in Nash/Edgecombe counties and one on I-440 in Wake County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met ìgood faith effortî requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=424>> For a list of the projects, see the attached documents here.

> The bids received on all 17 economic recovery projects came in nearly 25 percent, about $36.7 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts will start in late June or early July.

> The transportation projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.

To whom it may concern:

I am writing you begging for guidance on what I can do to save my job.  I was told today that I have lost my job.  I have been teaching for two years but an assistant at this same school for 7 years.  Because I am an ILT, I was one of the three that lost our job at Hominy Valley Elem. in Buncombe County.  This was pretty much a shock.  My principals words were yesterday that she didn't think I had any thing to worry about.  Today I leave my home of 9 years as well as my work family with great sadness and bitterness.  I have been focused on being a teacher all my life.  It took me longer than some to finish my degree but now I am working on my masters.  I am extremely scared and sad about my job loss.  I read all over how important it is to teach and touch our future.  I can honestly say that I give all my heart to my students as well as their families.  It bothers me that my county is willing to let go of those who truly love their children and worry for their future.  Who actually go home and cry about their children because she is worried, but leave the teachers who keep the Principals hanging in the balance if they are returning to the school or not or the teachers that say that "there will always have to be McDonalds workers".  I believe in my students.  Please tell me what I need to do besides emailing and writing.  I am willing to fight for my job as well as my students future.  Please help!

Sincerely,
Stephanie Stuart

> Preparing for Hurricane Season

Hurricane Season begins on Monday and ends on Nov. 30.††North Carolina will be ready in the event†of a†tropical storm or hurricane.† In addition to encouraging North Carolina's families to prepare, Gov. Perdue is working to ensure that the state is prepared to respond to a disaster.† On Thursday, Gov. Perdue, cabinet officials and state emergency management officials†conducted a simulation exercise, rehearsing the roles and responsibilities of each agency during a disaster.†
In addition, Gov. Perdue proclaimed this week "Hurricane Preparedness Week."† This year marks the 10th anniversary of the state‚Äôs costliest and most destructive storm.† On Sept. 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck our state leaving behind 52 deaths and $6 billion in damages.†
‚ÄúIn North Carolina we understand from experience the power and destruction of hurricanes.† With hurricane season approaching, I ask us all to be prepared,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúI urge all families, businesses and local governments to check your emergency plans and emergency kits before any disaster strikes.‚Äù†
North Carolina ranks second only to Florida in vulnerability to hurricanes. Citizens are urged to assemble emergency supply kits, then make and rehearse plans for where to go and what to do if a hurricane threatens the state.
Citizens are also encouraged to review and update their homeowners‚Äô insurance policies to make sure they include coverage for accidental damage and natural disasters and, if necessary, flood insurance.
Families should have an emergency plan and emergency supplies kit ready to go at all times.† The kit should contain enough non-perishable food and a gallon of water per person per day to last three to seven days.† The kit should also include the following essentials:
¬∑†††††††† Copies of insurance papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag
¬∑†††††††† First-aid kit
¬∑†††††††† Weather radio and batteries
¬∑†††††††† Supply of prescription medicines
¬∑†††††††† Bedding
¬∑†††††††† Changes of clothes
¬∑†††††††† Hygiene items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and deodorant
¬∑†††††††† Cash or checkbook
¬∑†††††††† Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records
People should stay informed during a storm by keeping a battery-powered radio for weather and evacuation information and should know evacuation routes in their community.† They also need to heed the warnings of state and local officials and evacuate quickly when told to do so.
Citizens can evacuate their homes with small, domestic pets to specially designated pet-friendly shelters.† Pet shelters will be equipped with pet crates, but people should bring feeding dishes, food and water, immunization papers and other pet supplies.
For more information on how to prepare for any type of emergency, visit <http://www.readync.org/>www.ReadyNC.org.†

Gov. Perdue Announces $62 Million in Crime Prevention†Grants

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced the awarding of $62 million in grants to state and local agencies to improve community safety and assist crime victims.†
After reviewing more than 520 grant applications, the Governor‚Äôs Crime Commission (GCC) made awards for 315 programs in 86 counties, five universities and six state agencies. The money will help efforts to stop gangs, fight juvenile delinquency, assist victims of domestic violence and provide updated equipment for law enforcement agencies.
‚ÄúThese grants are making a real difference in reducing crime and protecting our citizens,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúWe want to keep our people safe, help those who have been victimized and provide law enforcement with the additional resources to get the job done.‚Äù
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=440>To see a list of the 315 grants, please see the attached document here.

Contracts Awarded to 17 Additional Transportation Recovery Projects

Contracts have been awarded for 17 additional highway projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts total $102.8 million and were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.
‚ÄúThese projects will help create and sustain thousands of jobs and provide needed economic development in counties throughout North Carolina,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThey will improve critical routes to help better connect North Carolinians around the state.‚Äù
The projects are in Alamance, Alexander, Anson, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Cherokee, Cleveland, Cumberland, Durham, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, Nash, Rockingham, Surry, Union, Wake and Yadkin counties. Two resurfacing projects, one on U.S. 64 in Nash/Edgecombe counties and one on I-440 in Wake County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met ‚Äúgood faith effort‚Äù requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.
<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=424>For a list of the projects, see the attached documents here.
The bids received on all 17 economic recovery projects came in nearly 25 percent, about $36.7 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts will start in late June or early July.
The transportation projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.
In addition to helping create jobs, the 17 projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. Fifteen of the projects entail resurfacing or rehabilitation of major routes across the state. One project will complete grading work for a stretch of the Fayetteville Outer Loop, and†another is for a bridge replacement.
For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov/>www.ncdot.gov.

New National Guard Joint Force Headquarters

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev†Perdue, Congressman David Price and Major General William Ingram broke ground on the new National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in Raleigh. The building will also house offices for the State Highway Patrol, Division of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation.†The joint operation will ease cooperation during emergency situations.†
Construction of the†237,000 sq. ft. facility will create over 4,000 jobs, and $41.5 million of the $56 million projected cost will come from federal recovery funds.†

> First Gentleman Eaves Donates Books to Halifax and Rutherford County Elementary Schools

First Gentleman Bob Eaves donated 500 summer reading books through the Scholastic Summer Challenge to Inborden Elementary School in Halifax County and to Harris Elementary School in Rutherford County.† The Scholastic Summer Challenge is a national literacy campaign that raises awareness of the importance of summer reading among children, families, teachers and librarians.
‚ÄúSummer is a time for students to relax and prepare for the upcoming school year.† With that preparation comes the important task of keeping up with and improving on their reading skills,‚Äù†Mr. Eaves said.† ‚ÄúI want all children to have fun while reading this summer, and I hope they enjoy these new books during the summer.‚Äù
Harris Elementary School is located across the street from the birth place of Mr. Eaves‚Äô father.† Mr. Eaves also wanted to donate to Halifax County in support of the current challenges the school district is correcting.
Mr. Eaves is one of more than 30 first spouses who are participating in the challenge.
The State Library of North Carolina also has a Summer Reading Program, which encouraged 136,000 individual North Carolina children and teens to register at their local libraries for the program in 2008.
The state library is part of the Collaborative Summer Library Programs, a grassroots organization of states committed to delivering high-quality summer reading programs to its children at the lowest cost possible for its public libraries.† For more information, please contact Lori Special, youth services consultant for the State Library of North Carolina, at 919-807-7425.†

Global Manufacturer to Expand in Eden, Relocate Headquarters to Cary

Loparex LLC, a global manufacturer of polycoated and silicone-coated papers and films, will expand its manufacturing operation in Eden and relocate its U.S. headquarters from a Chicago suburb to Cary. The company plans to invest $18.9 million and create 128 jobs -- 68 in Eden and 60 in Cary -- during the next three-and-a-half†years.
‚ÄúThis project demonstrates clearly the unique qualities that make North Carolina a top choice for global companies looking to invest and expand,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúWe are able to provide a well-trained workforce with experience in advanced manufacturing - still a very important part of our economy - as well as top scientific talent for research and development collaboration, resulting in 128 well-paying, sustainable jobs.‚Äù
Under terms of the performance-based grant, the average annual wage of the Eden jobs will be $52,323, not including benefits, significantly greater than the Rockingham County average of $29,796. The average annual wage for jobs in Cary will be $93,347, not including benefits, more than twice the Wake County average wage of $43,160.
Loparex currently has 92 employees in North Carolina, all at its Rockingham county manufacturing facility. Of the $18.9 million planned investment, $16.9 million will go to the Rockingham County expansion; $2 million will go to Wake County for the new headquarters.

So with all of the cuts you are implementing in education, I have but one question for you.  Where has all of the money from the so-called NC Education Lottery?  You are abusing your state employees when the lottery was supposed to make up for shortfalls in education funding.  You have unfairly taxed a minority of the population when the lottery was supposed, as promised by the politicians that supported and promoted it, to prevent these very cuts.  You are forcing a few to pay for the entire state's shortfall.  Would it not be more fair to simply add a one or two cent per gallon tax on gasoline that would allow everyone to participate equally in meeting the budget shortfall?  But then again, if you taxed the entire state it would likely turn everyone against you instead of the relatively few state employees endangering your chance of getting a second term.  Remember, however, we may be few in number, but we have lots of friends and very loud voices.  By making one mad you can guarantee we will let at least 100 others know how we have been abused.

I recently requested information about a class of NC license plates with a USA theme. Alabama, Illinois and Arizona are just a few of the states that already have USA themed license plates. Is it not possible for the state of North Carolina to also have these license plates? Does a petition need to be started? The NCDMV told me to contact the office of the governor. Thanks for your help.

Preparing for Hurricane Season

Hurricane Season begins on Monday and ends on Nov. 30.††North Carolina will be ready in the event†of a†tropical storm or hurricane.† In addition to encouraging North Carolina's families to prepare, Gov. Perdue is working to ensure that the state is prepared to respond to a disaster.† On Thursday, Gov. Perdue, cabinet officials and state emergency management officials†conducted a simulation exercise, rehearsing the roles and responsibilities of each agency during a disaster.†

In addition, Gov. Perdue proclaimed this week "Hurricane Preparedness Week."† This year marks the 10th anniversary of the stateís costliest and most destructive storm.† On Sept. 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck our state leaving behind 52 deaths and $6 billion in damages.†

ìIn North Carolina we understand from experience the power and destruction of hurricanes.† With hurricane season approaching, I ask us all to be prepared,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìI urge all families, businesses and local governments to check your emergency plans and emergency kits before any disaster strikes.î†

North Carolina ranks second only to Florida in vulnerability to hurricanes. Citizens are urged to assemble emergency supply kits, then make and rehearse plans for where to go and what to do if a hurricane threatens the state.

Citizens are also encouraged to review and update their homeownersí insurance policies to make sure they include coverage for accidental damage and natural disasters and, if necessary, flood insurance.

Families should have an emergency plan and emergency supplies kit ready to go at all times.† The kit should contain enough non-perishable food and a gallon of water per person per day to last three to seven days.† The kit should also include the following essentials:

∑†††††††† Copies of insurance papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag

∑†††††††† First-aid kit

∑†††††††† Weather radio and batteries

∑†††††††† Supply of prescription medicines

∑†††††††† Bedding

∑†††††††† Changes of clothes

∑†††††††† Hygiene items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and deodorant

∑†††††††† Cash or checkbook

∑†††††††† Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records

People should stay informed during a storm by keeping a battery-powered radio for weather and evacuation information and should know evacuation routes in their community.† They also need to heed the warnings of state and local officials and evacuate quickly when told to do so.

Citizens can evacuate their homes with small, domestic pets to specially designated pet-friendly shelters.† Pet shelters will be equipped with pet crates, but people should bring feeding dishes, food and water, immunization papers and other pet supplies.

For more information on how to prepare for any type of emergency, visit <http://www.ReadyNC.org>www.ReadyNC.org.†

Gov. Perdue Announces $62 Million in Crime Prevention†Grants

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced the awarding of $62 million in grants to state and local agencies to improve community safety and assist crime victims.†

After reviewing more than 520 grant applications, the Governorís Crime Commission (GCC) made awards for 315 programs in 86 counties, five universities and six state agencies. The money will help efforts to stop gangs, fight juvenile delinquency, assist victims of domestic violence and provide updated equipment for law enforcement agencies.

ìThese grants are making a real difference in reducing crime and protecting our citizens,î Gov. Perdue said.† ìWe want to keep our people safe, help those who have been victimized and provide law enforcement with the additional resources to get the job done.î

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=440>To see a list of the 315 grants, please see the attached document here.

Contracts Awarded to 17 Additional Transportation Recovery Projects

Contracts have been awarded for 17 additional highway projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts total $102.8 million and were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

ìThese projects will help create and sustain thousands of jobs and provide needed economic development in counties throughout North Carolina,î said Gov. Perdue. ìThey will improve critical routes to help better connect North Carolinians around the state.î

The projects are in Alamance, Alexander, Anson, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Cherokee, Cleveland, Cumberland, Durham, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, Nash, Rockingham, Surry, Union, Wake and Yadkin counties. Two resurfacing projects, one on U.S. 64 in Nash/Edgecombe counties and one on I-440 in Wake County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met ìgood faith effortî requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=424>For a list of the projects, see the attached documents here.

The bids received on all 17 economic recovery projects came in nearly 25 percent, about $36.7 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts will start in late June or early July.

The transportation projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.

In addition to helping create jobs, the 17 projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. Fifteen of the projects entail resurfacing or rehabilitation of major routes across the state. One project will complete grading work for a stretch of the Fayetteville Outer Loop, and†another is for a bridge replacement.

For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

New National Guard Joint Force Headquarters

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev†Perdue, Congressman David Price and Major General William Ingram broke ground on the new National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in Raleigh. The building will also house offices for the State Highway Patrol, Division of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation.†The joint operation will ease cooperation during emergency situations.†

Construction of the†237,000 sq. ft. facility will create over 4,000 jobs, and $41.5 million of the $56 million projected cost will come from federal recovery funds.†

Perdue is "Did you receive your pay cut as well?" It would be only fair to the rest of us who also work for the state of North Carolina.



Secondly, "Will you be working your 10-hour furlough without pay as well"? After all, she does work for the state of North Carolina.



Finally, I voted for Gov. Perdue in November because of her support for teachers, being that she was once in the classroom herself. I thought she would be more supportive than governors in the past. After all, she should know how little money teachers bring home after taxes, insurance, etc.†However, I'm beginning to see that I was wrong.



When it is time for Gov. Perdue to run for re-election, and I'm sure that she will, I will not be giving her my vote, and I will be doing everything in my power to convince my co-workers and other teachers in the district and state to do the same. I am disappointed.



Again, please forward this to the necessary people if need be. I look forward to hearing from someone soon.



Respectfully submitted,

Mrs. Nancy S. Floyd

5th Grade Teacher, CMS

I Governor Perdue. I am very interested in serving in Government in some way. I have a Bachelors Degree in Business Administrations and I am thinking of going back to school to get my Masters once I find the career job I am looking for. I spoke to Tate Johnson who works for you and he said that he will keep me in mind if they have any openings. I know the State is in a budget crisiss so I will be patience until something comes up. I just want to know if there is anything I could do that would give me a better chance of landing a job. I don't have any experience but I know that I want to get involved in politics in some way or another. I just need a little direction and a little help.

Thanks!

My employees have "heard" a rumor that the Governor is proposing a "pay cut"
for State Employees for next year to the tune of 8 to 10 per cent.  Is there
any truth to this rumor???

> Preparing for Hurricane Season

Hurricane Season begins on Monday and ends on Nov. 30.††North Carolina will be ready in the event†of a†tropical storm or hurricane.† In addition to encouraging North Carolina's families to prepare, Gov. Perdue is working to ensure that the state is prepared to respond to a disaster.† On Thursday, Gov. Perdue, cabinet officials and state emergency management officials†conducted a simulation exercise, rehearsing the roles and responsibilities of each agency during a disaster.†

> In addition, Gov. Perdue proclaimed this week "Hurricane Preparedness Week."† This year marks the 10th anniversary of the state‚Äôs costliest and most destructive storm.† On Sept. 16, 1999, Hurricane Floyd struck our state leaving behind 52 deaths and $6 billion in damages.†

> ‚ÄúIn North Carolina we understand from experience the power and destruction of hurricanes.† With hurricane season approaching, I ask us all to be prepared,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.† ‚ÄúI urge all families, businesses and local governments to check your emergency plans and emergency kits before any disaster strikes.‚Äù†

> North Carolina ranks second only to Florida in vulnerability to hurricanes. Citizens are urged to assemble emergency supply kits, then make and rehearse plans for where to go and what to do if a hurricane threatens the state.

> Citizens are also encouraged to review and update their homeowners‚Äô insurance policies to make sure they include coverage for accidental damage and natural disasters and, if necessary, flood insurance.

> Families should have an emergency plan and emergency supplies kit ready to go at all times.† The kit should contain enough non-perishable food and a gallon of water per person per day to last three to seven days.† The kit should also include the following essentials:

> ¬∑†††††††† Copies of insurance papers and identification sealed in a watertight plastic bag

> ¬∑†††††††† First-aid kit

> ¬∑†††††††† Weather radio and batteries

> ¬∑†††††††† Supply of prescription medicines

> ¬∑†††††††† Bedding

> ¬∑†††††††† Changes of clothes

> ¬∑†††††††† Hygiene items such as toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and deodorant

> ¬∑†††††††† Cash or checkbook

> ¬∑†††††††† Pet supplies including food, water, leashes, bedding, muzzle and vaccination records

> People should stay informed during a storm by keeping a battery-powered radio for weather and evacuation information and should know evacuation routes in their community.† They also need to heed the warnings of state and local officials and evacuate quickly when told to do so.

> Citizens can evacuate their homes with small, domestic pets to specially designated pet-friendly shelters.† Pet shelters will be equipped with pet crates, but people should bring feeding dishes, food and water, immunization papers and other pet supplies.

> Gov. Perdue Announces $62 Million in Crime Prevention†Grants

Gov. Bev Perdue this week†announced the awarding of $62 million in grants to state and local agencies to improve community safety and assist crime victims.†

> After reviewing more than 520 grant applications, the Governor‚Äôs Crime Commission (GCC) made awards for 315 programs in 86 counties, five universities and six state agencies. The money will help efforts to stop gangs, fight juvenile delinquency, assist victims of domestic violence and provide updated equipment for law enforcement agencies.

> ‚ÄúThese grants are making a real difference in reducing crime and protecting our citizens,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said.† ‚ÄúWe want to keep our people safe, help those who have been victimized and provide law enforcement with the additional resources to get the job done.‚Äù

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=440>> To see a list of the 315 grants, please see the attached document here.

> Contracts Awarded to 17 Additional Transportation Recovery Projects

Contracts have been awarded for 17 additional highway projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The contracts total $102.8 million and were awarded by Transportation Secretary Gene Conti to the lowest respective bidder, as required by state law.

> ‚ÄúThese projects will help create and sustain thousands of jobs and provide needed economic development in counties throughout North Carolina,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThey will improve critical routes to help better connect North Carolinians around the state.‚Äù

> The projects are in Alamance, Alexander, Anson, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Cherokee, Cleveland, Cumberland, Durham, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, Nash, Rockingham, Surry, Union, Wake and Yadkin counties. Two resurfacing projects, one on U.S. 64 in Nash/Edgecombe counties and one on I-440 in Wake County, will be awarded if the low bidder demonstrates that it has met ‚Äúgood faith effort‚Äù requirements in attempting to reach the disadvantaged business enterprise goals set forth in the contracts.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=424>> For a list of the projects, see the attached documents here.

> The bids received on all 17 economic recovery projects came in nearly 25 percent, about $36.7 million, below NCDOT estimates. Work on all contracts will start in late June or early July.

> The transportation projects announced to date are expected to help create and sustain more than 20,000 jobs and generate more than $4 billion in economic development.

> In addition to helping create jobs, the 17 projects awarded will complete needed infrastructure improvements. Fifteen of the projects entail resurfacing or rehabilitation of major routes across the state. One project will complete grading work for a stretch of the Fayetteville Outer Loop, and†another is for a bridge replacement.

> For more information about recovery funding for infrastructure improvements in North Carolina, as well as other NCDOT projects and activities, visit <http://www.ncdot.gov>www.ncdot.gov.

On Tuesday, Gov. Bev†Perdue, Congressman David Price and Major General William Ingram broke ground on the new National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in Raleigh. The building will also house offices for the State Highway Patrol, Division of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation.†The joint operation will ease cooperation during emergency situations.†

> Construction of the†237,000 sq. ft. facility will create over 4,000 jobs, and $41.5 million of the $56 million projected cost will come from federal recovery funds.†

> First Gentleman Eaves Donates Books to Halifax and Rutherford County Elementary Schools

First Gentleman Bob Eaves donated 500 summer reading books through the Scholastic Summer Challenge to Inborden Elementary School in Halifax County and to Harris Elementary School in Rutherford County.† The Scholastic Summer Challenge is a national literacy campaign that raises awareness of the importance of summer reading among children, families, teachers and librarians.

> ‚ÄúSummer is a time for students to relax and prepare for the upcoming school year.† With that preparation comes the important task of keeping up with and improving on their reading skills,‚Äù†Mr. Eaves said..† ‚ÄúI want all children to have fun while reading this summer, and I hope they enjoy these new books during the summer.‚Äù

> Harris Elementary School is located across the street from the birth place of Mr. Eaves‚Äô father.† Mr. Eaves also wanted to donate to Halifax County in support of the current challenges the school district is correcting.

> Mr. Eaves is one of more than 30 first spouses who are participating in the challenge.

> The State Library of North Carolina also has a Summer Reading Program, which encouraged 136,000 individual North Carolina children and teens to register at their local libraries for the program in 2008.

> The state library is part of the Collaborative Summer Library Programs, a grassroots organization of states committed to delivering high-quality summer reading programs to its children at the lowest cost possible for its public libraries.† For more information, please contact Lori Special, youth services consultant for the State Library of North Carolina, at 919-807-7425.†

> Global Manufacturer to Expand in Eden, Relocate Headquarters to Cary

Loparex LLC, a global manufacturer of polycoated and silicone-coated papers and films, will expand its manufacturing operation in Eden and relocate its U.S. headquarters from a Chicago suburb to Cary. The company plans to invest $18.9 million and create 128 jobs -- 68 in Eden and 60 in Cary -- during the next three-and-a-half†years.

> ‚ÄúThis project demonstrates clearly the unique qualities that make North Carolina a top choice for global companies looking to invest and expand,‚Äù Gov. Perdue said. ‚ÄúWe are able to provide a well-trained workforce with experience in advanced manufacturing - still a very important part of our economy - as well as top scientific talent for research and development collaboration, resulting in 128 well-paying, sustainable jobs.‚Äù

> Under terms of the performance-based grant, the average annual wage of the Eden jobs will be $52,323, not including benefits, significantly greater than the Rockingham County average of $29,796. The average annual wage for jobs in Cary will be $93,347, not including benefits, more than twice the Wake County average wage of $43,160.

> Loparex currently has 92 employees in North Carolina, all at its Rockingham county manufacturing facility. Of the $18.9 million planned investment, $16.9 million will go to the Rockingham County expansion; $2 million will go to Wake County for the new headquarters.

HMMM....I think the complaint mostly is about the actions of the Clerk of Superior Court.† Check with Eddie Speas....I think that the reply should be that if he suspects the Clerk of Superior Court of criminal activity, he should contact the District Attorney.

<http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx><http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>Governor Bev Perdue†this week†announced her energy reform package to attract businesses, create jobs and promote a strong and sustainable green economy in North Carolina. She made the announcement at the SAS Solar Farm in Cary, which provides solar-generated power to Progress Energy.

> ìDeveloping our green economy is a cornerstone of my vision for North Carolinaís economic future,î Gov. Perdue said. ìCreating green jobs and businesses is a key part of my JobsNOW initiative, and the energy reforms I am implementing will lay the foundation for North Carolina to lead the nation in green energy.î

> Gov. Perdueís energy plan refocuses state energy policymaking, makes strategic investments in North Carolinaís green economy and increases green-collar workforce development.

> ìThe state that gets green right will own the next 50 years,î Gov. Perdue said. ìI intend for North Carolina to be that state.î

> Governor Perdueís energy plan includes:

> - Relocating the State Energy Office and state weatherization program to the Department of Commerce

> - Reinvigorating the Energy Policy Council

> - Establishing an Energy Investment Revolving Loan Fund

> - Expanding the Green Business Fund

> - Growing North Carolinaís green workforce

> - Investing federal recovery monies for other energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in small businesses, communities and homes across North Carolina

> Governor Perdue Launches JobsNOW Portal

Gov. Bev Perdue today launched the <http://www.jobsnow.nc.gov/>JobsNOW Portal, a user-friendly resource for job seekers, those exploring new career options, and entrepreneurs looking to start, grow or relocate a business in North Carolina.

> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>> <http://www.governor.state.nc.us/jobsNow.aspx>> ìJobsNOW will help get our economy back on track and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThe JobsNOW Portal will be a valuable tool for job seekers and businesses looking to expand or relocate.î

> The JobsNOW Portal is part of Governor Perdueís JobsNOW initiative, which brings together state agencies, local governments, business leaders and citizens to create new jobs, put people back to work and train and retrain our workers for success.†

> Gov. Perdue Signs Legislation Prohibiting Smoking in Bars and Restaurant

Gov. Bev Perdue†on Tuesday†signed House Bill 2, which prohibits smoking in public bars and restaurants. Rep. Hugh Holliman and Sen. Bill Purcell led the efforts to pass this landmark legislation. The smoking ban will go into effect on Jan. 2, 2010, and will be enforced by local health directors.

> ìThis is a historic day for North Carolina,î said†Gov. Perdue. ìBut more important than the history that we are making is the positive impact we are having on public health. By banning smoking in our restaurants and bars, we will greatly reduce the dangers of secondhand smoke and lower health care costs for families.î

> According to a report by the United States Surgeon General, secondhand smoke causes the death of approximately 50,000 citizens a year. In addition, a study prepared by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina found that exposure to secondhand smoke costs North Carolinians $289 million annually.

> "I am extremely happy with this legislation becoming a reality. This is a gigantic step in improving the public health for the citizens of our great state, and I'm glad I was able to play a part in making this bill a law," said Holliman.

> "This new law is a significant step for public health in North Carolina.† Restaurant and bar patrons and employees will no longer be exposed to the dangers of secondhand smoke.† I want to thank Rep. Holliman for all his hard work in this important step forward for our state and its future," said Purcell.

> Gov. Perdue Orders Highway Patrol to Implement New Travel Records Protocol

Gov. Perdue this week ordered the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety and the State Highway Patrol to implement new travel record keeping protocols for security details assigned to both the governor and lieutenant governor.

> ìIíve pledged to run an open and transparent administration,î said Gov. Perdue.† ìThis new protocol will provide clear direction for how the State Highway Patrol executive security detail collects and retains travel records.î

> The new travel record form will include detailed information about each trip outside of Wake County taken by the governor or lieutenant governor when a member of the executive security detail provides protection.

> ìGovernor Perdue has made it clear that her entire administration should operate with the highest standards of openness, and thatís exactly what we intend to do,î said CCPS Secretary Reuben Young.

> All records will be maintained by the State Highway Patrol for four years after the governor or lieutenant governorís term, at which point they will be transferred to state archives.

Governor Perdue: HGEA Slates 2009 HGEA Retiree Convention June 9-10 at Ala Moana Hotel and I'll be a delegate there! On the disappointing news to report, our Republican Governor Linda Lingle has ordered 3 day Furloughs for State workers, which appoint to a pay cut for State employees, which will hurt our Economy in her effort to balance the State budget at State worker expense. Frankie & Heather Kam Hawaii Statehood celebration will be in August!

> Gov. Perdue Welcomes Apple to North Carolina

Apple has selected North Carolina as the location for a new data center.¬† The company is expected to invest more than $1 billion in the project over nine years.

> ‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to be a prime location for growing and expanding global technology companies,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.¬† ‚ÄúWe welcome Apple to North Carolina and look forward to working with the company as it begins providing a significant economic boost to local communities and the state.‚Äù

> The announcement comes after Perdue signed Senate Bill 575, which modifies the method by which capital-intensive businesses calculate corporate income tax liability in North Carolina.

> The facility is expected to employ at least 50 full-time employees.¬† The legislation requires that the average wage exceed the wage standard of the county in which it‚Äôs located.¬† A data center such as this will typically contract locally for services such as server maintenance and repair, building and HVAC maintenance, landscaping and security ‚Äì expenditures that could range from $5 million to $6 million annually in the region and create up to 250 jobs.¬† The North Carolina Department of Commerce projects that a data center investment of $1 billion would create more than 3,000 jobs in the regional economy, including hundreds of jobs related to construction and others created as a result of economic growth.

> As part of the legislation, a capital-intensive industry must meet investment and wage standards and provide its employees with health insurance.¬† It also must locate in one of the state‚Äôs more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 areas.

> ‚ÄúDuring these tough economic times, it‚Äôs important to make the investments that create jobs in areas that need them the most,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.

> State Grant Helps Ethan Allen Expand in Maiden, Create 302 Jobs

Ethan Allen Operations Inc., a manufacturer of high-quality upholstered furniture for residential and commercial customers, will expand in Maiden.¬† The company will create 302 jobs and invest $2.79 million during the next three years.

> ‚ÄúNorth Carolina continues to support high-value national operations creating new jobs for our people despite current economic challenges,‚Äù Perdue said.¬† ‚ÄúOur state remains attractive to established companies, which know the value of our top business climate, skilled workforce and tremendous quality of life.‚Äù

> Ethan Allen Operations is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (NYSE:ETH), with headquarters in Connecticut. The company is a leading manufacturer and retailer of quality home furnishings and operates eight manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including two sawmills and one manufacturing facility in Mexico. The company‚Äôs two Maiden plants manufacture custom-made, handcrafted upholstered furniture.

> The company is leaving a leased facility in California and consolidating those operations to its Maiden facilities, which currently employ 540 workers.¬† The move will replace 143 jobs lost in previous layoffs and will add 159 new jobs for a total of 302 jobs.

> The announcement was made possible in part by a $109,000 grant from the One North Carolina Fund.¬† Although individual wages will vary by job type, the jobs will pay an annual average wage of $39,946, higher than the Catawba County average wage of $34,216.

> North Carolina continues to have a top ranked business climate.¬† Through Governor Perdue‚Äôs JobsNOW initiative, the state will work aggressively to create jobs, train and retrain our workforce and lay the foundation for a strong and sustainable economic future.

> Gov. Perdue Launches Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program

Gov. Perdue today launched the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program at Wrightsboro Elementary School in Wilmington to promote the retention and growth of student reading skills during the summer break. Studies show that students who don‚Äôt read during the summer vacation are more likely to lag behind their peers‚Äô reading level when they return to school in the fall.

> ‚ÄúThe summer is a time for fun, family and a break from school ‚Äì but learning is something we should do 365 days a year, seven days a week,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúThrough the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program, we can encourage our kids have a good book in their hands even when they‚Äôre away from the classroom. And we can make sure students continue to learn ‚Äì and learn to love reading.‚Äù

> Perdue read to a third grade class and talked to them about the importance and joy or reading. She demonstrated the new Find-a-Book Web site, <http://www.lexile.com/findabook>www.lexile.com/findabook, to parents, students and school staff. The Find-a-Book web site contains a searchable database that matches a book‚Äôs text difficulty to a student‚Äôs reading ability through a Lexile reading measure. In North Carolina, students in grades 3-8, as well as high school students taking the English I state assessment, will receive a Lexile measure in their end-of-year test results. Lexile is the most widely adopted reading measure in use today.

> Perdue urged school faculty to promote the summer reading program to parents, while encouraging community members to become involved in the summer reading program as volunteers and mentors. The governor has sent letters and informational fliers to principals and librarians. Parents will receive letters and information on the summer reading initiative with their child‚Äôs end-of-year report card.

> Public libraries across the state are also participating in the Find-a-Book Summer Reading Program. Library staff can assist parents and students with the Find-a-Book Web site and Lexile reading measures.

> Today also marks the 100 year anniversary of Wrightsboro Elementary.

> Defense Spending Increased in North Carolina During the 2008 Fiscal Year

Gov. Bev Perdue and the North Carolina Military Business Center (NCMBC) announced this week that Department of Defense spending in North Carolina grew by 22 percent and exceeded $3.6 billion in federal fiscal year 2008 ‚Äì an increase of $657 million from 2007.

> ‚ÄúThese numbers are yet another indicator that the Tar Heel state is becoming a very significant player in the global military and defense industry cluster,‚Äù said Gov. Perdue.¬† ‚ÄúThe time to capitalize on this trend is now, to leverage expanding markets, capture federal revenues and grow jobs right here in North Carolina ‚Äì the most military friendly state in America.‚Äù

> Gov. Perdue was instrumental, with the General Assembly, in establishing the NCMBC in the Community College System and the Defense and Security Technology Accelerator (DSTA) in Fayetteville.¬† She also spearheaded the development of the North Carolina Military Foundation, a private organization focused on recruiting defense contractors and growing the state‚Äôs defense and homeland security economy.

> According to a 2008 Department of Commerce study, the military has a $23.4 billion total annual impact on the state economy.¬† Defense procurement in North Carolina, based on place of performance, increased from $2.9 billion in federal fiscal year 2007 to $3.6 billion in 2008.¬† During the same time frame, spending by all federal agencies in North Carolina increased approximately $743 million, or 16 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.2 billion.

> For more information on Department of Defense spending and the North Carolina Military Business Center, please visit <http://www.ncmbc.us>www.ncmbc.us.

> Economic Recovery Workshops

Governor Perdue hosted two Economic Recovery Workshops this week.¬† The workshops in Raleigh and Wilmington were the fourth and fifth in a series of six workshops to provide information and guidance to local municipalities, businesses and interested citizens on how the federal recovery funds will be administered. The sixth and final workshop in this series will be held in Charlotte on June 18.

> Law Enforcement Cites 15,132 Unbuckled People During "Click it or Ticket" Campaign

More than 15,000 drivers and passengers were cited for not wearing their seat belts or having their child properly buckled during the ‚ÄúClick It or Ticket‚Äù campaign, which began May 18 and ended May 31.

> "I thank law enforcement officers across the state who participated in this life-saving campaign," said Gov. Perdue. ‚ÄúI urge North Carolinians who still choose to remain unbuckled to think twice and remember that a seat belt or proper child safety seat could save your life or the life of a loved one.‚Äù

> The final statewide total for the campaign includes 13,654 seat belt citations and 1,478 child passenger safety citations.¬† State and local law enforcement officers issued the citations at more than 8,500 checkpoints and with stepped-up patrols.

> The N.C. Governor‚Äôs Highway Safety Program administers ‚ÄúClick It or Ticket.‚Äù The program began as a national pilot project in 1993 to increase seat belt usage and child passenger safety through stepped-up enforcement of the state‚Äôs seat belt and child safety seat laws.

> The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that North Carolina‚Äôs 2008 seat belt usage rate was 89.8 percent, its highest rate ever. A NHTSA study published last year showed that when worn correctly, seat belts reduce the risk of a front seat passenger being killed in a crash by 45 percent.
