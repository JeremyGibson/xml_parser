Gentlemen:

This news is breaking in the Fayetteville area where I am working with our
regional Commerce office and 30-local leaders at the Southeast Regional
Partnership annual economic development planning workshop.

The community and company wish for Governor Perdue to keynote their
ribbon-cutting ceremony in June.

Pearse - please share with the Governor's communication staff. Kathy is

Major Defense
Contractor to call Fayetteville - Cumberland County Home

                                           
Fayetteville, NC Office Expected to Employ 300 

 

Fayetteville, NC- Booz Allen Hamilton, a long-time
contractor to the Department of Defense and U.S. Army Forces Command and
Reserve Command, has elected to expand their office in Fayetteville, according
to Douglas Peters, PresidentÂ  &amp; CEO of the Fayetteville âCumberland County
Chamber of Commerce.Â  A planned June ribbon cutting will officially open the
companyâs Fayetteville location.

 

âOur firm had the option of locating literally anywhere to
support our work with FORSCOM and USARC,â said William Butler, the Booz Allen
executive who is heading the relocation effort from Fort McPherson to
Fayetteville.Â  âWe chose Fayetteville and Cumberland County for two reasons â
one, the community worked hard to assist us in our search for a viable
location, and also we found that the communityâs economic development
partnership with the city and county â allowed for a seamless process by which
to make our decision,â Butler added.

 

Booz Allen Hamilton first began the process of site
selection nearly 18 months ago.Â  Other locations considered were outside the 11
County BRAC region.

 

âBooz Allen Hamilton represents the pinnacle of firms that
we are positioned to welcome to our growing community,â said Dan Dederick,
Chamber Chairman of the Board.Â  âThis announcement marks the culmination of
months of effort to ensure that the firm has a strong platform by which to continue
its work on behalf of the U.S. military and other clients.â

 

Local elected leaders have participated strongly in the
recruitment of Booz Allen to the area, according to Bo Gregory, Economic
Development Program Manager for the Chamber.Â Â  âWhat has made this effort
successful is that we, as a community, have worked collectively to illustrate
to the company why Fayetteville and Cumberland County is the optimal place to
do business with Fort Bragg.Â Â  Our local government leadership has played a
vital role in this success for the area,â Gregory said.Â  

 

âWeâre excited to offer relocation to Fayetteville to our
Atlanta-based workforce,â said Butler.Â  âWe also anticipate significant hiring
from within the local community to support our mission in the market.â 

 

According to Butler, the firm will locate in the former
Wachovia Bank building at the intersection of the All American Freeway,
Morganton and Sycamore Dairy Roads. More than 30 Booz Allen Hamilton
representatives currently work in the community, both on Fort Bragg and in
their new location.Â  That number will grow to an estimated 300 over time.
